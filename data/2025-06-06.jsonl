At times,\ninteractions also involve transitioning among entities represented in different\ndimensions. We introduce the concept of mixed-dimensional information space,\nencompassing entities represented in both 2D and 3D. Interactions within the\nmixed-dimensional information space should be seamless and efficient: users\nshould be able to focus on their primary tasks without being distracted by\ninteractions with or transitions between entities. While incorporating 3D\nrepresentations into the mixed-dimensional information space offers intuitive\nand immersive ways to interact with complex information, it is important to\naddress potential seams and inefficiencies that arise while interacting with\nboth 2D and 3D entities.

The\ninitial version of the AI Explainability Framework was validated based on an\nin-depth expert engagement and review process. For evaluation purposes, an\nAI-anchored prototype, incorporating novel explainability features, was built\nand deployed online. The primary function of the prototype was to predict the\npostpartum depression risk using analytics models.

The\nSystem Explainability Scale (SES) metric was developed to measure the influence\nof the three dimensions of the AI Explainability Framework. For the summative\nstage, a comprehensive usability test was conducted involving 20 clinicians,\nand the SES metric was used to assess clinicians` satisfaction with the tool.\nOn a 5-point rating system, the tool received high scores for the usability\ndimension, followed by trust and understandability.

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics.

We\nintroduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,\nprioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield\ninformative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we\ndevelop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small\nreference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions\nis then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce\nrollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent\nrollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.\nExtensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method\nreduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of\nperformance as the original GRPO algorithm."}

Although modern LLMs compute over vectors\nrather than symbols, an analogous problem arises for these systems, which we\ncall the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two main goals. First, we\ndistinguish five main notions of grounding that are often conflated in the\nliterature, and argue that only one of them, which we call referential\ngrounding, is relevant to the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on\nphilosophical theories of representational content, we provide two arguments\nfor the claim that LLMs and related systems can achieve referential grounding:\n(1) through preference fine-tuning methods that explicitly establish\nworld-involving functions, and (2) through pre-training alone, which in limited\ndomains may select for internal states with world-involving content, as\nmechanistic interpretability research suggests.

Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention\nbecomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically\nwith sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence.

We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts back-propagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$.

To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant\nvisual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models\nthe interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves\nbetween tokens across layers.

However, its\ntheoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose\nthe first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear\nregression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the\nretrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the\nclassical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our\nanalysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on\nRAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model\nretrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing\nuniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample\nefficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks,\nsuch as Natural Questions and TriviaQA."}

Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful\nGPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive\nimage perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through\ncarefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on\nsemantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being\ncommonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this\ninsight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon\nsemantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and\ncontrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1\nachieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image\nunderstanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source\nthe UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation\nscripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research."}
