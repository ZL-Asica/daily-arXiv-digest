Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have\nachieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind\nstate-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we\nseek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)\nretrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism\nenables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and\nargument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and\ncorrect inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three\nwidely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012).

We would like to discuss whether\nwe can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via\nsome interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage\nwould be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.\nAssociation rules have a sound history.

While recent works have explored personality\nevaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and\npersonality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality\nexpression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset\nspans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to\nelicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We\nevaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response\nformats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with\ncountry-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in\nWasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,\nculturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks.

To this end, we\npropose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called\nMLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens\nto extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs\ncustomized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent\ncloze-style \"mask\" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first\nconverts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently\ncombines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus.

Additionally,\nwe develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog\nrepliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation\ngoals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a\ncontinual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and\nsimulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred\ndecision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA\nhas demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order\nplanning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline\nexperiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to\n70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\\times$ to\n$5.47\\times$.

In this paper, we propose a novel Structure GUided text-to-SQL\nframework~(SGU-SQL) that incorporates syntax-based prompting to enhance the SQL\ngeneration capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, SGU-SQL establishes\nstructure-aware links between user queries and database schema and decomposes\nthe complex generation task using syntax-based prompting to enable more\naccurate LLM-based SQL generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that SGU-SQL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\ntext-to-SQL models."}

We instantiate PODS with max-variance down-sampling, a principled\ncriterion that maximises reward diversity and show it admits an $O(n\\log n)$\nsolution. Empirically, coupling PODS with Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) achieves superior performance over standard GRPO across different\nreasoning benchmarks and hardware environments."}

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more\npronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically\nweaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality\nmultimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities\ndue to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct\napplication of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect\nreasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework\nInfi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a\ncurriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal\nreasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning\nActivation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and\nstrengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,\nCross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to\nfacilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.\nThe third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,\ncaption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust\ncross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal\nmath reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision\ntest, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on\nMathVista testmini).

While these led to\nspecialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs\nfor shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to\nreal-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to\nunlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement\nlearning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for\nsynthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in\ndirect fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials\nunderlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms\nsuch as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on\nsynthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both\nin-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit\ngraph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant\nimprovement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\\% over baseline\nsettings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently\noutperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data\nyields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate\nsteps remains a critical challenge even after RL."}

Machine unlearning\n(MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these\nchallenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU)\nstill faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and\nunlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and\nunreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning\nmechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform\nexhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and\nevaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in\nIGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to\nfacilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and\nreliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel\nhierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation\nguidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the\nconstruction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation\nframework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical\naspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can\nbe used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for\njudgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With\nEvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot\nhandle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially\nfor preservation and robustness.

Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical\nmemory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,\nBest-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to\n32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource\nallocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,\nattention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.\nMotivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse\nattention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more\nparallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that\nsparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving\nover 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost\nregimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential\nand increasingly important with more computing invested, for realizing the full\npotential of test-time scaling where, unlike training, accuracy has yet to\nsaturate as a function of computation, and continues to improve through\nincreased generation.
