While\nit is true that digitalization has entered schools, it often follows a process\nof digital replication of approaches and materials that were previously only\navailable on physical media. This work focuses on the use of Extended Realities\nfor teaching mathematics, and very particularly in the teaching of geometry,\nwith a proposition of a conceptual model that combines the use of Extended\nReality and Machine Learning.
