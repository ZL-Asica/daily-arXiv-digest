This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of\nArabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies\n(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)\nacross diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,\nand social media domains.
