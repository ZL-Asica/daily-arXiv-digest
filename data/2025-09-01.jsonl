Focusing on extraversion, we evaluated the system\nin two scenarios: negotiation and ice breaking, using both introverted and\nextroverted agents. In Experiment 1, we conducted agent to agent simulations\nand performed linguistic analysis and personality classification to assess\nwhether the LLM generated language reflected the intended traits and whether\nthe corresponding nonverbal behaviors varied by personality. In Experiment 2,\nwe carried out a user study to evaluate whether these personality aligned\nbehaviors were consistent with their intended traits and perceptible to human\nobservers. Our results show that LLMs can generate verbal and nonverbal\nbehaviors that align with personality traits, and that users are able to\nrecognize these traits through the agents' behaviors. This work underscores the\npotential of LLMs in shaping personality aligned virtual agents."}

In particular, phonological dyslexia causes\nproblems in connecting the sounds of words with their written forms.\nConsequently, affected individuals may encounter issues such as slow reading\nspeed, inaccurate reading, and difficulty decoding unfamiliar words. To address\nthese complexities, the use of compensatory tools and strategies is essential\nto ensure equitable opportunities for dyslexic students. However, the general\nunderestimation of the issue and lack of awareness regarding the significance\nof support methodologies pose significant obstacles. One of the ways to enhance\nconsciousness towards a certain issue is by stimulating empathy with whom is\naffected by it. In light of this, this study introduces a serious game in\nvirtual reality, targeted at educators, students, and, in general, at the\nnon-dyslexic community. The game seeks to enhance understanding of the\nchallenges that individuals with dyslexia experience daily, highlighting the\nrelevance of supportive measures. This approach encourages players to empathize\nwith the struggles of dyslexic individuals and to learn firsthand the\nimportance of supportive methodologies. The final version of the experience was\ntested by 101 participants and evaluated through a specific collection of\nquestionnaires validated in the literature.

This is of particular importance in the healthcare sector, where\neffective communication with patients is essential for achieving professional\ngoals, such as promoting patient well-being by encouraging healthy behaviors.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose LAPI (LLM-based Agent with a Professional\nIdentity), a novel framework for designing professional service agent tailored\nfor medical question-and-answer (Q\\&A) services, ensuring alignment with a\nspecific professional identity.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

This paper proposes\na novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained\nsemantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous\nSemantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from\nlarge language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific\nsemantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of\ninterpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we\napply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain\nactivation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic\nsubdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic\ndimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity\nemerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The\nneural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and\nneuroscientific plausibility."}

Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple\nprompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent\nunderlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of \"ideological depth\"\nin LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political\nrepresentations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch\nbetween liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an\nincreased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.\nSecond, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower\nsteerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our\nevaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than\nanother model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core\npolitical feature in an ideologically \"deep\" model, leading to consistent,\nlogical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same\nintervention in a \"shallow\" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.\nOur findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs\nand that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political\narchitecture."}

In this paper, we propose Strategic Resource\nAllocation (SRA) as an efficiency principle for memory encoding in sentence\nprocessing. The idea is that working memory resources are dynamically and\nstrategically allocated to prioritize novel and unexpected information. From a\nresource-rational perspective, we argue that SRA is the principled solution to\na computational problem posed by two functional assumptions about working\nmemory, namely its limited capacity and its noisy representation. Specifically,\nworking memory needs to minimize the retrieval error of past inputs under the\nconstraint of limited memory resources, an optimization problem whose solution\nis to allocate more resources to encode more surprising inputs with higher\nprecision. One of the critical consequences of SRA is that surprising inputs\nare encoded with enhanced representations, and therefore are less susceptible\nto memory decay and interference. Empirically, through naturalistic corpus\ndata, we find converging evidence for SRA in the context of dependency locality\nfrom both production and comprehension, where non-local dependencies with less\npredictable antecedents are associated with reduced locality effect. However,\nour results also reveal considerable cross-linguistic variability, suggesting\nthe need for a closer examination of how SRA, as a domain-general memory\nefficiency principle, interacts with language-specific phrase structures.

In this work, we focus on the data selection\nproblem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods\nprimarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that\naligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction\ntuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target\ntask. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e.,\ncross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a\nmonotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment\nundermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for\ntask-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a\nnovel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages\npairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for\ntask-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence\nformulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a\nfew-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training\ndata points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\\% of the\ntraining data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared\nto fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other\nstate-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning.\nOur qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our\nmethod across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures."}

We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories\nof user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing\nillegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge\nhorizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated\nby the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels\nof sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users\nmay want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves\ntraining multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each\ncategory to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally\nexpensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's\ndesired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose\nrefusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal\ntoken, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then\nshow how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal\ntoken for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior.\nRefusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the\nneed of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during\ngeneration."}

We find,\nfor example, that some motions like \"follow\" (or tracking) require\nunderstanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain\nexpertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For\nexample, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating\nforward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two.\nUsing CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language\nModels (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives\nthat depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric\nprimitives that require precise estimation of trajectories.
