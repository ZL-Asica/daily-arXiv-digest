To address this gap,\nwe introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates\nbiases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10\ndemographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By\nassessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers\nsubtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our\nevaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, we identify two\nkey patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic\ngroups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward\ntraditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses\nwhile neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a\nfinetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses.
