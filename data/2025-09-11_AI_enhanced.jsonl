This inefficiency\nincurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing\nfine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their\nefficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this\nwork, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds\nderived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training\nconfigurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency\nGap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from\nthese frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks\nreveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for\nshort length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce\nthe efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning\nalgorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.\nLeveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL\napproximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of\ntoken budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our\nefficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,\nwith low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,\nREO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching\nQwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy\nloss.

To\nwhat extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their\nactions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an\nevaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and\ntheir value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a\ndataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and\neleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value\ninclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment\nmeasures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated\nvalues and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and\nmodels. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain\nvalue-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that\nleveraging reasoned explanations improves performance.
