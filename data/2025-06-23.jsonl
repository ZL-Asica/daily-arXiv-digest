While tools for\ndetecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and\neducators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of\ndetection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or\nevaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In\nthis study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those\nproduced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human\ncoders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess\nthe impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM\noutperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of\n80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1\nscore of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated\nresponses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open\nresponse question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the\ncorresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question\ntypes and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for\nfuture work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve\nLLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical\nindicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks,\nreadability scores, and response duration.

Based on\nlexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present\nin publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly\nrecognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are\nprone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by\nannotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach\nto address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability\nacross diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our\nmethod comprises three key components: influential sample identification,\nreannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit\nhate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the\nbaseline."}

Although the developers sought to redress image\ngeneration's sociopolitical dimension by introducing diversity \"corrections,\"\ntheir opaque imposition of a standard for \"diversity\" ultimately proved\ncounterproductive. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an image\ngeneration interface designed to embrace open negotiation along the\nsociopolitical dimensions of image creation. Grounded in the principles of\nagonistic pluralism (from the Greek agon, meaning struggle), our interface\nactively engages users with competing visual interpretations of their prompts.\nThrough a lab study with 29 participants, we evaluate our agonistic interface\non its ability to facilitate reflection - engagement with other perspectives\nand challenging dominant assumptions - a core principle that underpins\nagonistic contestation.

We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording.

Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model.

First, we conduct a survey of data visualization courses at top\ncolleges and universities in the United States, in order to understand the\nlandscape of data visualization courses. We find that most courses are not\ntaught by statistics and data science departments and do not focus on\nstatistical topics, especially those related to inference. Instead, most\ncourses focus on visual storytelling, aesthetic design, dashboard design, and\nother topics specialized for other disciplines. Second, we outline three\nteaching principles for incorporating statistical inference in data\nvisualization courses, and provide several examples that demonstrate how to\nfollow these principles. The dataset from our survey allows others to explore\nthe diversity of data visualization courses, and our teaching principles give\nguidance for encouraging statistical thinking when teaching data visualization."}

Experiments on synthetic\narithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the\naccuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring\norders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training\nthe encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding\naccuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality."}

We categorize existing methods based on their\nmodeling strategies and downstream tasks, and provide a comparative analysis of\nkey components, including feature representation, fusion techniques, model\narchitectures, and pretraining objectives. Additionally, we highlight the\nstrengths and limitations of each approach and discuss their suitability for\ndifferent applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of current\nchallenges and emerging trends, offering guidance for future research and\npractical deployment in real-world scenarios."}

This paper introduces the\nRe-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that revisits LLM tasks from\ncapability, skill, and knowledge perspectives, drawing on the principles of\nBloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. While CoT provides a\nworkflow-centric perspective on tasks, Re-TASK introduces a Chain-of-Learning\n(CoL) paradigm that highlights task dependencies on specific capability items,\nfurther broken down into their constituent knowledge and skill components. To\naddress CoT failures, we propose a Re-TASK prompting strategy, which\nstrengthens task-relevant capabilities through targeted knowledge injection and\nskill adaptation.

This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require\nintegrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online\nrecipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks\nusing web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI\nagents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To\noperationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task\nenvironments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic\n3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building\nupon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,\nwhich encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,\nshopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across\nphysical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain\nintelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between\nstate-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both\nchallenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and\nweb-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly\navailable at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/."}
