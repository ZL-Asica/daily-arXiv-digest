While studies have\ninvestigated why and how peer producers contribute to Wikidata, the\ninstitutional motivations and practices of these organizations are less\nunderstood. Given Wikidata's potential role in linking and supporting knowledge\ninfrastructures and open data systems, we examined why and how information\nprofessionals in memory institutions use Wikidata as part of their\norganizational workflow. Through interviews with 15 participants, we identified\nthe three archetypal roles of Wikidata users within memory institutions,\nproviders, acquirers, and mutualists, and the different types of contributions\nthat these institutions bring to Wikidata. We then explored potential\ncollaboration opportunities between memory institutions and other volunteers in\nWikidata, discussed the value of the data work conducted by these\nprofessionals, and examined how and why they track their contributions. Our\nwork contributes to the wider discussions around collaboration and data work in\nCSCW by (1) studying the motivations and practices of information\nprofessionals, their differences from those doing volunteer work, and\nopportunities for the Wikidata community to promote more collaborative efforts\nwithin memory institutions and with other volunteers and (2) drawing attention\nto the important data work done by memory institutions on Wikidata and pointing\nout opportunities to support the contributions of information professionals."}

This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve\nmapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,\nknown as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on\nprediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better\ncaptured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings\nprimarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than\nindicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties."}

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and\ngeneralization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of\nreal-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities.

Over large ranges of\ncompute, the validation loss barely improves, then abruptly decreases. Probing\nthe models' internal representations reveals that quiet features are learned\nprior to any decrease in task loss. These quiet features represent intermediate\nalgorithmic computations that do not by themselves improve the output loss.\nAblation experiments demonstrate that individual quiet features are causally\nnecessary for task performance. Our results demonstrate that substantial\nrepresentational progress can remain hidden beneath an apparently flat loss\ncurve, challenging the prevailing use of cross-entropy as a proxy for learning\nand motivating richer diagnostics for monitoring model training."}

CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference\nguarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust\nrepresentations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of\nprompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack\nsuccess rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level\nsimilarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we\nnote a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path.

Nevertheless,\nour preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still\nhighly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely\nadopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of\nglobal trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the\nearly stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of\nMDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling\n(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning\nwith content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a\nposition-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a\ncalibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial\ntokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging\nbenchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that\nPC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more\nthan 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art autoregressive models.
