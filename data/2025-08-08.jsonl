The idea is that after looking at a distant object, users either\nshift their gaze to the hand or move their hand into view-triggering the\ncreation of a scaled near-space proxy of the object and its surrounding\ncontext. The proxy remains active until the eye-hand pattern is released.

In most research focused on developing new AV control\nalgorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed\nsolely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping\nefficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of\ninteraction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework\nthat addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot\ninteraction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction\neffect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction\nability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on\nhuman drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply\nit to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts\nwith human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring\nHDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative\nmetric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how\nparticipants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,\naggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.\nThe results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the\nevaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver\nexperience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,\ndevelopers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour\nbeyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not\nonly functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a\nhuman perspective."}

A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are\nidentified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the\nfailure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH\ndemonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong\nbaselines, including standard CoT.

We define two kinds of probabilistic causal perception:\nstructural and parametrical. We showcase our framework through a series of\nexamples of modern decision flows. We also emphasize the importance of\naddressing perception in fair ML, discussing relevant fairness implications and\npossible applications."}

Currently, there are two mainstream\nreward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both\napproaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while\nmodel-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we\nintroduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately\ngenerates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based\nreward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as\ninput. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our\nexperiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also\nimproves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in\naverage accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally."}

The process iterates through these levels,\nhalting early if a convergence criterion is met: specifically, if two or more\nconsecutive levels yield the same answer, the solution from the earliest such\nlevel is output; otherwise, the process continues until all levels are\ncompleted.

We first introduce two critical\nmetrics, named the quantization ratio ($Q_r$) and quantization block size\n($Q_b$). The former measures the number of parameters quantized to\nlow-precision arithmetic normalized by the total parameter count, whereas the\nlatter defines the number of values within a block that share a scaling factor,\nakin to the block size concept introduced in the FP4 format in NVIDIA's\nBlackwell architecture. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments\nacross different models and quantization methods, we propose a unified scaling\nlaw on post-training quantization (PTQ) that can predict loss degeneration for\nvarying $Q_r$ and $Q_b$. For $Q_r$, our scaling law implies that parameter\nscaling and ratio scaling have a multiplicative relationship. Consequently,\nlarger models are more amenable to a higher quantization ratio $Q_r$, thus\nsupporting an increase in the adoption of mixed quantization for inference.\nRegarding $Q_b$, our findings indicate that a small block size, similar to that\nused in Blackwell, is not essential for large models.

We introduce QUEST (Question Utility Estimation with\nSimulated Tests), a framework that uses language models to simulate learners\nand directly quantify the utility of a question - its contribution to exam\nperformance. QUEST simulates a learner who asks questions and receives answers\nwhile studying a textbook chapter, then uses them to take an end-of-chapter\nexam. Through this simulation, the utility of each question is estimated by its\ndirect effect on exam performance, rather than inferred indirectly based on the\nunderlying content. To support this evaluation, we curate TEXTBOOK-EXAM, a\nbenchmark that aligns textbook sections with end-of-section exam questions\nacross five academic disciplines. Using QUEST, we filter for high-utility\nquestions and fine-tune question generators via rejection sampling. Experiments\nshow that questions generated by QUEST-trained models improve simulated test\nscores by over 20% compared to strong baselines that are fine-tuned using\nindirect metrics or leverage prompting methods.

In this paper, we\npropose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal\nreasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each\nquestion and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach\ninvolves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can\nbe composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the\noptimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative\nexploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using\nthe collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning\ntrajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning\nparadigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the\ntask-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an\ninternalized capability for reasoning actions planning.

Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks\nevaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this\npaper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect\nreal-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our\ncommercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,\nGemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with\ncontext engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.\nOur benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science\ntask categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common\nprompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We\nfurther investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and\ntask-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal\ndistinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,\nhighlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark\ndataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation\nfor future research of more robust and effective data science agents."}
