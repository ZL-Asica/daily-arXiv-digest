In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction\nSystem (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail\ndecision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales\nbased solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and\nrelease a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched\nwith structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime\ncategory, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a\nlarge language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its\nperformance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,\nand with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory\nknowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and\nexplanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated\nby legal experts.
