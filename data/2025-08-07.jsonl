To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and\ntext generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines."}

We introduce StepWrite, a large language\nmodel-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability\nby enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form\ntexts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into\nmanageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware\nnon-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the\ncontext-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline\nmethods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and\nconversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite\ndynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent,\nand provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical\nevaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied\nactivities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load,\nimproves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods.\nTechnical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic\ncontextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact\nchecking.

Such representations also\nhave the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems\ncapable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this\ngoal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective\nstrategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses\nthese challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically\ndesigned to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language\nmodels (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this\nend, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark\ncomprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240\nsentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this\nbenchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot\nlearning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel\ninsights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,\nthe current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when\nfine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\\% F1.\nSecond, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,\nsome lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent\nperformance.

We first propose a formal\ndefinition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of\ncorrect-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This\ngives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information\nused to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable\ntoken-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge\narises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a\ncase study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a\nclosed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode\nmore factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an\naverage relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply\nhidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to\ngenerate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers.\nThis reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs,\nwhich (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated\nanswer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain\ninaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they\nwere, we would be guaranteed to rank them first."}

This attack is detrimental as it can enable\nmalicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading\nharmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an\nattack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such\nharmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or\nwithout the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source\nand commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In\nuntargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves\nup to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy\non benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific\nharmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses\nwith minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical\nneed for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of\nLLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available."}

This impossibility is not an engineering\nlimitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information\naggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference\nprocess as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting\ntheir partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent\nmathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of\nproper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of\ntransformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the\nstrictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly\nexceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of\nunattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both\nhallucination and creativity, or imagination.\n  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the\nsemantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded\nreasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates\naccessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized\nreasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that\nhallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded\nin the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a\nprincipled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems.\nFinally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and\nrefinements of the proposed theory."}
