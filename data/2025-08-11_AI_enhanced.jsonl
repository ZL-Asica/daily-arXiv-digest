But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps\nneeded to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract\nstructure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper\nintroduces DisCIPL, a method for \"self-steering\" LMs where a Planner model\ngenerates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of\nFollower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive\nsearch procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and\nefficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g.,\nLlama-3.2-1B or Qwen3-1.7B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much\nlarger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation\ntasks. Our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo\ninference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no\nfinetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces DisCIPL, a method for self-steering language models to improve reasoning and task-specific inference through recursive search procedures.", "motivation": "To enhance reasoning capabilities in language models, particularly for complex tasks that involve searching or planning in natural language.", "method": "DisCIPL utilizes a Planner model to generate inference programs executed by a population of Follower models, allowing for recursive search procedures to guide inference.", "result": "DisCIPL matches or outperforms larger models like GPT-4o on challenging constrained generation tasks when using smaller Follower models.", "conclusion": "The approach proposed creates a new avenue for efficient and verifiable reasoning in language models, leveraging parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of self-steering LMs with recursive search capabilities", "Demonstration of efficiency improvements over larger models", "Opening a design space for Monte Carlo inference strategies"], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["self-steering LMs", "recursive search procedures", "Monte Carlo inference"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}

In\nXLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label\nprojection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the\noriginal sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word\naligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design\ndecisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been\nsystematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which\nproject labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)\ntranslation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,\nwe revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects\nof low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for\nprojecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to\nreduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of\nthe translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact\ntranslation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT\nwith WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.\nWe then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and\ntranslate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms\nthe marker-based projection.
