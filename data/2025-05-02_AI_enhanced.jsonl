We expand upon existing research by conducting\ntwo survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine\nwhether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using\nLLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into\naccount both the \"receive\" and \"accept\" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller\n1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended\ninteractions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot\ninteractions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects\n(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced\ncontent). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct\npolitical domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual\ncampaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the\nreal-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact\nconditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we\nestimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \\$48-\\$74 per persuaded voter\ncompared to \\$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the\ncosts of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional\ncampaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not\ncurrently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale\npolitical persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM\ncapabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage\nexposure to persuasive LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for political persuasion compared to traditional campaign methods through survey experiments and simulations.", "motivation": "To explore the potential threat of LLMs to democracy and their effectiveness in political persuasion.", "method": "Conducted two survey experiments with 10,417 participants and a real-world simulation exercise to compare LLM-based persuasion with traditional political campaigns, considering both exposure and acceptance of messages.", "result": "Findings indicate LLMs are similarly persuasive as campaign ads but raising concerns about exposure and scaling challenges for LLMs.", "conclusion": "LLMs show potential for political persuasion at a lower cost per persuaded voter, but traditional methods are currently easier to scale; future improvements in LLMs may alter this balance.", "key_contributions": ["Provided empirical data on LLMs' persuasive effectiveness compared to traditional methods", "Developed a framework for assessing extended human-LLM interactions", "Estimated costs of LLM-based persuasion versus traditional campaigns"], "limitations": "The study mainly focuses on cost-effectiveness and does not fully address long-term impacts on democratic processes or ethical considerations of using LLMs in political contexts.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Political Persuasion", "Survey Experiments", "Cost-Effectiveness", "Democracy"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}

Publishing incentives encourage researchers\nto present \"positive\" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal.\nConsequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results,\nespecially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician\ninterpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this\nstudy, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since\nLLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published\nmedical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board\nmore susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their\noutputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into\nplain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs\nare generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to\nmitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) are affected by 'spin' in medical research findings and how they interpret such findings compared to humans.", "motivation": "Medical research struggles with translating treatments into clinical practice due to 'spin' in published results, which influences clinician decisions.
