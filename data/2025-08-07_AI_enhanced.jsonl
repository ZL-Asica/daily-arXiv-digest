To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context.

For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "The PAIRS framework enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation by adaptively deciding when to retrieve and how to select external information, improving efficiency and accuracy.", "motivation": "Address inefficiencies in current RAG systems that retrieve unnecessary information and risk drawing irrelevant documents from sparse queries.", "method": "PAIRS uses a dual-path generation mechanism where the LLM generates both direct and context-augmented answers to determine if external retrieval is needed, followed by a dual-path retrieval process when necessary.", "result": "PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by approximately 25%, triggering for only 75% of queries while improving accuracy by +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 on average across six QA benchmarks.", "conclusion": "The PAIRS framework significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of RAG systems by streamlining the retrieval process based on context and need.", "key_contributions": ["Introduces a training-free framework for efficient information retrieval in LLMs.", "Implements a dual-path generation mechanism to determine necessity of external knowledge retrieval.", "Shows empirical improvements in efficiency and accuracy on QA benchmarks."], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "Large Language Models", "Information Retrieval"], "importance_score": 9, "read_time_minutes": 5}}

While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,\nexisting methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities\nfor effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language\ndomain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem\nunderstanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot\nidentify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to\ninterpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training\npipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by\ndistilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and\nanother by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by\nexpert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to\nfurther fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models\nexhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal\nreasoning.
