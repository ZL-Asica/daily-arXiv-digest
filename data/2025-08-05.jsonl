This paper investigates the potential\nof LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating\nFreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often\ncomplex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid\nprototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate\ninitial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed\nand refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of\nexperiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this\napproach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately\ncomplex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating\nmultiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory\nretrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance\nscript robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution\nand exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation.\nThis work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows\nwhile identifying critical areas for future development."}

Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands.

We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named\n\\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to\nany prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted\nterms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories.

We scraped Telugu texts\ncovering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites\nand web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a\ncustom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol\nfor collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated\nrationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:\nwith rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed\nplausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,\nfor six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,\nwe curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate\nfairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a\nfairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental\nresults suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,\nreduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human\nreasoning."}

As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the\nincorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on\nAI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In\nour between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of\ngeneral population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video\navatar, or interacted with a chatbot.

While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an\niterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating\noutputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy\npresented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier\nto specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt\nscaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task\ngoals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and\ncode familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt\ninteractions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code\ntraceability, and consistency in generated summaries."}

This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally."}

However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase\nin memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the\nkey-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less\nrelevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when\ncritical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{PoD}~(Proximal\ntokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that\nallocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens\nin a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our\napproach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at\nthe beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for\nnext-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly\nredundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \\textsc{PoD}\npreserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it\nshares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both\nqueries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single\nset of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without\ndiscarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training\nadaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing\nstructure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and\nreal-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \\textsc{PoD} reduces KV\ncache memory usage by up to 35\\% without compromising performance. Our method\nis orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined\nwith them for further KV cache compression."}
