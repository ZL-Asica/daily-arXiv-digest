In this\npaper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate\nthe robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically\nfaithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation --\nspanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems --\napplies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint\ninjection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while\ncertain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to\n-42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting\nsensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics.\nThese findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning\nsystems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning\nalignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and\nevaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient\nLLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the robustness of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) using adversarial prompt perturbations, revealing their sensitivity to both semantics and surface dynamics, and calls for improved approaches to reasoning alignments.", "motivation": "The study aims to understand if LLMs genuinely reason or simply exploit statistical patterns, particularly in complex tasks.", "method": "The authors introduce the Chain-of-Code Collapse framework, evaluating 700 perturbed code generations from LeetCode-style problems with various perturbations such as storytelling reframing and numerical perturbations.", "result": "Certain modifications led to accuracy drops of up to 42.1%, whereas other perturbations surprisingly increased accuracy by up to 35.3%, indicating sensitivity to prompt dynamics and semantics.", "conclusion": "The findings highlight the fragility of current LLM reasoning systems and advocate for improved robust reasoning approaches.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of the Chain-of-Code Collapse evaluation framework", "Release of perturbation datasets for further research", "Demonstration of sensitivity of LLMs to prompt dynamics and semantics"], "limitations": "The study focuses on a limited set of transformation types for prompt perturbations.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "adversarial perturbations", "reasoning robustness", "Chain-of-Thought prompting", "prompt dynamics"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}

For example, a summarization\nsystem that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead\ncustomers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in\nMDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness\nfocuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of\nsummaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose\nFairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and\ncorpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to\ngenerate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level\nfairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting\nthe weights of preference pairs.

Yet, studies show that these post-hoc\nexplanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by\nmismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this\ninconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high\ncost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small\ndatasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank\n(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and\nmodels, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature\nimportance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely\ndiffer between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the\nstandard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To\novercome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more\neffectively captures variation in explanation quality.
