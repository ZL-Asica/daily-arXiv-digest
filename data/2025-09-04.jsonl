Capturing the\ninteraction between spatial and temporal dimensions also helps explain the\nunderlying structure of the data. However, most datasets do not reveal\nattribute relationships, requiring additional algorithms to extract meaningful\npatterns. Existing visualization tools often focus either on attribute\nrelationships or spatiotemporal analysis, but rarely support both\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we present STRive (SpatioTemporal Rule\nInteractive Visual Explorer), a visual analytics system that enables users to\nuncover and explore spatial and temporal patterns in data. At the core of\nSTRive lies Association Rule Mining (ARM), which we apply to spatiotemporal\ndatasets to generate interpretable and actionable insights. We combine ARM with\nmultiple interactive mechanisms to analyze the extracted relationships.\nAssociation rules serve as interpretable guidance mechanisms for visual\nanalytics by highlighting the meaningful aspects of the data that users should\ninvestigate. Our methodology includes three key steps: rule generation, rule\nclustering, and interactive visualization. STRive offers two modes of analysis.\nThe first operates at the rule cluster level and includes four coordinated\nviews, each showing a different facet of a cluster, including its temporal and\nspatial behavior. The second mode mirrors the first but focuses on individual\nrules within a selected cluster. We evaluate the effectiveness of STRive\nthrough two case studies involving real-world datasets -- fatal vehicle\naccidents and urban crime. Results demonstrate the system's ability to support\nthe discovery and analysis of interpretable patterns in complex spatiotemporal\ncontexts."}

We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two\nidentity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a\nperson's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the\nbreadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from\nsocial-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we\ncompare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline.

Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs\nthat require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and\ntheir instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we\nadopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates\nand humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by\nintegrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.\nFurthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of\nassembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our\nbenchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification\nprocess in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,\nincluding competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great\nroom for improvement for the current models.

Our review shows that successful HAI systems are not the\nautomatic result of stronger models but the product of careful, human-centered\ndesign. By identifying key open challenges, this survey aims to give insight\ninto current and future research that turns the raw power of LFMs into\npartnerships that are reliable, trustworthy, and beneficial to society."}

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer.

With\nthe ever-increasing amount of information around us, calculating similarity\nbecomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or\nmedical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as\nsmall acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My\nresearch goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for\nsimilarities between language units in a more refined way.\n  Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging\nthe measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To\nthis end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes\nin a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions\nof the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The\nproposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the\nmodel through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of\nthe model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in\nthis thesis is called progressively refined similarity computation, which\ncombines attack testing with adversarial training. The similarity regression\nmodel of this thesis achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling edge\ncases."}

Every positive finding\nsentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes\nlabelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type,\nlocations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the\nfirst manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding\nand interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed\nlocalization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings,\nit provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from\nCXR images.

To address\nthis issue we present the Canceling Attitudes Detection (CADE) dataset, an\nannotated corpus of canceling incidents aimed at exploring the factors of\ndisagreements in evaluating people canceling attitudes on social media.\nSpecifically, we study the impact of annotators' morality in their perception\nof canceling, showing that morality is an independent axis for the explanation\nof disagreement on this phenomenon. Annotator's judgments heavily depend on the\ntype of controversial events and involved celebrities. This shows the need to\ndevelop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are\nperpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their\ndetection."}

These\nelements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -\nmotivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building\nblocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or\nconference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations\nproduces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current\nliterature.

To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that\naggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets\ncalled PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and\nCoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through\ninferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the\nperformance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the\ndevelopment and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion\ndetection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.\nWe also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics\nto ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and\nclosed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each\nconsisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results\nshow that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits\ngroup unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do\nnot. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,\nwith one ranking 6th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.\nFor transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available\non our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0.

This discovery\nraises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these\ncritical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that\nnaively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently\nremoves crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite\nits reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose\nTruthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater\nemphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative\nfeatures simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while\nretaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.\nMoreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for\nbetter calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach\nimproves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at\n50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA."}
