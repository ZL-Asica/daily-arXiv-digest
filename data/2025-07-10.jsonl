Yet,\nvirtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including\nin studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the\nnew science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to\nkawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We\nconducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer\nvoices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii \"sweet\nspots\" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only\nfor certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling\neffect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation\nof the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for\nmanipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice."}

Currently, text\nvisualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can\nconvey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_,\nwhich convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the\nunderlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits\nthe kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be\ndisplayed.\n  In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested\ndecorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout.\nSpecifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or\n_rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly\nrendered even when styled with borders and padding.\n  We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite\ncomprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages,\nwe show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are\nsubstantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by\nconventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax\ntree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage\nscenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other\ndocument-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through\ndomain-specific styling of ragged blocks."}

We conducted a mixed-methods\nevaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters\npowered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These\nagents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,\nsemi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We\nanalyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,\nand learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization\ninfluenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural\nbackgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,\nand linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and\nstrategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally\nstylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing\nmore engaging, socially responsive systems."}

This study presents a\nnovel framework using insider language to contest conspiracy theory ideology in\nclimate change denialism on Reddit. Focusing on discussions in two Reddit\ncommunities, our research investigates reactions to pro-social and\nevidence-based intervention messages for two cohorts of users: climate change\ndeniers and climate change supporters. Specifically, we combine manual and\ngenerative AI-based methods to craft intervention messages and deploy the\ninterventions as replies on Reddit posts and comments through transparently\nlabeled bot accounts. On the one hand, we find that evidence-based\ninterventions with neutral language foster positive engagement, encouraging\nopen discussions among believers of climate change denialism. On the other,\nclimate change supporters respond positively, actively participating and\npresenting additional evidence. Our study contributes valuable insights into\nthe process and challenges of automatically delivering interventions in\nconspiracy theory communities on social media, and helps inform future research\non social media interventions."}

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations."}

We expand MorphScore\n(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a\ntotal of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in\nevaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We\nthen correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five\npre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of\nthe languages in our sample.

First, most DL solutions are designed for offline\ndecoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of\nsliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational\ncomplexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data,\nwhich are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and\nenable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration,\nwe introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method.\nRAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to\nmeet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity\nduring training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further\nalleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain\nadaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of\ntarget data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient\nframework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces\ncalibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for\nbroader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation\nfor developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate\nfeedback and user learning."}

Moreover, users' ability to customize expert profiles significantly\nimproved their sense of agency, which can potentially mitigate their\nover-reliance on AI. This work contributes to the design of intelligent systems\nthat augment creativity and collaboration, and provides design implications of\nusing customizable AI-simulated personas in domains within and beyond research\nideation."}

This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500).

Second, we leverage this ability\nof LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation\ntasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI\nfeedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks.\nThird, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world\ndatasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform\nstate-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated\nby human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a\nfirst step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs."}

Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or\nlogical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities,\nmemory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in\ncode generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to\ninvestigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by\nLLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first\nbenchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains\n1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming\nproblems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the\nmethodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source\nLLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using\none-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and\ngives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset.\nTowards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code\nhallucinations and conclude our work."}

Besides,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted\nparameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In\nthis study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter\nchallenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and\nimprove the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel\nbackdoor attack algorithm from the weak-to-strong based on Feature\nAlignment-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (FAKD).

The\nteacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student\nmodel through FAKD, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that FAKD\nhas the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We\ndemonstrate the superior performance of FAKD on classification tasks across\nfour language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different\narchitectures of teacher models.

LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still\nnot capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems\nsuch as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many\nframeworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on\ntask-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples\nand pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization\ncapability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the\ncore of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the\noptimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions\nand effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming\ncapabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach\nto planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a\ngeneral-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from\nplanning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization\nproblems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to\n9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to\nmulti-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average\n83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsignificantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI\no1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements.

We approach this attribution\nproblem from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective, drawing on formal\nlanguage theory (identification in the limit) and data-driven analysis of the\nexpanding LLM ecosystem. By modeling an LLM's set of possible outputs as a\nformal language, we analyze whether finite samples of text can uniquely\npinpoint the originating model. Our results show that, under mild assumptions\nof overlapping capabilities among models, certain classes of LLMs are\nfundamentally non-identifiable from their outputs alone. We delineate four\nregimes of theoretical identifiability: (1) an infinite class of deterministic\n(discrete) LLM languages is not identifiable (Gold's classical result from\n1967); (2) an infinite class of probabilistic LLMs is also not identifiable (by\nextension of the deterministic case); (3) a finite class of deterministic LLMs\nis identifiable (consistent with Angluin's tell-tale criterion); and (4) even a\nfinite class of probabilistic LLMs can be non-identifiable (we provide a new\ncounterexample establishing this negative result). Complementing these\ntheoretical insights, we quantify the explosion in the number of plausible\nmodel origins (hypothesis space) for a given output in recent years. Even under\nconservative assumptions-each open-source model fine-tuned on at most one new\ndataset-the count of distinct candidate models doubles approximately every 0.5\nyears, and allowing multi-dataset fine-tuning combinations yields doubling\ntimes as short as 0.28 years. This combinatorial growth, alongside the\nextraordinary computational cost of brute-force likelihood attribution across\nall models and potential users, renders exhaustive attribution infeasible in\npractice."}
