Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower\nincoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not\nwidely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for\nteaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete\nspatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has\ndeveloped or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:\nWe seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both\nin isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to\ntraditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing\npencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time\nfeedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with\n$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative\nspatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated\nassessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We\nalso compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using\ndata collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took\nour VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no\nsignificant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120\nminutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes\neach), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR.\nWe observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most\nstudents reported enjoying learning in VR."}

This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space.

So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,\nDxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,\ndelineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations\nacross rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis\nsetting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic\naccuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than\nstate-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained\nanalyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,\nwith expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable\nsubstitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,\ntraditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process\nto drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and\naccurate diagnostic solution."}

The problem is typically framed as optimizing an\nLM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.\nRecently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment\nmethod that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and\nfurther improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference\ncandidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.\nHowever, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic\neffectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference\ncandidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\\times$ effectiveness\ncompared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\\times$ effectiveness for\nZephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,\nwhich divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference\ninjection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference\nfine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and\nempirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective\nalgorithm to identify the boundaries between them.

The recently\nproposed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) model offers a promising\nalternative by effectively capturing long-range dependencies through\nexponential gating and enhanced memory variants, sLSTM for modeling local\ndependencies, and mLSTM for scalable, parallelizable memory.

To test\nmodels' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel\ntask, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which\nrequires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the\npattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the\nscene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making\nit a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether\nthey understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By\nrequiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs'\nability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing\ninformation. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually\nfiltered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a\ncontrolled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong\nVLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models\nstruggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find\nthat models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also\ndeficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs\nlike GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans\nachieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary\ninformation of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring\nthat the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well\nas difficulty in counting in images.
