This study\nexplores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used\nto train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a\nspecific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI\ncooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different\nself-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial\nidentities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural\nperspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After\nthe game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the\nstrategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived\nintelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data\nrevealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic,\nas well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the\ntreatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results\nindicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a\npositive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White\nparticipants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A\nbaseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was\nused to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the\nparticipants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model\nhelps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies\nof the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as\ncognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways\nracialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI\nsystems."}

We focus on\n''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can\nrestore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full\nprompt.

Specifically, models often\ncondense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which\nalign well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the\ncontext. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the\nsequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task\nidentity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local\nbut transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',\nsuch as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more\ntemporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.\nThis two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of\njust-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt\nto new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly."}

In this paper, we introduce a method for\nsample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --\nplaced between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The\nhypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,\nvideo), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at\ninference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of\ntraining modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through\nisometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in\nsample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,\nsatellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)\nwith encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality.

Building\nlarge models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and\nefficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of\nbrain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and\ninference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation.

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios."}

Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work\nprimarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with\nlittle behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM\npersonality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of\ntrait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of\nself-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted\ninterventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.\nOur findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction\ntuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait\ncorrelations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported\ntraits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often\ndiverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers\nself-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect\non actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from\nbehavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM\npersonality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and\ninterpretability."}
