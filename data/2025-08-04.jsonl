Contemporary literature includes some works centered\non the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language\nreasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in\nsolving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a\nplethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the\nperformance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions\nin a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a\ncomparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail.

The present study addresses this question from the perspective of\nlexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical\ndiversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,\nand -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n\n= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were\nmeasured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,\ndisparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and\nSupport Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed\nsignificantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini\nand -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated\nhigher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human\nwriters' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,\nlanguage status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce\nhuman-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce\nless human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these\nresults for language pedagogy and related applications."}

Translators benefit from articulating the theory of\ntheir translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --\nto ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation\nerrors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this\npaper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of\ntheorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling\npractices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic\ncomplexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across\ninterpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --\nespecially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating\nsemiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems\nepistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity.

In this work, we introduce\nSynthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a synthetic data framework\ndesigned to generate data that resembles immediate, on-demand feedback at scale\nwithout relying on extensive, real-world student assignments. To get this type\nof data, two large language models (LLMs) operate in teacher-student roles to\nsimulate assignment completion and formative feedback, generating synthetic\npairs of student work and corresponding critiques and actionable improvements\nfrom a teacher.

There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness.
