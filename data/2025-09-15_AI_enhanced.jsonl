Retrieval is a widely\nadopted approach, including two general paradigms: Retrieval-Then-Read (RTR)\nand post-hoc retrieval. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nremarkable proficiency, prompting growing interest in AQA among researchers.\nHowever, RTR-based AQA often suffers from irrelevant knowledge and rapidly\nchanging information, even when LLMs are adopted, while post-hoc\nretrieval-based AQA struggles with comprehending long-form answers with complex\nlogic, and precisely identifying the content needing revision and preserving\nthe original intent. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic\nfact decomposition-based Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which\ndecomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic\nfacts by the instruction-tuned LLMs. Notably, the instruction-tuned LLMs are\nfine-tuned using a well-constructed dataset, generated from large scale\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs). This process involves extracting one-hop neighbors from\na given set of entities and transforming the result into coherent long-form\ntext.
