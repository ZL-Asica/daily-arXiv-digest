However, existing\nMMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting\npre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in\noutdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow\nrange of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations\nreduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal\ntasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video\nand audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text\nKnowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive\nmultimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,\nwhere each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed\ndescriptions of concepts.

Our baseline\nsystem, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000\nsentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment\nthis data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from\nmonolingual Gujarati text.

We\nevaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and\nanalyze possible reasons for this saturation.

To address this gap we conducted a user study with 16\ngame designers and developers to examine their behaviour and interaction with\ngenerative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design\nstage is preferred by all participants.

Low"], "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and\nbehavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties.\nYet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human\nwell-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine\nflourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived\nfrom thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven\nLLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient\nand sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes:\nPurposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical\nIntegrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems,\nSelf-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes\nthrough repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across\ntrials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top\npriorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses\nfurther uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing\nethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing\nperformance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human\nflourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation\nfor understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and\npotentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of\ndeveloping psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that\naccount for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI\nsystems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing\noffers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical\nalignment."}

Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating\nU.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate\nchange, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily\nbecause it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or\nliberal personas.

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

Although prior works report gains from\nmultimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and\nmodels, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest\nunimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we\ndisentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data\ncharacteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,\nincorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text\nmodels, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate\naligning strategies.

This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical.

This phenomenon is consistently observed\nacross two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1\nand Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that\nleverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning\nsteps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in\ninference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new\nbenchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning\nsteps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a\nfoundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs."}

Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker\nclaiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks\ndisproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of\ncontinuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who\nshould be talking at every point in time, and for how long? In this work we\nintroduce a computational framework for quantifying both the conversation-level\ndistribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the lower-level dynamics\nthat lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics structured\nby several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this framework to a large\ndataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time are\nperceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being preferred\nover imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less. Then we\nreveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance --\ndifferent types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by the\nparticipants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.\nFinally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of\ncomputer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI\ncommunication."}
