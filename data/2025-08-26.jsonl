Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively\nexplore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to\ninefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback\non existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex\nprompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an\nagentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate\nexploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of\nagents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An\nanalyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current\nprompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to\ndirectly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a\ngenetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving\ncandidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to\nprogressively optimize model performance.

In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system\nthat integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible,\nlanguage-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates\nthree language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language\nmodels (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and\nspatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an\nembodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance\nuser experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS)\nscore of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show\nthat the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of\nsystem intelligence.

Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from\npowerful teacher models to compact and transparent students.

Using multiple\nreasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path\nidentically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability\nacross tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative\nDistillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional\nrouting, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only\ncorrect reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional\nrouting dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning\nstate.

These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent\ncontent, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is\ntwofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the\nmost widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of\npedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second,\nalthough sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers\nlack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical\nnuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the\nuser's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established\nKnowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS)\nto act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for\ngenerating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent\nbaseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work\nsequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities\nthrough conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by\n20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the\nQuality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small,\noften statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the\nqualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture.\nTeachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD,\ndescribing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and\nclassroom-ready.

Human software\ndevelopers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more\nsalient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of\nphilosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since\npeople tend to look at more salient words more often.

These limitations hinder the ability\nto capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we\naddress these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648\nJapanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of\nlegal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references\nto legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an\nontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of\nlegal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit\nreasoning explicit and machine-readable.

In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used\nto iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by\nan advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is\nalso employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way,\nwe collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train\nour DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the\nthought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well\nas LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long\nthought, showing its effectiveness.

This allows for the creation of\ndetailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined\nprompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides\ncustomized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related\ntraits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker\nprofiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,\nmarking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition."}

To achieve\nthese goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text\nquality preservation and message embedding capacity.

The challenge lies\nin ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,\nappropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still\nmaintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development\nof tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience\nagainst malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses\non adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal\nbenefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system\nthat leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a\npolicy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming\nconventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and\ncoercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce\ntau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's\nrobustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several\nstraightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide\nsome protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,\nresearch-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial\nattacks"}

In this\nwork, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that\nexplicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before\nresponding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions,\nIntent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks,\nthereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate\nboth parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary\nmodels, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact\nagainst white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all\nevaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\\% success\nrate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly,\nour method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive\nrefusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords.\nFurthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful\nintent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively\ntransferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.

However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining. On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.

In contrast, our method enables\nlow-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.\nWe formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),\nequipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past\nexperiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or\nnon-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental\nfeedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is\nachieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent\nmodel in the deep research setting, namely \\emph{Memento}, which attains top-1\non GAIA validation ($87.88\\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\\%$ on the test set.

This\nbias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies\nreceive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden\nin children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric\nquestion-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists\nof 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric\ntopics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067\nvision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256\nanatomical regions.
