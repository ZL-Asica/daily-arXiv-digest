To address this\ngap, we introduce \\textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular\nbenchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to\nextract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a\nsubstantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the\nsimpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific\ncorrelations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly\nrobust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve\nperformance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the\nimportance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability.\nOur data, code and models will be released to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introducing NeedleInATable (NIAT), a new benchmark focusing on long-context tabular data processing for large language models (LLMs).", "motivation": "To fill the gap in existing benchmarks that overlook the complexity of processing diverse structured tables and the fine-grained perception needed for practical LLM-based applications.", "method": "A new long-context tabular benchmark (NIAT) that treats individual table cells as unique entities, requiring models to extract target cells based on their locations or lookup questions.", "result": "Assessment of various LLMs shows a significant performance gap between downstream tabular tasks and NIAT, indicating weakness in true long-context understanding of structured tables.", "conclusion": "Synthesized NIAT training data can enhance model performance on both NIAT and downstream tabular tasks, highlighting the necessity of robust capabilities in table understanding for LLMs.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of NeedleInATable (NIAT) benchmark for LLMs focused on structured tables", "Revealing performance gaps in current LLMs regarding table processing tasks", "Providing synthesized training data that improves LLM performance on tabular tasks"], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["large language models", "long-context tables", "NeedleInATable", "tabular benchmarks", "structured data"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 10}}

We conducted\ncomprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings\nreveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions\nrather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical\nbreadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4\nextracting comprehensive events.
