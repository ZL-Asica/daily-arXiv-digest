To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrAInS is an inference-time steering method for LLMs and VLMs that uses gradient-based attribution to modify activations for improved task performance without model fine-tuning.", "motivation": "Most existing inference steering methods are limited by fixed interventions and do not leverage informative gradient signals from input tokens, especially in multimodal contexts.", "method": "GrAInS utilizes contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify influential tokens, constructs steering vectors, and adjusts hidden activations in transformer layers based on token-level attribution signals.", "result": "GrAInS demonstrates significant performance improvements, including a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA, a reduction of hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench, and an 8.11% increase in alignment win rates on SPA-VL, while maintaining fluency.", "conclusion": "GrAInS offers a novel and effective method for steering LLM and VLM behavior at inference time, enabling modular and interpretable control without the need for retraining.", "key_contributions": ["Introduced GrAInS for flexible inference-time steering of multimodal models", "Demonstrated empirical superiority over fine-tuning and existing steering methods", "Provided a framework for token-level influence assessment in model responses"], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["inference-time steering", "large language models", "vision-language models", "gradient-based attribution", "token influence"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}

Here we\npresent a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an\nunbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural\ndifferences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine\ncommunicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this\noutcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of\npsychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared\nintentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of\ncommunication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible\nsocially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a\ngeneral but well-developed capacity for social cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a model demonstrating how a communication system can emerge from non-communicative behaviors in a population, driven by predictable behavior and shared psychological states, without prior communication mechanisms.", "motivation": "To address the challenge of explaining how communication systems can form without existing signals or meanings, bridging the gap between non-communicative behavior and structured communication.", "method": "The authors develop a theoretical model that illustrates the emergence of a communication system through individual behavioral differences, focusing on predictable actions and shared intentionality among individuals.", "result": "The model indicates that a communication system capable of expressing unlimited meanings can arise from non-communicative interactions, grounded in general capacities for social cognition.", "conclusion": "The findings support the idea that complex communication systems may evolve from simpler social interactions and cognitive skills, rather than from established communicative frameworks.", "key_contributions": ["Development of a model to explain the emergence of communication systems from non-communicative behaviors", "Identification of key cognitive capabilities (predictable behavior, shared psychological states) that facilitate communication formation", "Reinforcement of theories relating to social cognition and the evolution of language"], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["communication systems", "social cognition", "modeling"], "importance_score": 4, "read_time_minutes": 20}}

To facilitate\ngenuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the\ngeneration of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly\nenhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking\nstyles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic\nknowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to\nmitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions\nof hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and\nexpressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results\ndemonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\naudio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source\nand commercial solutions.
