Many existing systems, however, are a black\nbox which are not directly controllable, thus making these systems less\nflexible and adaptive to users. We present \\textit{AffectMachine-Pop}, an\nexpert system capable of generating retro-pop music according to arousal and\nvalence values, which can either be pre-determined or based on a listener's\nreal-time emotion states. To validate the efficacy of the system, we conducted\na listening study demonstrating that AffectMachine-Pop is capable of generating\naffective music at target levels of arousal and valence. The system is tailored\nfor use either as a tool for generating interactive affective music based on\nuser input, or for incorporation into biofeedback or neurofeedback systems to\nassist users with emotion self-regulation."}

Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and\neven more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of\nidentifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads\nto two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement\nhuman-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.\n  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most\nsignificant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual\nenvironment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically\nfocuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are\ndiscussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical\nvideo game that addresses the research question: \"Is it possible to distinguish\nhuman players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?\" A\nmachine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural\nnetwork is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create\nhuman-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for\ndistinguishing humans from AI-driven players."}

To\naddress this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal\ndecomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for\nretraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer\ndepends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as\nunified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract\nthe most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or\ndisrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes\nunnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of\nPCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,\nto mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward\nnetwork (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct\nthe residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices.

However,\nit remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn\nrule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse\ntasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based\nReasoning, a.k.a.

This clustering results in a distributional\ninconsistency between the embeddings of short and long texts. We further\ninvestigate how these differences contribute to the performance decline\nobserved with longer texts across various downstream tasks. Through a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism, which acts as a low-pass\nfilter in PLM-based models, we demonstrate that as text length increases, the\nstrength of low-pass filtering intensifies, causing embeddings to retain more\nlow-frequency components. As a result, input token features become more\nsimilar, leading to clustering and ultimately the collapse of embeddings for\nlonger texts. To address this issue, we propose a simple method, TempScale,\nwhich mitigates the Length Collapse phenomenon. By narrowing the gap in\nlow-pass filtering rates between long and short texts, TempScale ensures more\nconsistent embeddings across different text lengths. This approach leads to\nperformance improvements of 0.94% on MTEB and 1.10% on LongEmbed, which focuses\nspecifically on long-context retrieval, providing strong evidence for the\nvalidity of our analysis.

However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations\nthat are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios\noften diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to\ngenerate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value\nPortrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value\norientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of\nitems that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of\nassessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human\nsubjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations\nbetween these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This\npsychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with\nspecific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through\nevaluating 44 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize\nBenevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on\nTradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in\nhow LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data."}

After initial skepticism and\nbans, many schools have chosen to embrace this new technology by integrating it\ninto their curricula in the form of virtual tutors and teaching assistants.\nHowever, neither the companies developing this technology nor the public\ninstitutions involved in its implementation have set up a formal system to\ncollect feedback from the stakeholders impacted by them. In this paper, we\nargue that understanding the perceptions of those directly or indirectly\nimpacted by LLMs in the classroom, including parents and school staff, is\nessential for ensuring responsible use of AI in this critical domain.\n  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose the Contextualized\nPerceptions for the Adoption of LLMs in Education (Co-PALE) framework, which\ncan be used to systematically elicit perceptions and inform whether and how\nLLM-based tools should be designed, developed, and deployed in the classroom.\nSecond, we explain how our framework can be used to ground specific rubrics for\neliciting perceptions of the relevant stakeholders in view of specific goals\nand context of implementation. Overall, Co-PALE is a practical step toward\nhelping educational agents, policymakers, researchers, and technologists ensure\nthe responsible and effective deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse\nlearning contexts."}
