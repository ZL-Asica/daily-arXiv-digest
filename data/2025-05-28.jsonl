However,\nvery few works have fundamentally changed the generation pattern: each token\nneeds one forward pass and one KV cache. This can be sub-optimal because we\nfound that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of\ninformation that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated\nconfidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce\nHAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource\nallocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token\nduring inference. Stacking a compositional embedder and a micro-step decoder in\nbetween a base LLM, HAMburger smashes multiple tokens into a single KV and\ngenerates several tokens per step. Additionally, HAMburger functions as a\nspeculative decoding framework where it can blindly trust self-drafted tokens.\nAs a result, HAMburger shifts the growth of KV cache and forward FLOPs from\nlinear to sub-linear with respect to output length, and adjusts its inference\nspeed based on query perplexity and output structure. Extensive evaluations\nshow that HAMburger reduces the KV cache computation by up to 2$\\times$ and\nachieves up to 2$\\times$ TPS, while maintaining quality in both short- and\nlong-context tasks.

In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for\na specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient\ncontextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.\nHowever, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of\nselecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant\nschema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM\nunderstand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the\ngo-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods\nintroduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.\n  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,\nhigh-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL\ngeneration, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such\nscenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the\nintricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution\nlatencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on\nsimilarity.

We formulate this process as a probabilistic\nmodel and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which\niteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths.

In this paper, we propose a\nframework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1)\nexplicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn\ndialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these\nmodalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset\npairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions\nfrom the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe\nvalue expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed\nvalues in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education\nlevel, but consistency varies.

In this work, we\npropose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects\nlanguage neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related\nneurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the\ndistributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the\nLLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1)\nmultilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3)\nmultilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting.\nAdditionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment\nwith a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of\n''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a\ncomprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing\nempirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual\nalignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs."}

In the\npre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP)\ntask, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a\nlarge number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and\nreasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream\ntasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning\n(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine\nagent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting\nwith a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and\nfollowed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the\ntraining framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer\nrewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning\napproach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more\nchallenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop\nquestion answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nMaskSearch significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on\nboth in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks."}

To\nsemantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the\nability to \"imagine\" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would\nlook with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We\nuse this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic\nvisual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with\nminimal human effort.

In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make\nunlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish\na connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM)\nthrough a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial\ntraining designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM\nreveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating\nrelearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to\nenhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,\nincluding WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization\napproaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning\nattacks.

To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight\nalignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at\nthe start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the\nrest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while\nmaintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful\nresponses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than\nDirect Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot\nvariant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive\nanalysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to\nreasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer\nAI."}
