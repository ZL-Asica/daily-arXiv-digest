This knowledge\ncan be effective when recommending commercial products and services, and also,\nwhen improving advertisement design. Therefore, analysis and visualization of\neye gaze have been an active research topic. This paper proposes a new method\nfor visualizing patterns of the gaze trajectories of multiple people by (1)\nvisualizing patterns that move through multiple areas of interest (AOI) and (2)\nvisualizing differences among multiple gaze trajectories. The method first\nconstructs a hierarchical AOI structure to a Web page or an image, and uses\nthis structure to convert the trajectory into a sequence of symbols. We apply\nN-grams to the generated symbol sequences to extract transition patterns\nbetween AOIs. Finally, the method visualizes a list of the pattern extraction\nresults and the shapes of the characteristic elements. We present the\nvisualization of gaze trajectories for three examples of stimuli, and argue\nthat analysts can efficiently discover trends in gaze transitions between text\nand figures, as well as differences between participants of the eye-tracking\nexperiments."}

Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice\nquestions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance\ndrops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as\nGPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative\nperformance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable.\nMoreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context\ncan substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much\nas a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to\ndesign, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs."}

For the analysis, we first\ncollect two complementary datasets: (1) aggregated interaction data for all\nFacebook posts (public + private) for 19,050 manually labeled news articles\n(225.3M user interactions), and (2) a subset containing only interactions with\npublic posts (70.4M interactions).

Building\nupon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human\nevaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM\nperformance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of\nhallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define\nhallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case\nmaterials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating\narguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method\nemploys an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and\ncompares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case\ntriples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct\nLLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply\nargument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3)\nrecognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared\nfactors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve\nhigh accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument\ngeneration tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of\nrelevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test\n3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating\nspurious arguments despite the lack of common factors.

Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ\nGPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human\nverification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing\nannotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm\ndataset using a collaborative gating architecture.

We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances\nprobabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and\nevaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual\nspecification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we\nsystematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into\nthe cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to\ngenerating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can\nmatch or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in\npredicting human answer patterns.

The MVAN model\nincludes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which\nensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet\ncontent and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in\nthe model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in\nthe propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets,\nand the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods by 2.5\\% in accuracy on average, and produce a\nreasonable explanation."}

For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic\nlexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to\nlearn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and\ndocuments. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using\nidentifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead.

This problem has\nbroad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data\nselection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is\nthat not all auxiliary tasks are beneficial in improving the performance of the\ntarget task. Thus, selecting the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial.\nConventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise\nselection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated\ntraining on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm\nfor estimating model fine-tuning performance without requiring repeated\ntraining. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using data from all\ntasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model\nfine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the\nmeta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based\napproximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs.\nThus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few\nseconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model once on the selected\nsubset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach,\ndelivering a speedup of $30\\times$ over conventional subset selection while\nincurring only $1\\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances.

In\nthis paper, we leverage the encoding-decoding framework to study how\ntransformers form task vectors during pretraining and how their task encoding\nquality predicts ICL task performance. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the\ntraining dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of\ntask encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent\ntasks (e.g., \"Finding the first noun in a sentence.\") into distinct, separable\nrepresentations, it concurrently builds conditional decoding algorithms and\nimproves its ICL performance. We validate this phenomenon across pretrained\nmodels of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B) and over the\ncourse of pretraining in OLMo-7B. Further, we demonstrate that the quality of\ntask encoding inferred from representations predicts ICL performance, and that,\nsurprisingly, finetuning the earlier layers can improve the task encoding and\nperformance more than finetuning the latter layers. Our empirical insights shed\nlight into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language\nmodels via their representations."}

On one\nhand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by\ncomplex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual\ndata, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this\nwork, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs,\nGCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream\ntask into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of\nprompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt\nlearning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism\ndiffers significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a\nprompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based\ninference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a\n``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step.\nConditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on\nthe current state.

By utilizing this space, we\ncan analyze the impact of task type settings, used as prompts, on data quality.\nAdditionally, this space can be used to construct multi-stage subsets of\nvarying quality to facilitate curriculum learning.

However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats\nsuch as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This\nsimilarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text,\nleading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence\nCuration (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval\nto reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents\nand then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence\ncuration process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically\ngenerates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our\napproach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin)\nquestion answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595\nquestion-answer pairs.

Although classical\narchitectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it\nis not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding\noperations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a\nTransformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where\nvariables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each\nprogram requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep\nto find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments\nacting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with\nthree distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical\nconstants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and\n(3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment\nchains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit\nthe residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention\nheads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the\nmodel to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in\naccurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to\nimplement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support,\nbridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student\ndistillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned\nto produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between\nYOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans.

Central to this personalization is\npreference optimization: the system's ability to detect, interpret, and align\nwith individual user preferences.
