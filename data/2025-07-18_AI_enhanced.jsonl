In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior.

Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to enhance the length generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) by imitating Turing Machine processes, significantly improving performance on reasoning tasks.", "motivation": "To address the challenge of length generalization in Transformer-based LLMs, which struggle with longer sequences than those observed during training.", "method": "TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thought data that imitates the execution of a Turing Machine by expanding reasoning steps into atomic states and employing explicit memory fetch mechanisms.", "result": "TAIL improves the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks, surpassing previous methods and demonstrating significant length generalization capabilities using synthetic data.", "conclusion": "This work highlights the importance of Turing Machine concepts for enhancing LLM reasoning, and provides a promising direction for future research in synthetic data learning.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL)", "Demonstration of improved length generalization in LLMs", "Creation of a synthetic dataset covering various algorithms and tasks"], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["Turing Machine", "Length Generalization", "Imitation Learning"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}
