Personalizing pretrained models via calibration--collecting\nlabeled data from each user--can improve performance but introduces user\nfriction and struggles with limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose\na calibrationless longitudinal personalization method: a contextual multi-arm\nbandit (MAB) algorithm combined with a pretrained neural network for gesture\nrecognition. This reinforcement-learning-style approach enables personalization\nusing binary reward signals, either user-provided or inferred by the system.\n  We validated this method in a user study.

This paper investigates how the appearance\nof AI assistance affects our perceptions of message senders. Adding nuance to\nprevious research, through two studies (N=399) featuring vignette scenarios, we\nfind that AI-assistance labels don't necessarily make people view senders\nnegatively. Rather, they dampen the strength of character signals in\ncommunication. We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message\n(like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize\nthe sender as warm. At the same time, when someone sends a coldness-signalling\nmessage (like bragging or blaming) without assistance, people more confidently\ncategorize them as cold. Interestingly, AI labels weaken both these\nassociations: An AI-assisted apology makes the sender appear less warm than if\nthey had written it themselves, and an AI-assisted blame makes the sender\nappear less cold than if they had composed it independently. This supports our\nsignal diagnosticity explanation: messages labeled as AI-assisted are viewed as\nless diagnostic than messages which seem unassisted.

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal.

This paper introduces a precise\ndefinition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,\nestablishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond\nconventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their\nrecognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for\njurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's\nkey digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal\ninstruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and\nthe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data\nbreaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational\nincidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also\nexamines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI\nincident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted\npolicy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into\nIndia's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting\nfor high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal\nagency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting\nframeworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and\nstrengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint\nfor other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral\nframeworks."}

In this study, we\ninvestigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in\nresume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or\nmisleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines\ndense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to\nimprove both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that\nevaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data\nstratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:\nlow, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables\na fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful\nsubspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG\nintegration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT\nmodels augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR\nregion, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings\nhighlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also\nthe importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model\nbehavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by\nglobal metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human\nResources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and\ncontextual matching are essential."}

In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose\nEntropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the\nlearning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG\namplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,\nand attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration.

This paper aims to analyze and improve\nthe performance of multiple tasks by facilitating the transfer of knowledge\nbetween their corresponding prompts in a multi-task setting. Our proposed\napproach decomposes the prompt for each target task into a combination of\nshared prompts (source prompts) and a task-specific prompt (private prompt).\nDuring training, the source prompts undergo fine-tuning and are integrated with\nthe private prompt to drive the target prompt for each task. We present and\ncompare multiple methods for combining source prompts to construct the target\nprompt, analyzing the roles of both source and private prompts within each\nmethod. We investigate their contributions to task performance and offer\nflexible, adjustable configurations based on these insights to optimize\nperformance. Our empirical findings clearly showcase improvements in accuracy\nand robustness compared to the conventional practice of prompt tuning and\nrelated works.
