However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks\nbecoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth\ndemands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian\nvisions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable,\nperception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive\nDissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty\nrather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to\nnavigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths.\nBy delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances\nreflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability\nin complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of\nthe approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in\ndomains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical\nconcerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive\nmanipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt\nrather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of\nAI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the\nmind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing\nHuxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI\nechoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend\npassive cognition through active epistemic struggle."}

However, few studies have examined\ntheir impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.\nHere, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images\n(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal\nimages and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of\ndifficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human\nrating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the\nmessage. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via\nNatural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to\nunderstand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not\ndiffer in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,\nwhile they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem\nto generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced\nexperience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of\nvisual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future\nresearch and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when\nshaping environmental communication."}

Although many existing studies leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding\ncapabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in\nthe running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced\nlabeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.\nData augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual\ninformation, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but\nfaces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this\npaper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data\naugmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training\ndata based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training\ndata with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA\nmodel.

Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing\ninformation barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and\npotentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent\nupon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction\nprinciples, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and\nclearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways\nemphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM\nsystems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes\nempirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the\nresponsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction\necosystem."}

This single-word perturbation vulnerability represents a\nsignificant weakness in classifiers, which malicious users can exploit to\nefficiently create a multitude of adversarial examples. This paper studies this\nproblem and makes the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a novel\nmetric $\\rho$ to quantitatively assess a classifier's robustness against\nsingle-word perturbation. (2) We present the SP-Attack, designed to exploit the\nsingle-word perturbation vulnerability, achieving a higher attack success rate,\nbetter preserving sentence meaning, while reducing computation costs compared\nto state-of-the-art adversarial methods.

However, the task remains challenging, particularly in\nunseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution\noutputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they\nencapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse\ncorpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize\nthese outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the\nproblems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics\nacross tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and\nshould be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity\nAttention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM\nand positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from\nthe next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot,\nour method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token\ndistribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource\nrequirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance\nin-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction\nof their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen\ndomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary\nacross distribution shifts.

First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop\nprincipled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."}

While multi-modal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization\nremains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader\nmathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ\ntests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising\nassessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a\ncomprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks\nacross 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our\nevaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance\nvariations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but\nalso uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors\nby showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,\ndisplaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula\nderivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench\nempirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit\ndeficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant\nlacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available."}
