In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a\nscalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built\non state space modeling.

Previous studies\nhave reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained\nmodels in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in\nspecific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token\nprediction loss.

To address this\ngap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods\nat varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse\ncollection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural\nlanguage while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our\nexperiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis\nreveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are\npreferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while\nstatistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than\nprefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear\nstrategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of\nsparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even\nmoderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on\nat least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal\nsolution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored\nfor sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold\ntrue beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate\nthat sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer\nLLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of\ntrade-offs for performance-sensitive applications."}

This survey paper presents a desideratum for\nnext-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges\npersist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach\nhuman-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven\nConversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary\ndimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human\nintelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness\nand user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool\nutilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel\ntaxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our\nproposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key\ndirections, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning\nskills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task\ncompletion, personalization, and proactivity.

In this work, we introduce a\ntheoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting\nhallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the\nclassical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent\nadaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate\nwhether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language\n$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can\nreliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute\nhallucinations.\n  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the\nclassical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination\ndetection method can be converted into a language identification method, and\nconversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for\nhallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language\nidentification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally\nimpossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only\ncorrect examples from the target language.\n  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the\ndetector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples\n(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this\nconclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination\ndetection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\n  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in\ntraining hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for\nfeedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment."}

Recent advances in Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and\nvideo understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise\ntemporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.\nHowever, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption\ngeneration, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some\ntraditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to\ncapture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the\nabove issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for\nSingle-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.\nTimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,\nenabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long\nvideo understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a\ntraining-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects\nrepresentative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates\ncomplementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle\nlong temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer\nachieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end\nform, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and\nstrong semantic relevance."}

To address\nthis, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant\nInference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs\nresource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM\nknowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights\non knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct\nhierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different\nlevels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we\nestablish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various\ntenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage\nincreases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on\nfrequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through\nparameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance\nresource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained\npipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O\noperations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with\nbatched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a\nsingle GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy."}
