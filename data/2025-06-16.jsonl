Prior work in CSCW has shown that\nmoderators often struggle to follow multiple simultaneous discussions, track\nevolving conversations, and maintain contextual understanding--all of which\nhinder timely and effective moderation. While platforms like Reddit use\nthreaded structures to organize discourse, deeply nested threads can still\nobscure discussions and make it difficult to grasp the overall trajectory of\nconversations. In this paper, we present an interactive system called Needle to\nsupport better navigation and comprehension of complex discourse within\nthreaded discussions. Needle uses visual analytics to summarize key\nconversational metrics--such as activity, toxicity levels, and voting\ntrends--over time, offering both high-level insights and detailed breakdowns of\ndiscussion threads. Through a user study with ten Reddit moderators, we find\nthat Needle supports moderation by reducing cognitive load in making sense of\nlarge discussion, helping prioritize areas that need attention, and providing\ndecision-making supports. Based on our findings, we provide a set of design\nguidelines to inform future visualization-driven moderation tools and\nsociotechnical systems.

Through a systematic review, this\npaper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI\nprototypes.

In this\npaper, we review research on multimodal natural interaction for wearable XR,\nfocusing on papers published between 2022 and 2024 in six top venues: ACM CHI,\nUIST, IMWUT (Ubicomp), IEEE VR, ISMAR, and TVCG. We classify and analyze these\nstudies based on application scenarios, operation types, and interaction\nmodalities. This analysis provides a structured framework for understanding how\nresearchers are designing advanced natural interaction techniques in XR.

We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our\nwork offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in\ndeep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an\nestablished theory of psychological similarity."}

We design an adversarial document generation\nmethod based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection\ntechniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback\nmechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream\nlarge language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance\nmodel biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense\nmechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals\nthat poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and\nclarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This\nnovel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness\nissues of the RAG system."}

Querying\napproaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,\nand without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face\nsignificant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.\nConstructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these\ndimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a\nmulti-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the\nmulti-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space\nensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces\nsearch space through a class-based query mechanism."}

Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from\nthe cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and\nintroduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the\n1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five\nfundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152\nstrategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next\naction as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that\nleverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current\nsurgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected\nsurgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the\nbroader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art\nMLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,\nStep-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction\nperformance."}

Take the phrase \"ribonucleic\nacid\" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,\nartificial text fragments (\"rib\", \"on\", ...), then learn each token\nsequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic\nentity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding\nand, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we\nintroduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method\nthat redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences\nthat span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.\nOur experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional\nnext-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional\napplications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo\nprotein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the\nprohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first\nto bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively\ndemocratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and\nresearchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method\nsuggests wider implications for the machine learning research community.

Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning\nmodels do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is\nby training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to\neffectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as\ngeneration, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses\nbefore it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify\nthree key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the\nbase LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with\ngeneration (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging\n\"negative\" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,\nresulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)\ncoupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a\nspecifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our\nrecipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25\nscores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget.
