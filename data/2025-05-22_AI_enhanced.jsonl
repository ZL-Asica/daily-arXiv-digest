Language models have to parse through\nmultiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence\npieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more\ncomplex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on\nentailment and the generative ability of language models to produce\n''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a\nclaim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved\nsuperior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different\nprompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the\nliterature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw\nevidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the\nbest performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training\nlanguage models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered\nan improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same\ndataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)\noutperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for\nLIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively).

DCoLT treats each intermediate step in\nthe reverse diffusion process as a latent \"thinking\" action and optimizes the\nentire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the\nfinal answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process,\nDCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on\ngrammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement\nDCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose\nSEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its\nconcrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over\nthe entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the\ndiscrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order\nto predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action\nresulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the\nPlackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show\nthat using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform\nother DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both.
