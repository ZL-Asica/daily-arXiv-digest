To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline\nthat combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement\nthrough iterative reinforcement learning.

These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost\nand latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive\nperformance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another\ncritical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due\nto inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we\nprobe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before\nand after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly,\nthese bias effects are complex and unpredictable.

In this work, we present the first study to analyze how\nLLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their\ninternal representations when processing known and unknown questions in\nmultiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs'\nperceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper\nlayers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge\nboundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of\na training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary\nperception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk\nin low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair\ntranslation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across\nlanguages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge\nboundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising\nthree representative types of knowledge boundary data.
