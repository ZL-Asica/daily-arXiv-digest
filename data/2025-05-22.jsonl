Semantically-resonant patterns are those that intuitively evoke the\nconcept they represent within a specific set (e.g., in a vegetable concept set,\nsmall dots for olives and large dots for tomatoes), analogous to the concept of\nsemantically-resonant colors (e.g., using olive green for olives and red for\ntomatoes). Previous research has shown that semantically-resonant colors can\nimprove chart reading speed, and designers have made attempts to integrate\nsemantic cues into abstract pattern designs. However, a systematic framework\nfor developing such patterns was lacking. To bridge this gap, we conducted a\nseries of workshops with design experts, resulting in a design methodology that\nsummarizes the methodology for designing semantically-resonant abstract\npatterns. We evaluated our design methodology through another series of\nworkshops with non-design participants.

Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including\nthe previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional\nfeatures of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised\ncontent may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an\naugmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which\nsupplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM\nto reduce the negativity of their original sentiment.

This raises an important\nresearch question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs\nthrough Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an\nunexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1\nfails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify\nthree key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that\nexplicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can\nlead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and\ncomplex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we\nfind that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain\ncomparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn\nthan more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection\non the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math\nreasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and\nover-refusal.

Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff.

In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a\nsecure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.\nFirst, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject\nGaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end\npropagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies\nto achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV\ncache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs\neffectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points\nfor input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware\nlimitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show\nthat FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and\nachieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of\nprivacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the\neffectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability."}

We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing\n$c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about\n$1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable\nto efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the\ncost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when\ntraining a transformer model on long sequences."}

Previous works studied if LLMs\nlearned the same features, which are internal representations that activate on\nspecific concepts. Since comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to\npolysemanticity, in which LLM neurons often correspond to multiple unrelated\nfeatures rather than to distinct concepts, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been\nemployed to disentangle LLM neurons into SAE features corresponding to distinct\nconcepts.

Integrated with DistilBERT for Q, K,\nand V projections, our accelerator achieves an unequivocal 7x speedup over ARM\nCPU implementations (PyTorch) and an extraordinary 200x improvement over naive\nNumPy, reaching a throughput of up to 3.1~GFLOPs for matrix multiplications on\n(64,768) x (768,3072) matrices while operating at a conservative 100 MHz. These\nresults decisively demonstrate the transformative potential of FPGA-based\nacceleration for critical Transformer operations, paving the way for scalable\nand energy-efficient deep learning inference on edge devices."}

Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph\nlearning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from\nplain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by\nintegrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention\nmechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for\nTransformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work\ndemonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph\nlearner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and\neasy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to\nconstruct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$\nattention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive\nroot-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3)\na simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its\ntheoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on\nthe empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more\ncomplicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its\noutstanding empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies\nthe practical effectiveness of PPGT."}

In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning\nand identify a central but underexplored problem: \\textit{Reasoning\nMisalignment}-the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and\nthe evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we\npropose \\textsc{AlignRAG}, a novel iterative framework grounded in\nCritique-Driven Alignment (CDA). At the heart of \\textsc{AlignRAG} lies a\n\\textit{contrastive critique synthesis} mechanism that generates\nretrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains\na dedicated retrieval-augmented \\textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} using\nlabeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned\nreasoning. Alignment signals for supervision are obtained through\nself-supervised or externally guided labeling strategies. The resulting CLM is\nexplicitly optimized for evidence sensitivity, enabling it to detect and revise\nreasoning errors during inference without relying solely on self-generated\nfeedback.

Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit\nof using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate\nreasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This\nmotivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the\ninput. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning\npaths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT\nparadigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive\nand efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by\nmerging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second,\nwe apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable\nreasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within\neach style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method\n(Ada-R1) significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline\napproaches, while maintaining performance. Notably, on five mathematical\ndatasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%,\nhighlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning\nefficiency in large language models.
