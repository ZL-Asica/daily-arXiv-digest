However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate\nplausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of\nspeech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with\nlong-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time.\nFrom these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model\nfamily to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of\nread or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text\nintermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence\nmodeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and\nefficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the\nutterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative,\nespecially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long,\na benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged\nmetrics; and quality measurements over length and time.
