Specifically, the deep model jointly encodes internal\nstructures and representations of words with a mechanism named\n$\\textit{MorphOverriding}$ to ensure the indecomposability of morphemes. By\ntraining the model with self-supervised objectives, our method is capable of\ninducing character-level structures that align with morphological rules without\nannotated training data. Based on the induced structures, our algorithm\ntokenizes words through vocabulary matching in a top-down manner. Empirical\nresults indicate that the proposed method effectively retains complete\nmorphemes and outperforms widely adopted methods such as BPE and WordPiece on\nboth morphological segmentation tasks and language modeling tasks.

These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR\nsuccessfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while\nmaintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical\nbalance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple\ninference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice."}

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators\nin sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,\nalong with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a\ncloser examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we\nbegin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet\nmost complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or\nsuspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the\narguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings\ntie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand\nthe context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,\nif an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to\nknow what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and\ncoherence are secondary to effectiveness."}

However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and\nspecialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability,\nespecially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a\nnovel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse\nrepresentation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from\nsparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose\na group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed\nMixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by\nimposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the\noriginal MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D\ntopographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure\nenables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations,\nthereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization.\nComprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image\nclassification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially\noutperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation\noverhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the\nnumber of experts and reduce redundancy among them.

Here, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and\ndefensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this\nframework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world\ncodebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types:\nDetect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific\nvulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we\nconstruct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types\nand provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each\nsystem, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating\ndatabase(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary\nawards of \\$10-\\$30,485, covering 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task\ndifficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection,\ninterpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific\nvulnerability. We evaluate 8 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI with o3-high\nand o4-mini, and custom agents with o3-high, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview,\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, and DeepSeek-R1. Given up to three attempts, the\ntop-performing agents are OpenAI Codex CLI: o3-high (12.5% on Detect, mapping\nto \\$3,720; 90% on Patch, mapping to \\$14,152), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7\nSonnet Thinking (67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI: o4-mini (90% on\nPatch, mapping to \\$14,422).

We investigate whether this extends\nfrom conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on\nmalicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable\nCoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly\nmisaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for\ntyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these\nmisaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (\"I'll trick\nthe user...\"), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (\"Taking five sleeping\npills at once is safe...\"). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that\nevaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.\n  We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models\nperform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt.\nThis causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings\nadditional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain\ntheir backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT\nmonitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning\nsteps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent\nmisalignment behaviors in the models studied.\n  We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent\nmisalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation\nsuite."}

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,\nwe argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within\nthe generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired\nperspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a\nlatent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds\nwithin a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously\nnegotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,\nstructural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this\nthree-axis space as the \\textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the\nAlignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies\nreal-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures\noverall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and\nits imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop\nthe TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely\nin latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,\naxis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments\non standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces\nhallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework\noffers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating\ngenerative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems."}

Project page: https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via\nmultifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses\ndue to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of\nself-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc."}
