There are many issues with these forms: they\nare too long, too complex and demand the user's attention too frequently. Many\nusers consent without reading so do not know what they are agreeing to. As\nsuch,granted consent is effectively uninformed. In this paper, we report on two\nstudies we carried out to arrive at a value-driven approach to inform efforts\nto reduce the length of consent forms. The first study interviewed unemployed\nusers to identify the values they want these forms to satisfy. The second\nsurvey study helped us to quantify the values and value creators. To ensure\nthat we understood the particular valuation of the unemployed, we compared\ntheir responses to those of an employed demographic and observed no significant\ndifferences between their prioritisation on any of the values. However, we did\nfind substantial differences between values and value creators, with effort\nminimisation being most valued by our participants."}

We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from\nconsumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition\nargumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both\ngeneral manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals\nthree key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative\nwhen explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in\napproximately 84\\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to\nbe ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently\ndefault to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and\nfear enhancement.

And what new risks arise as users develop emotional ties to\nnon-human agents? This study investigates how people interact with AI\ncompanions, especially simulated partners on Character.AI, and how this use is\nassociated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from\n1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244\nparticipants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction,\ninteraction intensity, and self-disclosure.

Findings suggest that people with smaller\nsocial networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that\ncompanionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower\nwell-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage\nin higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support.

This constraint\nnaturally leads to the following problem: How can we decide based on the\npresent query and model, what among a virtually unbounded set of known data\nmatters for inference? To minimize model uncertainty for a particular query at\ntest-time, we introduce Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a retrieval\nmethod that uses gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of\ndocuments for answer generation.

While existing research has addressed\nprivacy and security concerns, the specific compliance risks faced by\nhighly-skilled knowledge workers when using the LLMs, and their mitigation\nstrategies, remain underexplored. As understanding these risks and strategies\nis crucial for the development of industry-specific compliant LLM mechanisms,\nthis research conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 knowledge workers\nfrom knowledge-intensive industries to understand their practices and\nexperiences when integrating LLMs into their workflows. Our research explored\nhow these workers ensure compliance and the resources and challenges they\nencounter when minimizing risks. Our preliminary findings showed that knowledge\nworkers were concerned about the leakage of sensitive information and took\nproactive measures such as distorting input data and limiting prompt details to\nmitigate such risks. Their ability to identify and mitigate risks, however, was\nsignificantly hampered by a lack of LLM-specific compliance guidance and\ntraining.

However, the\nprocess of integrating and subsequently using models in urban digital twins is\nan inherently complex undertaking. It raises questions about how to represent\nurban complexity, how to deal with uncertain assUrban Model Platformtions and\nmodeling paradigms, and how to capture underlying power relations.

However, unlike\nmany new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the\ngeneral/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for\nevaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To\naddress this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly\nevaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined\nuser personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to\ninfer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback\ndecouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the\nmodel's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas.\nPersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are\ncategorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual\ncomplexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle\ndifferences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive\nevaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that\neven state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks\ncould fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human\nevaluators may find the distinctions challenging.

Repeating a\nnew word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for\nadults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to\nsystematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the\nlocation of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various\ncomponents for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.\nWhile some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the\nbrain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition\nremain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive\nmodel of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling\nthe task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable,\nallowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and\nmake comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make\nfirst steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to\nsimulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the\nmodels for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating\nbrain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons\nfrom the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech\nerrors in the \"patient\" model.

CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

Moreover, our\nanalysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned\nmodels maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from\nnon-reflective contexts.

By manipulating this vector, we enable\nbidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and\nfine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that\nenhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\\%, while\nsuppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to\nnavigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without\nrequiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of\nself-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding\nmodel internals can enable precise behavioral control."}

Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial\ntraining and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but\nthese methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant\ncomputational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose\nSecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against\njailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we\ntrain a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input\nprompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of\nadversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is\npassed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true\nintention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience\nby leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's\npotentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails\nof the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only\na negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense\nmethods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend\nagainst malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible\ncompute and latency overhead.

Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric.

They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for\ntyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these\nmisaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick\nthe user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five\nsleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors\nthat evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.\n  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad\nbehaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt.

In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is\nthat language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead\nof true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of\nknowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of\nco-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer\nmodel and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple\nquestion answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower\nlayers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these\nobservations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual\nassociations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit\nrather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual\nassociations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the\ngeneralization of newly learned knowledge.

Previous literature has examined bias across many\napplications and contexts, but less work has focused specifically on bias in\ngenerative LLMs' responses to subjective annotation tasks. This bias could\nresult in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority\ngroups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how\nLLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four\nannotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show systematic\nsubstantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Rather,\nwe find that multiple LLMs tend to be biased in the same directions on the same\ndemographic categories within the same datasets. Moreover, the disagreement\nbetween human annotators on the labeling task -- a measure of item difficulty\n-- is far more predictive of LLM agreement with human annotators. We conclude\nwith a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners using\nLLMs for automated data annotation tasks.

Based on this, we\ncollected 166.8k preference data, including dual-preference (helpfulness and\nharmlessness decoupled) and single-preference data (trade-off the helpfulness\nand harmlessness from scratch), respectively. Using the large-scale annotation\ndata, we further train severity-sensitive moderation for the risk control of\nLLMs and safety-centric RLHF algorithms for the safety alignment of LLMs. We\nbelieve this dataset will be a valuable resource for the community, aiding in\nthe safe deployment of LLMs. Data is available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF."}

Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our\nbenchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We\nfurther propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a\nshadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations\nacross multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a\npreviously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs."}

In this work, we\nchallenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic\nframework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a\ntext-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal\ntoolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which\nare readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a\nproblem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and\nutilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.\nOur results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial\nimprovements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and\nLongVideoBench, respectively.

Supervised detection relies on large,\ncurated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for\nzero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit\nsome task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we\nshow that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and\nsignificantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing\nthe model's response with the phrase \"Let's examine the style and the synthesis\nartifacts\" -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1 scores by\n8%-29%. These gains are consistent for two widely used open-source models and\nacross three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects, and\nanimals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating strong\ngeneralization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional model\nsizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations -- suggesting\nrobustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a behavior\npreviously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers from\ndiverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting. Even\nhere, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --\nindicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that\ntask-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent\ncapabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a\nsimple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

In this work, we present a cascaded\nLLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of\nexpertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and\nknowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model\ncascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy\ndetermines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the\nlarge model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides\nwhether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human\nintervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the\nframework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over\ntime. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and\nARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA).

This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex\nvisual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image\ndetails. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel\nreasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained\nvisual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the\nquestion or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects\nrelevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise\nanswers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a\nlarge-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed\nvision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows\nthe model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is\nintroduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,\nenhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline\nshow that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring\ncomprehensive image detail understanding.
