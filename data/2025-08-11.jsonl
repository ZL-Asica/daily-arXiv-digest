We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000\nLLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.\nExperimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in\nrole-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response\ndiversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for\nfuture research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at\nhttps://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime."}

Accordingly,\nautonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their\nenvironment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.\nHowever, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase\nvehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE\nlevels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,\ncontextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly\nwith the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.\nThese developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the\nbroader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered\nmobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles\n(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and\ninteract within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level\nframework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative\nlayers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant\nadvances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine\ninteraction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and\ntool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive\nagents embedded in mobility ecosystems.

We first analyze the\ndistribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers and observe that LLMs are\noverconfident across languages, frequently generating strengtheners even as\npart of incorrect responses.

Accordingly,\nautonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their\nenvironment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.\nHowever, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase\nvehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE\nlevels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,\ncontextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly\nwith the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.\nThese developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the\nbroader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered\nmobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles\n(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and\ninteract within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level\nframework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative\nlayers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant\nadvances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine\ninteraction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and\ntool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive\nagents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key\nchallenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety,\nreal-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory\nframeworks."}

Specifically, new\n  clarification on complex system foundation related to Noosemia has been added\n  (Secs. \"2.4 and \"2.5\")", "summary": "This paper introduces and formalizes Noosem\\`ia, a novel\ncognitive-phenomenological pattern emerging from human interaction with\ngenerative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal\nexchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under\ncertain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even\ninteriority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,\nbut in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological\ncomplexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical\nnotion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct\nmeaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the\nhuman-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,\nanimism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its\nunique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the\nphenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with\nreflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological and social\nimplications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research."}

Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely\non superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods\nstruggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present\na novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative\npolicy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically\ntailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical\nchallenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy\nlearning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and\ninadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation\npipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation\nand abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley\nFunction Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\\% overall\naccuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\\% on complex multi-function\nscenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on\ncode-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation\ncapabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning\nin function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to\nbenefit the community."}

Current AI evaluation practices\ndepend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to\nmeasure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.\nThis research addresses the urgent need to quantify this \"benchmark-regulation\ngap.\" We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses\nvalidated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from\nwidely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities\nand propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation\necosystem dedicates the vast majority of its focus to a narrow set of\nbehavioral propensities. On average, benchmarks devote 61.6% of their\nregulatory-relevant questions to \"Tendency to hallucinate\" and 31.2% to \"Lack\nof performance reliability\", while critical functional capabilities are\ndangerously neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control\nscenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous\nAI development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This\nstudy provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap,\ndemonstrating that current public benchmarks are insufficient, on their own,\nfor providing the evidence of comprehensive risk assessment required for\nregulatory compliance and offering critical insights for the development of\nnext-generation evaluation tools."}
