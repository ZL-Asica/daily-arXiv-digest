Current mobile\nsensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine\nlearning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to\nmodel student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each\nLLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by\nsmartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict\nindividual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological\nmomentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality\nquestionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting\ntechniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management\nstrategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily\nactivities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This\nallows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original\ndataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the\nimpact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by\nmanipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using\nquestionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral\nchanges that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates\nhypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their\nmental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling\nwith sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student\nmental health."}

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality.

Through a user study with N=100 participants on a\nrepresentative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the\ninference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy\nis higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI\nagent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and\nthe extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence\ncalibration of the AI agent.

On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS).

Yet, AI-driven moderation systems struggle\nwith low-resource languages spoken in these regions. Through semi-structured\ninterviews with 22 AI experts working on harmful content detection in four\nlow-resource languages: Tamil (South Asia), Swahili (East Africa), Maghrebi\nArabic (North Africa), and Quechua (South America)--we examine systemic issues\nin building automated moderation tools for these languages. Our findings reveal\nthat beyond data scarcity, socio-political factors such as tech companies'\nmonopoly on user data and lack of investment in moderation for low-profit\nGlobal South markets exacerbate historic inequities. Even if more data were\navailable, the English-centric and data-intensive design of language models and\npreprocessing techniques overlooks the need to design for morphologically\ncomplex, linguistically diverse, and code-mixed languages. We argue these\nlimitations are not just technical gaps caused by \"data scarcity\" but reflect\nstructural inequities, rooted in colonial suppression of non-Western languages.\nWe discuss multi-stakeholder approaches to strengthen local research capacity,\ndemocratize data access, and support language-aware solutions to improve\nautomated moderation for low-resource languages."}

These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse\ndistribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical\nrelationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that\nlead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and\ntwo multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the\nreliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source\nscenarios. \\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in\nhttps://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG."}
