Traditional visualization\nteaching methods, which usually rely on directly translating conceptual aspects\nof data into concrete data visualizations, often fail to attend to the needs of\nnovice learners navigating this tension. To address this, we conducted an\nempirical exploration of how analogies can be used to help novices with chart\ncomprehension. We introduced visualization analogies: visualizations that map\ndata structures to real-world contexts to facilitate an intuitive understanding\nof novel chart types. We evaluated this pedagogical technique using a\nwithin-subject study (N=128) where we taught 8 chart types using visualization\nanalogies. Our findings show that visualization analogies improve visual\nanalysis skills and help learners transfer their understanding to actual\ncharts. They effectively introduce visual embellishments, cater to diverse\nlearning preferences, and are preferred by novice learners over traditional\nchart visualizations.

A recent development in time series XAI is the\nconcept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can\nbe interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as\nfrequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the\ntime domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate\nattributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and\nfrequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This\nsuggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more\ncomprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain\nexplanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty\nprinciple (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in\nharmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle\nestablishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized\nin both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess\nwhether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound,\nindicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a\nsufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not\nmatch and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the\neffectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI\nmethods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The\nfrequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods\nhighlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on\ntime-domain explanations.

Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators\nincluding critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less\ntextual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence\nlength...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature\nimportance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze\nthese vectors in a shared \"preference space\". Reader vectors cluster into two\nprofiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize\nreadability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who\nvalue thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our\nresults quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a\nfunction of how text features align with each reader's preferences. These\nfindings advocate for reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of\ncreative text generation."}

Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing\nand large language models, current news generation methods often struggle with\nhallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and lack of domain-specific expertise\nwhen producing news articles. ScoreRAG addresses these challenges through a\nmulti-stage framework combining retrieval-augmented generation, consistency\nrelevance evaluation, and structured summarization. The system first retrieves\nrelevant news documents from a vector database, maps them to complete news\nitems, and assigns consistency relevance scores based on large language model\nevaluations. These documents are then reranked according to relevance, with\nlow-quality items filtered out. The framework proceeds to generate graded\nsummaries based on relevance scores, which guide the large language model in\nproducing complete news articles following professional journalistic standards.\nThrough this methodical approach, ScoreRAG aims to significantly improve the\naccuracy, coherence, informativeness, and professionalism of generated news\narticles while maintaining stability and consistency throughout the generation\nprocess.

These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as\nsyntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we\nexplore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced\nby an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information\nrate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies\nsimultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension\ncalled time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information\ncontours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and\nBrazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in\ninformation rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure,\nsuggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization.\nBeyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse\nstructure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural\npressures at various levels of linguistic granularity."}

Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the\nperformance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing\ndynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical\ndeployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/EIT-NLP/SkipGPT."}

NUDGING is motivated\nby recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a\nsmall subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base\nmodels are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building\non this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging\ntokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's\nuncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We\nevaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction\ntasks.

However, in\nopen-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking\ngames), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens,\nresulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a\nspace can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance,\nhindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose\nARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient\nand effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language\nactions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a\nlow-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are\nclustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation\nreduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy\noptimization.
