To address this\ngap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods\nat varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse\ncollection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural\nlanguage while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our\nexperiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis\nreveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are\npreferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while\nstatistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than\nprefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear\nstrategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of\nsparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even\nmoderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on\nat least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal\nsolution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored\nfor sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold\ntrue beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate\nthat sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer\nLLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of\ntrade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sparse attention enhances long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs but involves complex trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy.", "motivation": "To explore the viability, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies of sparse attention methods in Transformer LLMs for long-context tasks.", "method": "Conducted a comparison of training-free sparse attention methods across different model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a variety of long-sequence tasks.", "result": "The study found that larger, sparse models are preferable for long sequences, existing sparsity levels vary in effectiveness depending on the model phase, and no single strategy is optimal across all tasks, alongside novel scaling laws for sparse attention.", "conclusion": "Sparse attention significantly improves the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for longer sequences, but careful consideration of trade-offs is necessary for performance-sensitive applications."}}
