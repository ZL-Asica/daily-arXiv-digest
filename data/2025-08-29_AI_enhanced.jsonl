Prior studies have\nnoted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted\npre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to\nhandle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For\nLarge Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or\ninstructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the\nmodel's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address\nthese issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based\non LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph\nAttention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency\nfeatures. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on\nsoft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance\nproximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by\nLLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be\ncaptured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of\nminority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.\nExperiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "GDLLM is a Global Distance-aware approach for Event Temporal Relation Extraction, improving the identification of temporal relations in Natural Language Processing by enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models, particularly for minority relation classes.", "motivation": "To improve the performance of Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) using Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing limitations of minority class relations in imbalanced datasets and noise introduced by manual prompts.", "method": "We propose GDLLM, which integrates a distance-aware graph structure with Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a soft inference-based temporal feature learning paradigm to enhance the learning of long-distance and short-distance dependencies.", "result": "GDLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TB-Dense and MATRES datasets, particularly improving the identification of minority relation classes in ETRE.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework significantly enhances LLM's learning capabilities and overall performance in temporal relation extraction.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of the GDLLM framework", "Integration of distance-aware graph structure with LLMs", "State-of-the-art performance on temporal relation extraction tasks."], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["Event Temporal Relation Extraction", "Large Language Models", "Graph Attention Network"], "importance_score": 9, "read_time_minutes": 15}}
