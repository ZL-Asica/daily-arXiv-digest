Each CV pair\nwas presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences\nin candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical\nprofessional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored\nfemale-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit\ngender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for\nfemale applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral\nidentifiers \"Candidate A\" and \"Candidate B\", several models displayed a\npreference to select \"Candidate A\". Counterbalancing gender assignment between\nthese gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate\nselection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs\nassigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect\nsize was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a\ncandidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected\nregardless of gender.

These findings\nunderscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous\ndecision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply\nprincipled reasoning."}

We improve agent\ndistillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method\ncalled first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated\ntrajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for\nimproving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight\nreasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both\nin-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small\nas 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier\nlarger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the\npotential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small\nagents.

Experiments reveal that (i) phase transitions align with clear\nintersections between curvature collapse and dimension stabilisation; (ii)\nthese geometric shifts coincide with emerging syntactic and semantic accuracy;\n(iii) abstraction patterns persist across architectural variants, with\ncomponents like feedforward networks affecting optimisation stability rather\nthan fundamentally altering trajectories. This work advances our understanding\nof how linguistic abstractions emerge in LMs, offering insights into model\ninterpretability, training efficiency, and compositional generalisation that\ncould inform more principled approaches to LM development."}

This implicit policy\nis parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive\ndata, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct\nexperiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently\nshow that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT\nsignificantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning,\nmatching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in\nstrict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different\ntheoretical foundations.

Under this guidance, this framework utilizes a causal\nintervention-based data rewriting method to automatically and autonomously\nbalance the distribution of instruction-tuning dataset for reducing the\ninformation gain. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised fine-tuning\nprocess to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results show that\nICD can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability across different\ntasks."}

In each layer, each chain from the output\nrepresentations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input\nrepresentations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can\nprogressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the\nprevious models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes\nfor elastic inference by using different chain numbers.

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks\nmay not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their\napplicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration\nstrategy for the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's memory in\nthe concurrent KV cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a\nparallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in\nparallel with the same attention cache, with \"instant\" access to each other's\nmemory. Hogwild! Inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)\nto avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find\nthat modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value\ncache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning."}
