Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some\nreluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the\npotential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,\nproviding valuable insights for the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper analyzes the effectiveness of three LLMs in generating Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for educational purposes, highlighting GPT-3.5's superiority and addressing AI adoption reluctance among educators.", "motivation": "To explore the potential of LLMs in generating MCQs, making the assessment process more efficient for educators.", "method": "A comparative analysis of Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 was conducted by injecting knowledge into prompts and evaluating the generated MCQs through metrics with feedback from 21 educators.", "result": "GPT-3.5 was found to generate the most effective MCQs according to several metrics, reflecting its potential in educational applications.", "conclusion": "LLMs can significantly improve the generation of MCQs, enhancing the educational experience, though educators still show reluctance towards AI integration.", "key_contributions": ["Comparative analysis of Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 for MCQ generation.", "Emphasizing the method of injecting knowledge into prompts for better control.", "Insights into educator reluctance regarding AI adoption in education."], "limitations": "The study relies on the effectiveness of the LLMs for generating MCQs but does not address wider implications of AI in education.", "keywords": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Large Language Models", "Multiple-Choice Questions", "Educational Technology", "AI Adoption"], "importance_score": 9, "read_time_minutes": 10}}
