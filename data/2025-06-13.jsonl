Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

Our results also show that this bias is stronger\nin smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,\nversus 8% for the GPT-4o model.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework\ndesigned to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core\ninnovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for\neach language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.\nThis approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving\nmultilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation\nacross three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,\ndemonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight\nits potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge\nupdates in LLMs. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/VRCMF/LangEdit.git."}

We identify two key research questions: how can we\nenable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level\nreasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details,\nwe use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes.\nHowever, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To\ntackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which\nintroduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual\nrepresentation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of\nprimitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their\ncorresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data\nand represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics.\nThis abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by\nfoundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data,\nempirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs\nlike GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive\nanalyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled\nperception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between\nPVD quality and task performance.

We observe that while\ncertain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to\n-42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting\nsensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics.\nThese findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning\nsystems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning\nalignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and\nevaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient\nLLM reasoning."}

Our findings reveal\nthat AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different\nagents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover,\nbehavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers\nand merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These\nresults underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also\nintroduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating\nbusiness decisions to AI agents."}

One intuitive solution, namely\nchain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of\nLLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on\nperformance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the\ninstructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for\nidentifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To\nthis end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex\ninstructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First,\nwe stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing\ntaxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we\nexploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals\nto cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the\nshallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via\nsample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior\ncloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking\nLLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive\nbenchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM\nachieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

We focus on a specific aspect of the\nlegal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark\n(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether\nexecutive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate\ngovernance charters.

The model's task\nis one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent\nwith the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following\nestablished principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate\ngovernance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters\nselected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life\ncorporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models\nconfirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet\nand GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively.

Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to\ncapture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a\nshared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement.

Jointly considering the desire and technological\ncapability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation \"Green Light\"\nZone, Automation \"Red Light\" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.\nThis highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.\nMoving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse\nHAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for\nhuman involvement.
