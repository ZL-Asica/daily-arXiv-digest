Newer forms of real-time engagement($\\textit{e.g.}$, users\ncommenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures\non the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,\nrelatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this\npaper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool\n($\\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful\ncontent. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test\nbeds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over\n$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\\texttt{AutoMod}$'s\naccuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,\nableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful\nmessages, up to $94\\%$ on some datasets, $\\textit{bypass moderation}$.\nContextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\\%$ removal,\nrevealing $\\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We\nalso find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\\texttt{AutoMod}$\nblocks up to $89.5\\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in\npedagogical or empowering contexts.

These assistants, available\ntoday as browser extensions, can not only track detailed browsing activity such\nas search and click data, but can also autonomously perform tasks such as\nfilling forms, raising significant privacy concerns. It is crucial to\nunderstand the design and operation of GenAI browser extensions, including how\nthey collect, store, process, and share user data. To this end, we study their\nability to profile users and personalize their responses based on explicit or\ninferred demographic attributes and interests of users. We perform network\ntraffic analysis and use a novel prompting framework to audit tracking,\nprofiling, and personalization by the ten most popular GenAI browser assistant\nextensions. We find that instead of relying on local in-browser models, these\nassistants largely depend on server-side APIs, which can be auto-invoked\nwithout explicit user interaction. When invoked, they collect and share webpage\ncontent, often the full HTML DOM and sometimes even the user's form inputs,\nwith their first-party servers. Some assistants also share identifiers and user\nprompts with third-party trackers such as Google Analytics. The collection and\nsharing continues even if a webpage contains sensitive information such as\nhealth or personal information such as name or SSN entered in a web form. We\nfind that several GenAI browser assistants infer demographic attributes such as\nage, gender, income, and interests and use this profile--which carries across\nbrowsing contexts--to personalize responses.
