However, when applied to\nlong-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational\nefficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a\ncontext compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which\naddresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant\ninformation. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer\nSemantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently\nextract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on\nthe other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level\nprimary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different\nlayers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain\ncomplete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to\ndownstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract\nknowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly\nsampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this\ncondition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression\nparadigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly\nfaster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in\nend-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and\nvarious state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents GMSA, a context compression framework that enhances the efficiency of LLMs in long-context scenarios by reducing input sequence length and redundant information.", "motivation": "Large language models struggle with low computational efficiency and redundancy when handling long texts, necessitating improved methods for context management.", "method": "The GMSA framework includes Group Merging for effective summary extraction and Layer Semantic Alignment to ensure coherent integration of summary vectors with input semantics, trained via autoencoders and fine-tuning.", "result": "GMSA achieves significant improvements in context restoration, speed, and stability in training, particularly demonstrating a 2x speedup in end-to-end inference for QA tasks.", "conclusion": "GMSA not only enhances performance in speech processing but also stabilizes convergence with fewer resources, showing promise for practical applications in NLP tasks.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of Group Merging for summary vector extraction", "Development of Layer Semantic Alignment to bridge semantic gaps", "Implementation of Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning for downstream adaptation"], "limitations": "", "keywords": ["large language models", "context compression", "natural language processing", "semantic alignment", "knowledge extraction"], "importance_score": 9, "read_time_minutes": 15}}

Secondly, we show that cross-task length generalization\nis possible with Meta-RFFT.
