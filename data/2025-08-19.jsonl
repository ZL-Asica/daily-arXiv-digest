We systematically\nevaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and\nDeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning\ndiverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with\nthinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish\nlogarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a\npredictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings\nidentify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)\nsuitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering\noptimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and\nhigh-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.\nNotably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from\nextended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger\nmodels, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides\ngreater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific\npatterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring\nsignificantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory\nmedicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our\nproposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of\nthinking budget concepts across architectures.

Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a\nregion-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation.\nInterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively\ncapture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction\nmechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to\nsystematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative\nresults show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new\nbenchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research."}

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of\ndifferent features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and\nusing fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of\ncontextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings\ninvolving conversations."}

In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets.

For the\ndefender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the\ninitial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this\nseems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the\ndefender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate\nmiddle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential\ngeneration order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and\ndiverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this\nasymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method\nthat directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals\nexploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security\nperformance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the\nutility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning.

Our experimental results reveal that: (1) simply\ncontrolling the context length and curating the training data based on the\ninput prompt length can effectively improve the training efficiency of RL\nscaling, achieving better performance with more concise CoT; (2) properly\nscaling the context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) carefully\nchoosing the context length facilitates achieving efficient LLM training and\nreasoning. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum RL\nframework with stage-wise context scaling to achieve efficient LLM training and\nreasoning.

A key innovation is our end-to-end reinforcement\nlearning strategy, optimizing both parent and child inference threads to\nenhance task success rate without requiring predefined reasoning structures.\nExperiments on the Countdown reasoning task demonstrate significant benefits of\nAPR: (1) higher performance within the same context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% at\n4k context); (2) superior scalability with increased computation (80.1% vs.\n66.6% at 20k total tokens); (3) improved accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2%\nvs. 57.3% at approximately 5,000ms). APR represents a step towards enabling\nlanguage models to autonomously optimize their reasoning processes through\nadaptive allocation of computation."}

Within this process, document reranking plays a critical role in\nrefining first-stage retrieval results. However, standard LLM listwise\nreranking faces challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is\noften suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked\nlower. Meanwhile, conventional listwise reranking places the full text of\ncandidates into the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can\nbe considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before\nreranking, constraining overall retrieval performance. To address these\nchallenges, we explore semantic-feature-based compact document representations\n(e.g., categories, sections, and keywords) and propose CoRank, a training-free,\nmodel-agnostic reranking framework for scientific retrieval. It presents a\nthree-stage solution: (i) offline extraction of document features, (ii)\ncoarse-grained reranking using these compact representations, and (iii)\nfine-grained reranking on full texts of the top candidates from (ii). This\nintegrated process addresses suboptimal first-stage retrieval: Compact\nrepresentations allow more documents to fit within the context window,\nimproving candidate set coverage, while the final fine-grained ranking ensures\na more accurate ordering. Experiments on 5 academic retrieval datasets show\nthat CoRank significantly improves reranking performance across different LLM\nbackbones (average nDCG@10 from 50.6 to 55.5).
