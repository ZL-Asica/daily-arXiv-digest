User interfaces are complex and their\nimplementations often consist of multiple, inter-related files that together\nspecify the contents of each screen, the navigation flows between the screens,\nand the data model used throughout the application. It is challenging to craft\na single prompt for an LLM that contains enough detail to generate a complete\nuser interface, and even then the result is frequently a single large and\ndifficult to understand file that contains all of the generated screens. In\nthis paper, we introduce Athena, a prototype application generation environment\nthat demonstrates how the use of shared intermediate representations, including\nan app storyboard, data model, and GUI skeletons, can help a developer work\nwith an LLM in an iterative fashion to craft a complete user interface. These\nintermediate representations also scaffold the LLM's code generation process,\nproducing organized and structured code in multiple files while limiting\nerrors.

This paper explores the current\nlandscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical\nresearch context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of\nrecent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\\'c et\nal., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and\nevaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of\nself-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy\nand full-proof validity.\n  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI\ninto the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented\nmathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical\nguidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding\nprinciples for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore\nseven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from\ncreativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these\nprinciples translate into concrete practice.\n  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than\nautomation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,\ncritical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use\nthese powerful tools."}

However, little work has\nexamined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.\nDue to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more\ncontext does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could\npredict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could\nstop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final\ndecision.\n  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to\ngenerate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to\nquantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we\nmeasure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step\nusing conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the\nvocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear\npattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated\nwith correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong\nanswers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer\nthan correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield\nbetter outcomes.

Interact. 9, 7, Article CSCW", "summary": "As families face increasingly complex safety challenges in digital and\nphysical environments, generative AI (GenAI) presents new opportunities to\nsupport household safety through multiple specialized AI agents. Through a\ntwo-phase qualitative study consisting of individual interviews and\ncollaborative sessions with 13 parent-child dyads, we explored families'\nconceptualizations of GenAI and their envisioned use of AI agents in daily\nfamily life. Our findings reveal that families preferred to distribute\nsafety-related support across multiple AI agents, each embodying a familiar\ncaregiving role: a household manager coordinating routine tasks and mitigating\nrisks such as digital fraud and home accidents; a private tutor providing\npersonalized educational support, including safety education; and a family\ntherapist offering emotional support to address sensitive safety issues such as\ncyberbullying and digital harassment. Families emphasized the need for\nagent-specific privacy boundaries, recognized generational differences in trust\ntoward AI agents, and stressed the importance of maintaining open family\ncommunication alongside the assistance of AI agents. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a multi-agent system design featuring four privacy-preserving\nprinciples: memory segregation, conversational consent, selective data sharing,\nand progressive memory management to help balance safety, privacy, and autonomy\nwithin family contexts."}

Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles\n(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and\nsynthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic\ndialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real\nconversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater\nemotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns\nof reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real\nand synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings\nunderscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight\nthe importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We\nintroduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future\nresearch in this space."}

ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices.

We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories\n(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a\nstandardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs.

We delve into\nLLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task\nstem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the\nsensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues,\nwe propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value\nDecomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by\ntransforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This\ntransformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into\nthe transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy.\nAdditionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize\nlayer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different\nLLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the\nsuccess of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the\nself-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By\nreducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV\ncache can be largely reduced.

Our experiments with widely used\nLLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state\nknowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving\nperformance comparable to commercial LLMs. The dataset are publicly available\nat: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mashi6n/nhkrecipe-100-anno-1"}

However, their reliance on dense video token\nrepresentations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in\nboth prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video\ntoken reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs\nlosslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)\nframework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.\nBuilding on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low\nsensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to\nenable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we\nperforms a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens\nguided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II\nprunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive\nexperiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\\times$\ndecoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\\times$ speedup for\nQwen2.5-VL-32B.

This text appears to offer a human-readable window into\ntheir computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and\ninterpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this\ntext matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to\nidentify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We\nevaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual\nmeasurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only\n29%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the\nmajority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a\nfundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use\nit, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool.

While\neffective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical\nlimitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to\ndegraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited\ninter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt\nconcatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information\nloss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS\nbuilt on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.\nUnlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent\ncollaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,\nidentify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm\nreduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and\nminimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and\ncost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved\n52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the\nstrongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM\nsettings.

Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing\nquality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint\nfollowing (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing methods find it\ndifficult to balance these two aspects: single reward strategies fail to\nimprove both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight mixed-reward methods\nlack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios. To address this\nproblem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), utilizing\na dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model evaluating\nsubjective writing quality and a constraint verification model assessing\nobjective constraint following. The constraint following reward weight is\nadjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled groups,\nensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in GRPO and\nthus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this proposed\nmethod. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse model\nfamilies from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a real-world\nwriting benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation. Results\nillustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both instruction\nfollowing (IFEval from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate\nin manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the best of our\nknowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with\nobjective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution\nfor multi-dimensional creative writing optimization."}
