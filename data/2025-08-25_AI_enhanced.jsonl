While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech.

Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning.

One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance\npressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision\nmaking. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently\nlow-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and\nsimple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior\nby manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show\ncomplex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI\ntechniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior. We conclude\nby discussing the implications of these interactions, strategies to effectively\nuse pressure, and encourage future research to incorporate pressure analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates the effects of performance pressure and explainable AI on human-AI decision-making, revealing how incentives and time limits can influence advice-taking behavior in low-stakes tasks.", "motivation": "To address the challenges in human-AI collaboration, particularly issues of trust and the perceived efficacy of AI in subjective tasks.", "method": "The authors conducted experiments using a spam review classification task, manipulating financial incentives and time limits to create performance pressure and analyzing its effects on AI advice-taking.", "result": "The results indicate complex interactions between pressure and XAI techniques that can either enhance or detract from the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration, depending on the specific combinations employed.", "conclusion": "The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding how performance pressure interacts with AI system explanations to inform better strategies in human-AI decision-making processes.", "key_contributions": ["Examined the interaction of performance pressure with AI advice-taking behavior.", "Demonstrated practical methods to induce performance pressure in low-stakes tasks.", "Discussed the implications of pressure and XAI techniques on decision-making with AI."], "limitations": "The study is based on a low-stakes task, which may not generalize to high-stakes decision-making environments.", "keywords": ["human-AI collaboration", "performance pressure", "explainable AI", "decision making", "AI advice-taking"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}
