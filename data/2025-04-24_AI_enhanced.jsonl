PBMs\nprovide mechanistic insights based on physical and biological principles,\nensuring interpretability and scientific rigour. However, they often struggle\nwith scalability, parameterisation, and adaptation to heterogeneous\nenvironments. In contrast, DL models excel at capturing complex, nonlinear\npatterns from large datasets but may suffer from limited interpretability, high\ncomputational demands, and overfitting in data-scarce scenarios.\n  This study presents a systematic review of PBMs, DL models, and hybrid PBM-DL\nframeworks, highlighting their applications in agricultural and environmental\nmodelling. We classify hybrid PBM-DL approaches into DL-informed PBMs, where\nneural networks refine process-based models, and PBM-informed DL, where\nphysical constraints guide deep learning predictions. Additionally, we conduct\na case study on crop dry biomass prediction, comparing hybrid models against\nstandalone PBMs and DL models under varying data quality, sample sizes, and\nspatial conditions. The results demonstrate that hybrid models consistently\noutperform traditional PBMs and DL models, offering greater robustness to noisy\ndata and improved generalisation across unseen locations.\n  Finally, we discuss key challenges, including model interpretability,\nscalability, and data requirements, alongside actionable recommendations for\nadvancing hybrid modelling in agriculture.

However, its effective use in machine\nlearning (ML) is often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy\nconcerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a\npromising solution, leveraging generative models to learn the distribution of\nreal datasets and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving samples. Various\ngenerative paradigms have been explored, including energy-based models (EBMs),\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large\nlanguage models (LLMs), and diffusion models. While several surveys have\ninvestigated synthetic tabular data generation, most focus on narrow subdomains\nor specific generative methods, such as GANs, diffusion models, or\nprivacy-preserving techniques. This limited scope often results in fragmented\ninsights, lacking a comprehensive synthesis that bridges diverse approaches. In\nparticular, recent advances driven by LLMs and diffusion-based models remain\nunderexplored. This gap hinders a holistic understanding of the field`s\nevolution, methodological interplay, and open challenges. To address this, our\nsurvey provides a unified and systematic review of synthetic tabular data\ngeneration. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a comprehensive\ntaxonomy that organizes existing methods into traditional approaches,\ndiffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, and provide an in-depth\ncomparative analysis; (2) we detail the complete pipeline for synthetic tabular\ndata generation, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation; (3)\nwe identify major challenges, explore real-world applications, and outline open\nresearch questions and future directions to guide future work in this rapidly\nevolving area.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper provides a comprehensive survey on synthetic data generation for tabular data, addressing the limitations of existing surveys and proposing a unified framework.", "motivation": "To address the fragmented insights in synthetic tabular data generation and explore recent advances in generative models, specifically LLMs and diffusion models.", "method": "The authors propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes existing methods and provide an in-depth comparative analysis, along with a detailed pipeline for data generation and evaluation.", "result": "A systematic review of synthetic tabular data generation that categorizes methods into traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, identifies challenges, and outlines real-world applications and future research directions.", "conclusion": "The survey aims to bridge diverse approaches in the field, enhance understanding of methodological interplay, and guide future research in synthetic tabular data generation."}}

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution.
