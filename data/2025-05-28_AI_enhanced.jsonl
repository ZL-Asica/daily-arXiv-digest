Additionally, query prefixes\nare typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing\nthe likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text\ngeneration tasks.

Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve an average\naccuracy of 20-60% under in-context learning and 50-60% with fine-tuning,\nhighlighting a substantial gap in their ability to classify mathematical\nsymbols.
