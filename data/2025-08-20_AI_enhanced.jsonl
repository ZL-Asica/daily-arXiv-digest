The SEA-LION family of LLMs\nsupports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese,\nMalay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages\nlarge-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive\npost-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning,\nalignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks\nindicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs\nsupporting SEA languages.

In an effort to\nunderscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines\nprimary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America\nand Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization\ntherein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant\ngaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating\nsociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models\nwould play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach\ninforms better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to\nmore adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily\nuser growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area.
