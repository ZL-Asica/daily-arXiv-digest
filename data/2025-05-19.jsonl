To address this, we explored a more flexible\napproach and engineered a system that generates muscle-stimulation-instructions\ngiven the user's context. Through our examples, we show that such a system is\nflexible: it enables unprecedented EMS-interactions (e.g., opening a\nchild-proof pill bottle cap) but also replicates existing systems (e.g., shake\na spray can)-all without requiring task-specific programming. To achieve this,\nour system takes in user's spoken-requests and images from their point of view.\nIt uses computer vision (e.g., detect objects/handedness) and\nlarge-language-models (e.g., reason about objects/situations) to generate\ntextual-instructions.

GUMs\nintroduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from\nmultimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and\ncontinuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of\napplications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based\nassistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface\nimportant information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences\nacross apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover\nand execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM.

In this work, we propose to generate ranked answers in each\nreasoning process and conduct ranked voting among multiple ranked answers from\ndifferent responses, thereby making the overall self-consistency more reliable.\nSpecifically, we use three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda\ncount voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting. We validate our methods on six\ndatasets, including three multiple-choice and three open-ended\nquestion-answering tasks, using both advanced open-source and closed-source\nlarge language models. Extensive experimental results indicate that our\nproposed method outperforms the baselines, showcasing the potential of\nleveraging the information of ranked answers and using ranked voting to improve\nreasoning performance.

As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users\noften struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable\nclassification.

Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,\na 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's\nclassification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm\nbehavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,\ndata-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder\nboundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants\ncompared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the\nReviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was\nassessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and\nthe control of orientation.

Prior\napproaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget\nconstraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical\ninformation from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We\nhypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more\nconcise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy\nOptimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum\nlength over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO\nemploys a novel length reward function based on this history state to\nincentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those\npreviously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing\nshorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards\nmore efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness\nreward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to\ntrain DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and\nQwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span\nvarious difficulty levels.

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token\nspace by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and\nSoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can\nfurther enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode\ninformative thinking without the information loss associated with\nautoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in\ncontinuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling\nenables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous\nspace are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all\ndecoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling\nparadigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths.

Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to\ninterpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to\nintricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of\nscaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric\ntraining is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in\nlearning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement\nlearning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss\nfunctions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and\nexpressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and\nsupporting compatibility with closed-source models.

To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the\nfirst many-shot in-context reasoning benchmark for pattern recognition that\nasks LLM to predict output via input-output examples from underlying functions\nwith diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for\nmany-shot in-context reasoning, and acquired many insightful findings including\nscaling effect, robustness, inductive vs. transductive reasoning, retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG), coding for inductive reasoning, cross-domain\ngeneralizability, etc."}

To address this, we propose Structured Preference\nOptimization (SPO), which aims to enhance reasoning and action selection in\nlong-horizon task planning through structured preference evaluation and\noptimized training strategies. Specifically, SPO introduces: 1)\nPreference-Based Scoring and Optimization, which systematically evaluates\nreasoning chains based on task relevance, visual grounding, and historical\nconsistency; and 2) Curriculum-Guided Training, where the model progressively\nadapts from simple to complex tasks, improving its generalization ability in\nlong-horizon scenarios and enhancing reasoning robustness. To advance research\nin vision-language long-horizon task planning, we introduce ExtendaBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering 1,509 tasks across VirtualHome and Habitat\n2.0, categorized into ultra-short, short, medium, and long tasks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that SPO significantly improves reasoning quality and final\ndecision accuracy, outperforming prior methods on long-horizon tasks and\nunderscoring the effectiveness of preference-driven optimization in\nvision-language task planning.

In\nthis study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically\nprobing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various\nmodel families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning\nbenchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric.\nSurprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit\nfundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform\ntheir base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher\npass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the\nobserved reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model.\nTreating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that\nsix popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in\nleveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that\ndistillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and\ngenuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities.

Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered\nmuch of what users may ask them to generate in some form during their training.\nA plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess model\nquality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However, the\nhuman effort required for benchmark construction is rapidly being outpaced by\nthe size and scope of the models under evaluation. Having humans build a\nbenchmark for every possible domain of interest is impractical. Therefore, we\npropose a methodology for automating the construction of fact-based synthetic\ndata model evaluations grounded in document populations.
