**TL;DR:** This study analyzes the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on blind and low-vision developers, highlighting both benefits and new accessibility challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how the integration of LLMs in software development affects blind and low-vision (BLV) developers, acknowledging both potential benefits and new accessibility challenges introduced by these technologies.

**Method:** A review of existing literature was conducted alongside an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance on various programming tasks and observing interactions of BLV developers.

**Result:** The evaluation revealed unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and significant limitations in interaction support, emphasizing key interaction barriers faced by BLV developers beyond model accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The findings underline the need to address accessibility challenges while harnessing LLM technologies, suggesting that improving accessibility can significantly enhance the programming experience for BLV developers as generative AI continues to evolve.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to a wide range of tools, tasks, and problem-solving processes, especially in software development. Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also address the unique burdens faced by this community.

### [2] [What Makes for a Good Saliency Map? Comparing Strategies for Evaluating Saliency Maps in Explainable AI (XAI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17023)

*Felix Kares, Timo Speith, Hanwei Zhang, Markus Langer*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** The paper evaluates three saliency map approaches (LIME, Grad-CAM, Guided Backpropagation) using subjective, objective, and mathematical evaluation methods to assess their effectiveness in explaining neural network classifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of consensus on how to effectively evaluate saliency maps used for explaining the classifications of neural networks.

**Method:** A between-subject study with 166 participants was conducted to examine subjective user measures (trust and satisfaction), objective user measures (ability and understanding), and mathematical metrics for three saliency map methods.

**Result:** The study found that evaluations across methods do not agree; Grad-CAM improved user abilities the most, Guided Backpropagation had the best mathematical metrics, and there was no significant difference in user trust and satisfaction among the maps.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the complexity in evaluating explainable AI approaches and suggest that both user studies and mathematical metrics should be considered complementary in understanding saliency maps.

**Abstract:** Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of (convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1) for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e., there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.

### [3] [Psychological Effect of AI driven marketing tools for beauty/facial feature enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17055)

*Ayushi Agrawal, Aditya Kondai, Kavita Vemuri*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** AI-powered facial assessment tools impact self-objectification, self-esteem, and emotional responses differently based on design and gender.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the psychological effects of AI-powered facial assessment tools on individuals, focusing on self-objectification and self-esteem, and examining gender differences.

**Method:** Participants used one of two versions of a facial analysis tool (overtly critical or neutral) and completed validated scales measuring self-objectification, self-esteem, and emotions, along with custom items related to appearance enhancement and perceived social emotions.

**Result:** Findings indicated high self-objectification correlating with low self-esteem and increased appearance enhancement behaviors in both tool versions, while the neutral tool still triggered negative emotions. Gender differences were noted, with females more likely to engage in digital enhancement and less aware of social emotional impacts.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for responsible AI design to mitigate reinforcement of social biases stemming from these tools and suggests directions for future research on the influence of training data on AI outputs.

**Abstract:** AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9 years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these, in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.

### [4] [DashGuide: Authoring Interactive Dashboard Tours for Guiding Dashboard Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17150)

*Naimul Hoque, Nicole Sultanum*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** DashGuide is a framework that simplifies the creation of interactive guidance for dashboards, enabling quicker and more effective authoring of guidance materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Dashboard guidance enhances user navigation and understanding of data insights but is often difficult and time-consuming to create and implement effectively.

**Method:** DashGuide captures user interactions on a dashboard to generate guidance materials as step-by-step overlays, allowing authors to edit and refine these tours with generative support.

**Result:** Evaluation with 12 dashboard creators indicated that DashGuide improves the authoring experience by effectively balancing efficiency, expressiveness, and creative freedom.

**Conclusion:** DashGuide streamlines the process of creating dashboard guidance, enhancing usability without compromising authoring quality.

**Abstract:** Dashboard guidance helps dashboard users better navigate interactive features, understand the underlying data, and assess insights they can potentially extract from dashboards. However, authoring dashboard guidance is a time consuming task, and embedding guidance into dashboards for effective delivery is difficult to realize. In this work, we contribute DashGuide, a framework and system to support the creation of interactive dashboard guidance with minimal authoring input. Given a dashboard and a communication goal, DashGuide captures a sequence of author-performed interactions to generate guidance materials delivered as playable step-by-step overlays, a.k.a., dashboard tours. Authors can further edit and refine individual tour steps while receiving generative assistance. We also contribute findings from a formative assessment with 9 dashboard creators, which helped inform the design of DashGuide; and findings from an evaluation of DashGuide with 12 dashboard creators, suggesting it provides an improved authoring experience that balances efficiency, expressiveness, and creative freedom.

### [5] [Improving Human-Autonomous Vehicle Interaction in Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17170)

*Robert Kaufman*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** The paper highlights the need for tailored communication in autonomous vehicles (AVs) to meet diverse rider needs and improves real-world adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Unresolved questions about AV communication hinder adoption as different riders have varied informational needs based on individual traits, goals, and driving contexts.

**Method:** The author uses three empirical studies to identify optimal communication strategies, analyze the consequences of faulty systems, and employ machine learning to predict trust in AVs based on personal factors.

**Result:** The studies reveal that effective AV communication should be task-sensitive and modality-appropriate, and that individualized communication strategies enhance trust and performance in AV settings.

**Conclusion:** The dissertation advocates for adaptable and personalized AV communication systems, providing insights for designers and researchers to enhance human-AV interactions and guide future human-AI research.

**Abstract:** Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success. Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive, modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent, adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals, and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers, researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

### [6] [Augmenting Captions with Emotional Cues: An AR Interface for Real-Time Accessible Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17171)

*Sunday David Ubur*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** The paper presents an AR framework for enhancing captioning for Deaf and Hard of Hearing learners by integrating emotional cues into live transcriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve accessibility and comprehension for Deaf and Hard of Hearing learners in STEM classrooms by providing more context-rich captioning options.

**Method:** The framework combines real-time speech recognition with emotional and visual signals, including facial expressions and gestures, to create enriched captions rendered in an AR interface using Unity.

**Result:** Preliminary evaluations indicate that the AR captioning approach significantly improves comprehension and reduces cognitive effort compared to traditional captioning methods.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the effectiveness of immersive technologies in providing inclusive and emotion-aware educational experiences for learners with hearing impairments.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces an augmented reality (AR) captioning framework designed to support Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) learners in STEM classrooms by integrating non-verbal emotional cues into live transcriptions. Unlike conventional captioning systems that offer only plain text, our system fuses real-time speech recognition with affective and visual signal interpretation, including facial movements, gestures, and vocal tone, to produce emotionally enriched captions. These enhanced captions are rendered in an AR interface developed with Unity and provide contextual annotations such as speaker tone markers (e.g., "concerned") and gesture indicators (e.g., "nods"). The system leverages live camera and microphone input, processed through AI models to detect multimodal cues. Findings from preliminary evaluations suggest that this AR-based captioning approach significantly enhances comprehension and reduces cognitive effort compared to standard captions. Our work emphasizes the potential of immersive environments for inclusive, emotion-aware educational accessibility.

### [7] [Lessons from Deploying Learning-based CSI Localization on a Large-Scale ISAC Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17173)

*Tianyu Zhang, Dongheng Zhang, Ruixu Geng, Xuecheng Xie, Shuai Yang, Yan Chen*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a large-scale CSI-based localization system using over 400 Access Points to improve indoor localization accuracy in a real-world setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to enhance the deployment and commercialization of CSI-based localization, which has been limited by previous small-scale evaluations and the underutilization of unlabeled data.

**Method:** A novel graph-based learning framework is proposed, leveraging a pretext pretraining task for large-scale unlabeled CSI data and a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to improve robustness.

**Result:** The system achieved a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%, showing an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the best baseline.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach significantly improves CSI-based localization performance in large-scale real-world environments, addressing challenges such as data redundancy and the use of unlabeled data.

**Abstract:** In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing baseline.

**Method:** The authors introduce a wearable fact-checking system that provides discreet alerts to potential falsehoods through vibrotactile feedback, integrated with devices like smartwatches or rings.

**Result:** Factually's utility is illustrated through three scenarios, and early feedback indicates its effectiveness in improving users' fact-checking skills.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that Factually could significantly extend cognitive abilities, providing both practical benefits in misinformation detection and enhancing critical thinking skills.

**Abstract:** Wearable devices are transforming human capabilities by seamlessly augmenting cognitive functions. In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.

### [9] [MV-Crafter: An Intelligent System for Music-guided Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17267)

*Chuer Chen, Shengqi Dang, Yuqi Liu, Nanxuan Zhao, Yang Shi, Nan Cao*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** MV-Crafter is a system that automates high-quality music video generation, facilitating an easier creation process for non-professionals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The creation of music videos poses challenges for non-professionals due to the need for skills in script design, video shooting, and synchronization.

**Method:** MV-Crafter employs three modules: script generation using a large language model, video generation, and a dynamic beat matching algorithm for synchronization.

**Result:** Experiments show that MV-Crafter produces high-quality music videos with improved synchronization and intuitive creation features.

**Conclusion:** MV-Crafter effectively enhances the music video creation process, making it accessible for users without professional skills.

**Abstract:** Music videos, as a prevalent form of multimedia entertainment, deliver engaging audio-visual experiences to audiences and have gained immense popularity among singers and fans. Creators can express their interpretations of music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of music video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and music-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for non-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation frameworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output quality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing high-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our approach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation process: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video synchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate scripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of synchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a dynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to ensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a user-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an effective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.

### [10] [Exploring Context-aware and LLM-driven Locomotion for Immersive Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17331)

*Süleyman Özdel, Kadir Burak Buldu, Enkelejda Kasneci, Efe Bozkir*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** A novel hands-free locomotion technique for virtual reality, utilizing large language models, shows promise in natural language navigation while maintaining usability and enhancing user attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve user experience in virtual reality by offering a speech-based locomotion alternative that is flexible and accessible, moving away from rigid command sets of traditional methods.

**Method:** The study evaluates three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering, and a language model-driven approach, using eye-tracking analysis, SHAP analysis, and standardized questionnaires for various user engagement metrics.

**Result:** The LLM-driven locomotion method demonstrates comparable usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to teleportation, enhances user attention, and shows distinct patterns in visual attention and cognitive processing through SHAP analysis.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method provides a comfortable, natural language-driven, hands-free locomotion alternative in virtual environments, particularly benefitting accessibility.

**Abstract:** Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering, and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence, cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in supporting accessibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient retrieval of multi-perspective data facts to construct comprehensive and objective narratives in data storytelling.

**Method:** DataScout employs an LLM-based agent to create a retrieval tree, allowing collaborative expansion between users and the agent, while visualizing this as a mind map for intuitive navigation.

**Result:** Case studies and expert interviews show that DataScout effectively retrieves multifaceted data facts, aiding users in verifying their statements and improving narrative credibility.

**Conclusion:** DataScout significantly enhances the data storytelling process by streamlining data fact retrieval and supporting users in their analytical efforts.

**Abstract:** A data story typically integrates data facts from multiple perspectives and stances to construct a comprehensive and objective narrative. However, retrieving these facts demands time for data search and challenges the creator's analytical skills. In this work, we introduce DataScout, an interactive system that automatically performs reasoning and stance-based data facts retrieval to augment the user's statement. Particularly, DataScout leverages an LLM-based agent to construct a retrieval tree, enabling collaborative control of its expansion between users and the agent. The interface visualizes the retrieval tree as a mind map that eases users to intuitively steer the retrieval direction and effectively engage in reasoning and analysis. We evaluate the proposed system through case studies and in-depth expert interviews. Our evaluation demonstrates that DataScout can effectively retrieve multifaceted data facts from different stances, helping users verify their statements and enhance the credibility of their stories.

### [12] [The Riemannian Means Field Classifier for EEG-Based BCI Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17352)

*Anton Andreev, Grégoire Cattan, Marco Congedo*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** The paper improves the Riemannian minimum distance to mean classifier for EEG-based BCIs by using power means of SPD matrices, resulting in better performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the performance of the robust and efficient MDM classifier used in EEG-based BCIs.

**Method:** An improved MDM classifier using multiple power means of symmetric positive-definite matrices is proposed and evaluated on 20 public databases.

**Result:** The proposed classifier outperforms the traditional MDM classifier in performance across 20 public databases with a total of 587 individuals.

**Conclusion:** The new classifier approaches state-of-the-art performance while maintaining simplicity and deterministic characteristics, with open-source code to facilitate reproducible research.

**Abstract:** A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the Riemannian minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier for all kinds of EEG-based brain--computer interfaces (BCIs). This classifier is simple, fully deterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to transfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation of a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior. In order to promote reproducible research, our code will be released as open source.

**TL;DR:** The paper examines the sociotechnical AI governance related to AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII), highlighting shortcomings in current regulatory practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the growing issue of AIG-NCII and understand the role of AI governance in preventing its proliferation.

**Method:** Adopting a survivor-centered approach, the authors analyze a 'malicious technical ecosystem' of tools facilitating the creation of AIG-NCII and evaluate the effectiveness of existing governance frameworks.

**Result:** The paper identifies a significant failure in current governance practices to regulate the malicious technical ecosystem for adult AIG-NCII, driven by flawed assumptions and inadequate safeguards.

**Conclusion:** Enhanced governance strategies are needed to effectively address the challenges posed by AIG-NCII and mitigate its impact.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as "deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or "MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200 "nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining these gaps.

### [15] ['The Boring and the Tedious': Invisible Labour in India's Gig-Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17697)

*Pratyay Suvarnapathaki, Viral Shah, Saarthak Negi, Nimmi Rangaswamy*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**TL;DR:** The paper analyzes the challenges faced by gig workers in India's food delivery sector, particularly focusing on digital discomfort caused by waiting times and repetitive user interfaces, and suggests a shift towards worker-centered design solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the crucial income provided to marginalized communities by gig-based food delivery platforms while exposing the cycles of invisible labor and digital discomfort experienced by workers.

**Method:** Conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with gig-based food delivery agents to explore their experiences, focusing on waiting times and user interface interactions.

**Result:** Identified creative strategies used by workers to navigate algorithmic management, but highlighted ongoing constraints due to platform gamification and a lack of transparency in systems.

**Conclusion:** Argues for a rethinking of HCI approaches in the Global South, emphasizing the need to prioritize worker autonomy over efficiency-focused design optimizations.

**Abstract:** India's gig-based food delivery platforms, such as Swiggy and Zomato, provide crucial income to marginalised communities but also entrench workers in cycles of invisible labour. Through 14 semi-structured interviews, we analyse waiting time and repetitive UI itneractions as key burdens that contribute to 'digital discomfort' for gig based food delivery agents. We find that workers employ creative strategies to navigate algorithmic management, yet remain constrained by platform-side 'gamification' and system opacity. We propose worker-centered GUI automation as a potential intervention to reduce friction while preserving agency. In conclusion, this position paper argues for rethinking HCI approaches in the Global South to prioritise worker autonomy over efficiency-driven design optimisations.

**Abstract:** Online experiments using metaverse platforms have gained significant traction in Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality (VR) research. However, current research workflows are highly fragmented, as researchers must use separate tools for system implementation, participant recruitment, experiment execution, and data collection, reducing consistency and increasing workload. We present LUIDA (Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments), a metaverse-based framework that integrates these fragmented processes. LUIDA automatically allocates interconnected virtual environments for parallel experiment execution and provides implementation templates adaptable to various VR research domains, requiring minimal metaverse development expertise. Our evaluation included two studies using a prototype built on Cluster, the commercial metaverse platform. First, VR researchers using LUIDA to develop and run experiments reported high usability scores (SUS: 73.75) and moderate workload (NASA-TLX: 24.11) for overall usage, with interviews confirming streamlined workflows compared to traditional laboratory experiments. Second, we conducted three replicated experiments with public Cluster users, each recruiting approximately 200 participants within one week. These experiments produced results that closely matched the original studies, validating the experimental integrity of LUIDA across research domains. After technical refinements, we plan to release LUIDA as an open platform, providing a standardized protocol to improve research efficiency and experimental reproducibility in VR studies.

*Cong Qi, Hanzhang Fang, Tianxing Hu, Siqi Jiang, Wei Zhi*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** GeneMamba is a scalable and efficient model for single-cell RNA sequencing that improves upon transformer models by capturing bidirectional gene context with linear complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the computational challenges posed by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.

**Method:** GeneMamba utilizes a state space modeling approach with the Bi-Mamba architecture, which enables linear-time complexity and incorporates biologically informed pretraining strategies.

**Result:** GeneMamba shows strong performance in multiple tasks such as multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, while being interpretable and robust.

**Conclusion:** GeneMamba serves as a practical alternative to transformer-based models, advancing tools for analyzing large-scale single-cell transcriptomics.

**Abstract:** Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.

### [18] [Tokenization Matters: Improving Zero-Shot NER for Indic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16977)

*Priyaranjan Pattnayak, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Amit Agarwal*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** SentencePiece outperforms Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages, showing better entity consistency and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate tokenization methods for Named Entity Recognition in low resource Indic languages and address the limitations of BPE due to morphological complexity.

**Method:** A systematic comparison of BPE, SentencePiece, and Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT on NER tasks across various Indic languages.

**Result:** SentencePiece consistently outperforms BPE in NER tasks, particularly in zero shot cross-lingual settings, while BPE struggles with entity misclassification.

**Conclusion:** SentencePiece is the more effective tokenization strategy for NER in multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications, benefiting both morphological preservation and generalization.

**Abstract:** Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual transfer.   Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.

### [19] [Optimizing LLMs for Italian: Reducing Token Fertility and Enhancing Efficiency Through Vocabulary Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17025)

*Luca Moroni, Giovanni Puccetti, Pere-Lluis Huguet Cabot, Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Edoardo Barba, Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Andrea Esuli, Roberto Navigli*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method called Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA) to optimize English Large Language Models for the Italian language, resulting in improved efficiency and performance across various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) mostly cater to the English language, leading to inefficiencies when adapting them for non-English languages due to issues like language contamination and non-optimized multilingual pretraining data.

**Method:** The authors compare various vocabulary adaptation techniques and propose SAVA, which employs neural mapping for vocabulary substitution to optimize the encoding of models for Italian.

**Result:** SAVA achieves competitive performance and reduces token fertility by 25% for Mistral-7b-v0.1 and decreases the parameters by 1 billion for Llama-3.1-8B, with continued training recovering performance effectively on the target language.

**Conclusion:** The adaptation of vocabulary significantly enhances the models’ performance on multilingual tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of SAVA for improving LLMs in non-English contexts.

**Abstract:** The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily, though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility") and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally, we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and generative tasks.

### [20] [Do Words Reflect Beliefs? Evaluating Belief Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17052)

*Shariar Kabir, Kevin Esterling, Yue Dong*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The paper evaluates the belief depth in Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding political discourse, revealing their topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate whether LLM responses represent genuine beliefs or just surface-level alignment with training data, particularly in political discourse.

**Method:** A novel framework was proposed to evaluate belief depth through argumentative consistency and uncertainty quantification, applying it to 12 LLMs and 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test.

**Result:** The analysis showed that LLMs displayed consistent responses based on topic, with up to 95% of left-leaning and 89% of right-leaning models remaining stable under scrutiny; semantic entropy achieved high accuracy (AUROC=0.78) in distinguishing surface-level alignment from genuine belief.

**Conclusion:** The findings challenge the notion that LLMs possess stable political ideologies, highlighting the need for topic-specific assessments of reliability in practical applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse, yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny. While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains: Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2) uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance. Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability assessments for real-world applications.

### [21] [Agree to Disagree? A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17075)

*Arjun Subramonian, Vagrant Gautam, Preethi Seshadri, Dietrich Klakow, Kai-Wei Chang, Yizhou Sun*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The paper systematically evaluates various methods for measuring LLM misgendering and finds significant disagreements among them, highlighting the need for improved evaluation practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study investigates whether existing methods for evaluating LLM misgendering yield consistent results, addressing a gap in the understanding of the validity of these methods.

**Method:** A systematic meta-evaluation of existing probability- and generation-based evaluation methods across three datasets for LLM misgendering, including transformations for parallel evaluations and human validation.

**Result:** The evaluation revealed that the different methods disagree on 20.2% of instances, indicating substantial variation at the instance, dataset, and model levels, supplemented by human evaluation showing complexity in misgendering that surpasses pronoun issues.

**Conclusion:** The findings question the reliability of current LLM evaluation methodologies and recommend improvements for future evaluations to enhance the accuracy of assessing LLM misgendering.

**Abstract:** Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences) and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

### [22] [How Individual Traits and Language Styles Shape Preferences In Open-ended User-LLM Interaction: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17083)

*Rendi Chevi, Kentaro Inui, Thamar Solorio, Alham Fikri Aji*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates how the language style of LLM responses affects user preferences, revealing that style influences user opinions but varies by individual traits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the factors that make interactions with LLMs preferable for users, exploring the impact of language style alongside accuracy.

**Method:** Preliminary exploratory and experimental user studies were conducted to analyze the influence of LLM's language style on user preferences across different populations.

**Result:** Language style significantly influences user preferences, but the effect varies among different user populations and is moderated by individual traits.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that while language style can enhance user experience, it may also increase the risk of misinformation; further research is needed with larger and more diverse samples.

**Abstract:** What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users' preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences: enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject. Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and which language styles influence the preference varied across different user populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples, which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style, individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential causal relationship between and beyond these variables.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an Interactive Chain-of-Thought Framework to enhance human-centered explainability and responsible AI usage by enabling transparent, modular, and editable reasoning processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rise of short-form content and AI has led to a decline in deep thinking and critical engagement with AI outputs, necessitating solutions to foster better cognitive engagement.

**Method:** The framework decomposes reasoning into inspectable and editable blocks, incorporates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism for user preferences, and ensures ethical transparency through metadata, bias checks, and privacy safeguards.

**Result:** The proposed framework encourages active cognitive engagement and responsible interactions with AI, accommodating diverse user cognitive styles and fostering critical thinking.

**Conclusion:** The design principles and architecture outlined support the responsible adaptation of AI systems to address complex societal issues, promoting critical engagement.

**Abstract:** Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI, opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished, undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent, modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the mechanisms of censorship in large language models (LLMs) through the identification of vectors that control refusal and compliance in model outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation stems from the need to understand how LLMs are tuned to restrict certain responses and how this impacts access to information.

**Method:** The authors employ representation engineering techniques and introduce a method for identifying a refusal-compliance vector that quantifies the level of censorship, while also analyzing reasoning LLMs for additional forms of censorship related to thought suppression.

**Result:** The study finds a refusal-compliance vector that effectively detects censorship levels and identifies a vector that can suppress the reasoning process, enabling the removal of certain censorship by applying negative multiples of it.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the complex dynamics of censorship in LLMs and provide a framework for manipulating model behavior to explore the breadth of their generative capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** PaperCoder is a framework that utilizes multi-agent large language models to convert machine learning papers into functional code repositories, enhancing reproducibility in research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The lack of available code implementations for machine learning research hinders replication and development, necessitating an efficient solution.

**Method:** PaperCoder operates through three stages: planning (creating a high-level roadmap and identifying dependencies), analysis (interpreting implementation details), and generation (producing modular, dependency-aware code), using specialized agents at each phase.

**Result:** Evaluation shows that PaperCoder produces high-quality code implementations that are faithful to the original papers, as validated by both model-based and human assessments, including comparisons with author-released repositories and strong performances on the PaperBench benchmark.

**Conclusion:** PaperCoder effectively facilitates the generation of reproducible code from machine learning research papers, demonstrating significant advantages over existing baselines.

**Abstract:** Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.

**Result:** WildfireGPT outperforms existing LLM-based solutions in decision support, as validated by evaluations in ten expert-led case studies.

**Conclusion:** The proposed RAG-based system effectively improves the accuracy and relevance of information for decision-makers facing natural hazards.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme natural hazard events.

As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates knowledge distillation (KD) approaches to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for bundle generation, addressing computational challenges while maintaining performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing use of LLMs for bundle generation highlights efficiency issues related to their high computational costs during fine-tuning and inference, necessitating more effective deployment strategies.

**Method:** The study explores various KD approaches by proposing a framework that gradually extracts knowledge, evaluates different quantities of distilled knowledge, and utilizes complementary adaptation techniques to apply this knowledge in compact models for better efficiency in bundle generation.

**Result:** Extensive experiments reveal how the format, quantity, and application of distilled knowledge affect the performance of LLMs in bundle generation, demonstrating significant potential for improving efficiency through KD.

**Conclusion:** The findings affirm that knowledge distillation can substantially enhance the performance of compact models for LLM-based bundle generation, making them more practical for real-world applications.

**Abstract:** LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts); (ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques (in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.

**TL;DR:** CRDial is a novel framework for Cognitive Restructuring (CR) that enhances psychotherapeutic dialogue through multi-turn interactions and supportive strategies, utilizing a large-scale dataset to improve conversational LLMs for CR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the clinician shortage and stigma surrounding mental health care by developing a human-LLM interactive psychotherapy framework for effective Cognitive Restructuring (CR).

**Method:** CRDial implements multi-turn dialogues with tailored identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates supportive conversation strategies, and employs a multi-channel loop mechanism for iterative CR. The framework is trained on Crisp, a high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset distilled from LLM.

**Result:** Human studies demonstrate that Crispers, the Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, show superiority in pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations compared to existing approaches.

**Conclusion:** The proposed CRDial framework and the Crispers conversational models significantly enhance the effectiveness of Cognitive Restructuring in a psychotherapeutic context.

**Abstract:** Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap, we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and 14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.

Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl, all verified by native language experts. We leverage Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy. To further enhance performance, we apply transfer learning using MarianNMT pre-trained models within the SimpleTransformers framework. Our RNN-based system achieves competitive results, closely matching existing English-Igbo benchmarks. With transfer learning, we observe a performance gain of +4.83 BLEU points, reaching an estimated translation accuracy of 70%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of effective Unsupervised Domain Adaptation methods for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains, especially given the complexity of legal texts and scarcity of annotated datasets.

**Method:** JurisCTC uses contrastive learning to improve model performance on Legal Judgment Prediction tasks, specifically transferring knowledge between civil and criminal law.

**Result:** JurisCTC achieves peak accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, outperforming existing models and specific large language models.

**Conclusion:** The proposed JurisCTC model significantly enhances the accuracy of Legal Judgment Prediction tasks by leveraging effective knowledge transfer techniques.

**Abstract:** In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains. Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** This study addresses fairness issues in AI text generation for medical applications, finding significant biases across demographics and proposing a selective optimization algorithm to reduce these biases while maintaining performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper investigates the fairness problem in AI text generation in the medical field, responding to concerns about biases affecting historically under-served populations and the performance of AI systems.

**Method:** An algorithm is proposed that selectively optimizes underperformed demographic groups based on word-level accuracy and pathology accuracy, while ensuring the process is differentiable for model training.

**Result:** The algorithm reduced performance disparities among various demographic groups by over 30%, with less than 2% relative change in text generation accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach enhances fairness in medical text generation without compromising performance, aiming to improve the reliability of AI diagnoses.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races, sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales, and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** CoheMark is a novel sentence-level watermarking technique that balances watermark robustness and text quality by leveraging cohesive sentence relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing sentence-level watermarking methods often rely on arbitrary segmentation, limiting the selection of appropriate sentences and compromising the quality of generated responses.

**Method:** CoheMark utilizes trained fuzzy c-means clustering to select sentences and applies specific criteria for next sentence selection, enhancing logical fluency in watermarking.

**Result:** Experimental evaluations show that CoheMark achieves strong watermark strength with minimal impact on the quality of generated text.

**Conclusion:** CoheMark effectively balances watermark robustness with high text quality, making it a significant advancement in watermarking technology.

**Abstract:** Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for a systematic evaluation tool to analyze model robustness against minimal variations in test data, specifically focusing on linguistic factors.

**Method:** FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels using large language models and human validation to generate modifications, and is applied to evaluate various NLP tasks.

**Result:** The evaluation reveals that the impact of linguistic variations is task-dependent, LLMs are generally more robust but still vulnerable to specific variations, and all models struggle with negation modifications.

**Conclusion:** Systematic robustness testing is essential for understanding model behaviors, particularly in response to linguistic variations.

**Abstract:** We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of social media as a primary information source, misinformation spreads rapidly, necessitating advanced detection methods that consider human empathy.

**Method:** The DAE integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both content creators' and readers' perspectives, utilizing Large Language Models to simulate responses and judgments.

**Result:** Experimental results show that DAE outperforms traditional misinformation detection methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

**Conclusion:** DAE represents a novel, human-centric approach to multimodal misinformation detection that enhances response authenticity and diversity.

**Abstract:** In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation. Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.

**Result:** Experimental results validate that MRE can be observed in the M-MRE task, showcasing mutual gains in multimodal text-image understanding scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The findings confirm the generalizability of MRE beyond the textual domain, indicating its potential benefits in multimodal contexts.

**Abstract:** Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the textual domain.

*Jose G. Moreno, Jesus Lovon, M'Rick Robin-Charlet, Christine Damase-Michel, Lynda Tamine*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The paper presents PatientDx, a model merging framework that enhances healthcare predictive tasks without fine-tuning on sensitive patient data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address data privacy concerns in healthcare when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using sensitive annotated data.

**Method:** PatientDx employs a merging strategy of LLMs with a pivotal model adapted for numerical reasoning, tuning hyperparameters based on performance metrics without direct training on patient data.

**Result:** Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset showed up to a 7% improvement in AUROC over initial models, and PatientDx demonstrated a reduced risk of data leakage compared to fine-tuned models.

**Conclusion:** PatientDx effectively balances performance enhancement and data privacy, making it a valuable approach for health-predictive tasks.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data. Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/ Jgmorenof/mistral\_merged\_0\_4.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses the challenges of long-context understanding in natural language processing by introducing a new spoken long-text dataset and evaluating language models on it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks fail to capture the complexities of real-world dialogues, limiting the applicability of large language models (LLMs) to practical scenarios involving speech-based, redundant, and unevenly dense information.

**Method:** We constructed a spoken long-text dataset derived from live streams, featuring tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent, and hybrid. We evaluated various LLMs and specialized methods on these tasks to assess their long-context understanding.

**Result:** Results reveal that existing methods struggle with redundancy in inputs and favor specific tasks, with no single method consistently outperforming others. The proposed new baseline performs better in handling redundancy.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights limitations of current approaches to long-context understanding and provides a new benchmark that aids evaluation and development of spoken language understanding applicable to real-world e-commerce systems.

**Abstract:** Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent, and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing TOD systems often produce generic responses that do not reflect user individuality or adapt to personal attributes, impacting user satisfaction.

**Method:** The study introduces the PicPersona-TOD dataset, utilizing user images and incorporating factors like age and emotional context, along with a new NLG model called Pictor for personalized dialogue generation.

**Result:** Human evaluations show that personalized responses from the PicPersona dataset significantly improve user experience and engagement in dialogues, while Pictor shows strong performance across various domains.

**Conclusion:** The use of user images and personalized dialogue mechanisms in PicPersona-TOD leads to enhanced interactions in TOD systems, paving the way for more engaging and effective communication.

**Abstract:** Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests through natural language interactions, yet existing systems often produce generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen domains https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PicPersona.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses limitations in interpretability and practicality of topic models for specific social science research questions, alongside challenges in reproducibility and cost of traditional qualitative analysis.

**Method:** The authors apply LLM-generated text augmentations in a case study related to political science, using topic modeling techniques to analyze the resulting output.

**Result:** The results show that the augmented topic modeling produces highly interpretable categories, which facilitate research on domain-specific questions with minimal human involvement.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that LLM-generated text augmentation significantly improves the interpretability and practical application of topic modeling in social science research.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific research questions with minimal human guidance.

*Xin Yi, Shunfan Zhengc, Linlin Wanga, Xiaoling Wang, Liang He*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a unified framework called CDG-KD for conducting bidirectional attacks on watermarks in language models, addressing vulnerabilities in watermarking techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to address the vulnerabilities of watermarking techniques in language models against attacks such as scrubbing and spoofing, which remain inadequately explored.

**Method:** The authors propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), which uses contrastive decoding to generate amplified watermark texts from a student model and weakly watermarked references, facilitating bidirectional attacks during unauthorized knowledge distillation.

**Result:** CDG-KD successfully enables watermark removal and forgery attacks while maintaining the performance of the distilled models, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the urgent need for the development of watermarking schemes that are both robust and unforgeable to enhance the protection of intellectual property and combat misinformation.

**Abstract:** Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues of user trust and system adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Hallucinations in LLMs lead to responses that do not align with user input or training data, which undermines trust and hinders the adoption of generative AI systems.

**Method:** The paper introduces a taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, along with new extrinsic evaluation tasks and a dynamic test set generation approach to prevent data leakage.

**Result:** The proposed benchmark facilitates a consistent evaluation of hallucinations and highlights limitations in existing benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing hallucinations from factuality.

**Conclusion:** Establishing a clear taxonomy and robust benchmark for hallucinations is essential for advancing research and improving the reliability of LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs. This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from factuality evaluations.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** Prepending metadata during language model pre-training affects performance, yielding both positive and negative outcomes depending on context length and inferability of latent semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the performance differences in language models when metadata is prepended to pre-training data, and why improvements are task-specific.

**Method:** The study examines the effects of prepending metadata using artificial data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, analyzing model behavior in relation to downstream task prompts.

**Result:** Prepending metadata can improve performance on downstream tasks when the context is long enough to infer latent semantics; however, it can also harm performance when the context is insufficient for posterior inference.

**Conclusion:** The effectiveness of metadata prepending in enhancing language model performance is contingent on the capability of the context to convey necessary latent semantics.

**Abstract:** The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

**Motivation:** The drive to better understand base model training processes and the quality of data used in training LLMs, despite their recent successes in reasoning tasks.

**Method:** A large-scale reasoning dataset with 3.34 million unique queries and 40 million responses was constructed, and valuable training data was selected based on pass rates and Coefficient of Variation. Enhanced training methods included using higher learning rates for reasoning-focused training.

**Result:** A pass rate of 79.2% was achieved on the AIME2024 benchmark, surpassing most current distilled models and nearing state-of-the-art performance.

**Conclusion:** The study develops a methodology for improving reasoning in LLMs through the careful selection of training data and training techniques, and all datasets and methods are publicly available to encourage advancements in this area.

**Abstract:** Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-Distilled-40M

### [48] [Evaluating Grounded Reasoning by Code-Assisted Large Language Models for Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17665)

*Zena Al-Khalili, Nick Howell, Dietrich Klakow*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The study analyzes code-assisted language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning tasks, revealing significant differences in how well these models ground their code in math rules, affecting their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of rigorous evaluation of generated programs by code-assisted LLMs, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning tasks.

**Method:** An in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs across five different models and two math datasets, assessed both manually and automatically to evaluate grounding to math rules.

**Result:** The analysis showed that grounding distribution varies with model capabilities and problem difficulty, with closed-source models showing better grounding than open-source models; specifically, on MATH500, grounded programs decreased while ungrounded ones doubled compared to ASDiv problems.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive evaluations that go beyond mere execution accuracy to better understand code-assisted LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in mathematical reasoning.

**Abstract:** Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math domain.

**Result:** Evaluations show that the SCP framework maintains theoretical guarantees across multiple LVLMs and calibration-to-test split ratios, demonstrating stable performance and robustness in practical applications.

**Conclusion:** The study successfully bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical use in multi-modal AI systems, providing a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

**Abstract:** This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

**Conclusion:** The results emphasize the importance of tailored inference efficiency optimizations for reducing energy consumption in LLM deployments, providing a basis for future energy-efficient AI infrastructure design.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings, often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that using smaller language model ensembles can yield high-performance AI systems while making effective use of available computational resources.

**Abstract:** This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our approach.

### [53] [Multilingual Performance Biases of Large Language Models in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17720)

*Vansh Gupta, Sankalan Pal Chowdhury, Vilém Zouhar, Donya Rooein, Mrinmaya Sachan*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** The paper evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in educational tasks across multiple languages, finding significant performance drops in lower-resource languages compared to English.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine the suitability of large language models for educational settings in non-English languages, given their prevalent use in English-centric applications.

**Method:** The study assesses the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks (identifying misconceptions, providing feedback, tutoring, and grading translations) across six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech, and English).

**Result:** Performance on educational tasks generally correlates with the amount of language data the LLMs are trained on, revealing significant performance drops for lower-resource languages when compared to English.

**Conclusion:** Practitioners should ensure the LLM performs effectively in the target language for specific educational tasks prior to deployment.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** A user study compares a neurosymbolic conversational assistant with a ChatGPT-based one for heart failure patients' inquiries about food salt content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate and compare traditional conversational architectures with generative AI in healthcare settings, specifically for heart failure patient support.

**Method:** A within-group user study comparing two versions of a conversational assistant: a neurosymbolic architecture and a ChatGPT-based system.

**Result:** The in-house system was more accurate, completed more tasks, and was less verbose, while the ChatGPT system made fewer speech errors and required fewer clarifications, with no patient preference for either system.

**Conclusion:** Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, and patient preferences do not favor one architecture over the other.

**Abstract:** Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture, and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no preference for one over the other.

### [55] [The Sparse Frontier: Sparse Attention Trade-offs in Transformer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17768)

*Piotr Nawrot, Robert Li, Renjie Huang, Sebastian Ruder, Kelly Marchisio, Edoardo M. Ponti*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**TL;DR:** Sparse attention can extend long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, but its efficiency and accuracy trade-offs need careful evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a gap in understanding the viability, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and scaling studies of sparse attention in Transformer models for long-context tasks.

**Method:** A comparison of training-free sparse attention methods was performed at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels across a diverse set of long-sequence tasks.

**Result:** Key findings include the preference for larger sparse models for long sequences, variations in sparsity during decoding vs. pre-filling, no single best strategy across tasks, and the introduction of new scaling laws for sparse attention.

**Conclusion:** Sparse attention enhances Transformer LLM capabilities for longer sequences, but necessitates careful evaluation of trade-offs in performance-sensitive applications.

**Abstract:** Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.
