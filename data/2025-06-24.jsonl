However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate\nsuch generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms\nof imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety\nscenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that\nevaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain\nthese decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image\nsnippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,\neither regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less\nrelevant feature (i.e., actions).

Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their\nbehaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf."}

For the information systems being designed and developed to\nsupport researchers and scientists in conducting their work, conceptual models\nof the relevant domains are usually designed as both blueprints for a system\nbeing developed and as a means of communication between the designer and\ndeveloper. Most conceptual modelling concepts are generic in the sense that\nthey are applied with the same understanding across many applications. Problems\nin the life sciences, however, are especially complex and important, because\nthey deal with humans, their well-being, and their interactions with the\nenvironment as well as other organisms. This work proposes a systemist\nperspective for creating a conceptual model of a life scientist's problem. We\nintroduce the notion of a system and then show how it can be applied to the\ndevelopment of an information system for handling genomic-related information.\nWe extend our discussion to show how the proposed systemist perspective can\nsupport the modelling of precision medicine. This research recognizes\nchallenges in life sciences research of how to model problems to better\nrepresent the connections between physical and digital worlds.

While previous efforts have explored geometric or\nhardware based mitigation strategies, such methods often rely on predefined\nscene structures, manual tuning, or intrusive equipment. In this work, we\npropose U-MAD, a lightweight, real-time, AI-based solution that suppresses\nperceptually disruptive optical flow directly at the image level. Unlike prior\nhandcrafted approaches, this method learns to attenuate high-intensity motion\npatterns from rendered frames without requiring mesh-level editing or scene\nspecific adaptation. Designed as a plug and play module, U-MAD integrates\nseamlessly into existing VR pipelines and generalizes well to procedurally\ngenerated environments. The experiments show that U-MAD consistently reduces\naverage optical flow and enhances temporal stability across diverse scenes. A\nuser study further confirms that reducing visual motion leads to improved\nperceptual comfort and alleviated cybersickness symptoms.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

These innovations\nencompass a new entropy regularization, a novel data scheduling policy, and an\nimproved group-relative advantage estimator. Collectively, they significantly\nstabilize the RL training, improve data efficiency, and boost performance. Our\nwork demonstrates the feasibility of building strong reasoning models in a\nparticular domain at low cost.

However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively\nexpensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves\nsimilar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated\nparameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having\nsignificantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning\ncombined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating\nhigh-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE\narchitectures.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.

Despite the importance of\nthis task, there is a significant lack of publicly available datasets that\nsupport automatic short-answer grading with feedback generation. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Engineering Short Answer Feedback (EngSAF), a dataset\ndesigned for automatic short-answer grading with feedback.

Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously\nprovide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model\nresponses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal\nexperience."}

In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA\nbenchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key\nagent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a\nstandard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,\nnon-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we\nintroduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study\nreveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while\nothers are redundant, despite seeming logical.

Given\na user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of\ninductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,\nSLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation\nprogram used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and\n(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create\nSLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum\nlevels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive\ncomplexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily\nproduce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.\nRecent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in\ntest-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,\nlogic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity\nwith Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully\nautomated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a\nscalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities."}
