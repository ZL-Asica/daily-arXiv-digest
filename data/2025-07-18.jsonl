What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains."}

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics\nthrough a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific\ndistillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion\nregression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and\nmultimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset.

In\nour evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry,\nSecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9\npercent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based\nevaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights\nSecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG."}

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA\nperformance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its\nincredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that\nexcels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours\nof video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and\nreasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini\n2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute\nand latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high\nperformance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model\ngeneration spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing\nusers to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic\nproblem solving."}

This paper investigates the\nresponse robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts - we test nine diverse\nLLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive\nset of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure,\nresulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal\nLLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models\nexhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately\nfavoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally\nmore robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like\nparaphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations,\nwe reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in\nhumans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and\nrobustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data."}

RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long\nChain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance\nof LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that\nsystematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs\nand RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various\nmethods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the\neffects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment\nmethods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:\n(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of\nLLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess\ninherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional\nmethods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced\nmultilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance\nof LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for\nRLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and\nRLLMs in the field of financial question answering."}

We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark.
