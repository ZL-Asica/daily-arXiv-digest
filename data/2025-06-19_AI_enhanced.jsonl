To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite\nobjective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem\ndecomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that\nreinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.\nOptimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns\nacross all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks\n(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both\naccuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines.
