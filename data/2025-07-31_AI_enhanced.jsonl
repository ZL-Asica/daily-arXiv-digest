This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent\nwriting by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In\nthis work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework\nfor evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a\npatent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a\nconsistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting\nstrategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER\ngoes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output\nquality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,\nBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,\nand applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.\nWe also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.\nExperimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and\nstylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific\nbaselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and\nfuture research.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces PATENTWRITER, a benchmarking framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in generating patent abstracts, analyzing their output quality against established metrics and tasks.", "motivation": "To address the challenges in the tedious and complex process of patent writing by utilizing large language models for abstract generation.", "method": "The study evaluates six leading LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, under various prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) while assessing output quality with standard NLP metrics and conducting stylistic analysis.", "result": "Experimental results demonstrate that modern LLMs generate high-fidelity patent abstracts that often outperform domain-specific baselines across multiple quality dimensions.", "conclusion": "The results suggest that LLMs can effectively improve patent writing processes, with the framework and datasets provided for future research.", "key_contributions": ["Introduction of PATENTWRITER as a unified benchmarking framework for LLMs in patent abstract generation", "Comprehensive evaluation of LLM output quality using a diverse set of metrics", "Open-sourcing code and dataset for reproducibility and future exploration"], "limitations": "The study focuses on patent abstract generation and does not cover other aspects of patent writing or broader implications of LLMs in different scientific domains.", "keywords": ["Patent Writing", "Large Language Models", "Benchmarking Framework", "Natural Language Processing", "Evaluation Metrics"], "importance_score": 8, "read_time_minutes": 15}}
