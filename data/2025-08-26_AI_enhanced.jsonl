A major\nchallenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization\nover relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge\nbase is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)\nsuffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we\npropose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end\ntraining of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a\nstochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is\nparticularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question\nanswering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly\noutperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG.

Even for professional human\ntranslators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics\nthroughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used\nto iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by\nan advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is\nalso employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way,\nwe collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train\nour DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the\nthought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well\nas LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long\nthought, showing its effectiveness.
