To help bridge this gap, we developed WaLLM - a\ncustom AI chatbot over WhatsApp, a widely used communication platform in\ndeveloping regions. Beyond answering queries, WaLLM offers several features to\nenhance user engagement: a daily top question, suggested follow-up questions,\ntrending and recent queries, and a leaderboard-based reward system. Our service\nhas been operational for over 6 months, amassing over 14.7K queries from\napproximately 100 users. In this paper, we present WaLLM's design and a\nsystematic analysis of logs to understand user interactions. Our results show\nthat 55% of user queries seek factual information. \"Health and well-being\" was\nthe most popular topic (28%), including queries about nutrition and disease,\nsuggesting users view WaLLM as a reliable source.

Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher\nlogits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the\ncontext prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual\nentrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the\nrelevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the\nsentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a\nnovel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we\nidentify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,\ni.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is\nsignificantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates\nto what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery\nof contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via\nthe entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and\nmitigation of the distraction problem."}

As part of this\nwork, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and\nPairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios.\nAdditionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval\ntasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also\npropose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture.

Investigating the Mechanisms Behind Attacks", "authors": ["Nathalie Kirch", "Constantin Weisser", "Severin Field", "Helen Yannakoudakis", "Stephen Casper"], "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Jailbreaks have been a central focus of research regarding the safety and\nreliability of large language models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms underlying\nthese attacks remain poorly understood. While previous studies have\npredominantly relied on linear methods to detect jailbreak attempts and model\nrefusals, we take a different approach by examining both linear and non-linear\nfeatures in prompts that lead to successful jailbreaks. First, we introduce a\nnovel dataset comprising 10,800 jailbreak attempts spanning 35 diverse attack\nmethods. Leveraging this dataset, we train probes to classify successful from\nunsuccessful jailbreaks using the latent representations corresponding to\nprompt tokens. Notably, we find that even when probes achieve high accuracy in\npredicting the success of jailbreaks, their performance often fails to\ngeneralize to unseen attack methods. This reveals that different jailbreaking\nstrategies exploit different non-linear, non-universal features. Next, we\ndemonstrate that non-linear probes provide a powerful tool for steering model\nbehavior. Specifically, we use these probes to guide targeted latent space\nperturbations, enabling us to effectively modulate the model's robustness\nagainst jailbreaks. Overall, our findings challenge the assumption that\njailbreaks can be fully understood through linear or simple universal prompt\nfeatures alone, highlighting the importance of a nuanced understanding of the\nmechanisms behind LLM vulnerabilities."}

Existing methods for creating Spiking LLMs, i.e., direct\ntraining and ANN-SNN conversion, often suffer from performance degradation and\nrelatively high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel Fast ANN-SNN conversion strategy (FAS) that transforms LLMs into spiking\nLLMs in two stages. The first stage employs a full-parameter fine-tuning of\npre-trained models, so it does not need any direct training from scratch. The\nsecond stage introduces a coarse-to-fine calibration method to reduce\nconversion errors and improve accuracy. Experiments on both language and\nvision-language tasks across four different scales of LLMs demonstrate that FAS\ncan achieve state-of-the-art performance yet with significantly reduced\ninference latency and computational costs. Notably, FAS only takes eight\ntimesteps to achieve an accuracy of 3\\% higher than that of the OPT-7B model,\nwhile reducing energy consumption by 96.63\\%.

In this work, we take one step further to provide a\ncomprehensive analytical emotion framework with multi-aspect emotion detection,\ncontrasting rumour and non-rumour threads and provide both correlation and\ncausal analysis of emotions. We applied our framework on existing widely-used\nrumour datasets to further understand the emotion dynamics in online social\nmedia threads. Our framework reveals that rumours trigger more negative\nemotions (e.g., anger, fear, pessimism), while non-rumours evoke more positive\nones.
