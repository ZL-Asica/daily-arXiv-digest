However, existing methods typically\nrely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific\ntokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,\nwe uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial\ntoken is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model\nbehavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's\nattention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent\ntokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,\nwe find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more\neffectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a\nconsistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but\nvaries across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct\npreferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we\npropose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by\napplying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite\ntuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text\nclassification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across\nmodels such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek.

When Language Models (LMs) are prompted\nwith multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant\ninformation but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information\nsources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the\ncausal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In\nthis paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting\nsearch results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study\nreveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the\nones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in\nMHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order\nof gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned\ndecoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order\naligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models\nwith bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively\nboost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of\nMHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher\nvalues when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to\nheuristically improve LMs' performance on this task.

In modern teleoperation systems, motion retargeting is\nusually implemented through a one time calibration or switching modes. Complex\ntasks, like concatenated screwing, might be difficult, because the operator has\nto align (e.g. mirror) rotational and translational input commands. Recent\nresearch has shown, that the separation of translation and rotation leads to\nincreased task performance. This work proposes a formal motion retargeting\nmethod, which separates translational and rotational input commands.

This study systematically evaluates the impact of\nraster patterns, or spatial arrangements of sequential electrode activation, on\nperformance and perceived difficulty in simulated prosthetic vision (SPV). By\naddressing this gap, we aimed to identify patterns that optimize functional\nvision in retinal implants. Sighted participants completed letter recognition\nand motion discrimination tasks under four raster patterns (horizontal,\nvertical, checkerboard, and random) using an immersive SPV system. The\nsimulations emulated epiretinal implant perception and employed\npsychophysically validated models of electrode activation, phosphene\nappearance, nonlinear spatial summation, and temporal dynamics, ensuring\nrealistic representation of prosthetic vision. Performance accuracy and\nself-reported difficulty were analyzed to assess the effects of raster\npatterning. The checkerboard pattern consistently outperformed other raster\npatterns, yielding significantly higher accuracy and lower difficulty ratings\nacross both tasks. The horizontal and vertical patterns introduced biases\naligned with apparent motion artifacts, while the checkerboard minimized such\neffects.

This approach overcomes\nchallenges from the lack of paired video-ultrasound datasets and the inherent\nheterogeneity between video and ultrasound data.

For computational mappings between form and\nmeaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered\nwords, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between\nthe form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning\nwould be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but\nthere is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test\ndata. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English\ncompounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a\ncomputational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional\nand word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to\nassociate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of\nthe words with a given affix.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and\nspecifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM\ncorpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and\nknowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and\nsystematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally,\nwe establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in\nTCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and\nreal-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant\npotential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research,\nbridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application."}

This can result in biased inferences, where\nplausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.\nMitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness\nand generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical\nconsistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases\non formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a\ncontrolled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from\ncontent plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and\nmaterial inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for\ntest-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs\nreveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over\ncontent biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for\nimproving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control\ncontent effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters\nvia fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is\neffective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in\nformal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).\nFinally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is\nrobust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling\ncapabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning\ntasks.

Token-level\nattribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text\ngeneration, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,\nrather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce\nConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies\nthe concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them\nimportance based on the outputs' semantic similarity.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named\nMiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design\nparadigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov\nDecision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling\nthrough a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.\nOption Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware\nstrategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer\nemploys LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the\nnon-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\\%\ncompetitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual\nmachines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows\nand diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and\nlarge-scale cloud environments."}

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate\nthat these insights will inspire new training strategies and model\narchitectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer\nparameters."}

Supplementary: 1 page", "summary": "Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by\nenabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger\ntarget model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to\nvision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small\nlanguage models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural\ncomponents to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match\nthose of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce\nMultimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of\nVision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models\ninto effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first\nconnects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight\ntrainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning\nusing responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.\nComprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families\ndemonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers\nend-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV\nprovides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both\ncurrent and future VLMs."}

However, noisy preferences in human feedback can lead\nto reward misgeneralization - a phenomenon where reward models learn spurious\ncorrelations or overfit to noisy preferences, which poses important challenges\nto the generalization of RMs. This paper systematically analyzes the\ncharacteristics of preference pairs and aims to identify how noisy preferences\ndiffer from human-aligned preferences in reward modeling. Our analysis reveals\nthat noisy preferences are difficult for RMs to fit, as they cause sharp\ntraining fluctuations and irregular gradient updates. These distinctive\ndynamics suggest the feasibility of identifying and excluding such noisy\npreferences. Empirical studies demonstrate that policy LLM optimized with a\nreward model trained on the full preference dataset, which includes substantial\nnoise, performs worse than the one trained on a subset of exclusively high\nquality preferences. To address this challenge, we propose an online\nCollaborative Reward Modeling (CRM) framework to achieve robust preference\nlearning through peer review and curriculum learning. In particular, CRM\nmaintains two RMs that collaboratively filter potential noisy preferences by\npeer-reviewing each other's data selections. Curriculum learning synchronizes\nthe capabilities of two models, mitigating excessive disparities to promote the\nutility of peer review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRM\nsignificantly enhances RM generalization, with up to 9.94 points improvement on\nRewardBench under an extreme 40\\% noise. Moreover, CRM can seamlessly extend to\nimplicit-reward alignment methods, offering a robust and versatile alignment\nstrategy."}

Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to\nspecific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill\nthese visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model\n(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your\ncomputer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,\ndevice screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that\ncapture user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing\nfor a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or recognize that\na user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft by observing\nmultiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an\narchitecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal\nobservations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously\nrevises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that\nGUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with\ncontext, manage OS notifications to selectively surface important information,\nand enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences across apps. We also\ninstantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover and execute useful\nsuggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our evaluations, we find\nthat GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that\nassistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions that users\nwouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs introduce methods that\nleverage multimodal models to understand unstructured context, enabling\nlong-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive systems that\nanticipate user needs."}

Although\nrecent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing\nperformance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward.\nHowever, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots\noften contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness\nfrequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend\nheavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more\nprevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This\npaper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects\nLLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we\npropose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench),\nwhere we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning\nperformance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that\nmost failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs\nissue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context\ncognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought.\nThis work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction\n(HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert\nusers, e.g., the elderly and children."}
