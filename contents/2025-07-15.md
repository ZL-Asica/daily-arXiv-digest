### [1] [Cognitive Dissonance Artificial Intelligence (CD-AI): The Mind at War with Itself. Harnessing Discomfort to Sharpen Critical Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08804)

*Delia Deliu*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Cognitive Dissonance AI, decision-making, critical thinking, epistemic humility, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI), a framework that promotes engagement with uncertainty and opposing truths to enhance critical thinking and decision-making.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional AI systems that seek to minimize cognitive load and provide certainty, by promoting active struggle and epistemic humility.

**Method:** The paper presents a theoretical foundation for CD-AI and an implementation model, exploring its application across various domains including ethics, law, politics, and science.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI) framework
	2. Emphasis on promoting active engagement with uncertainty
	3. Exploration of ethical implications of sustaining cognitive dissonance in AI applications.

**Result:** CD-AI compels users to navigate contradictions and challenge biases, thus fostering better reflective reasoning and adaptability in complex decision-making scenarios.

**Limitations:** Potential issues include decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, and risks of cognitive manipulation.

**Conclusion:** By advocating for a model of AI that sustains uncertainty rather than resolving it, this work reconceptualizes how AI can facilitate critical thinking and intellectual growth.

**Abstract:** AI-augmented systems are traditionally designed to streamline human decision-making by minimizing cognitive load, clarifying arguments, and optimizing efficiency. However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks becoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth demands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable, perception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty rather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to navigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths. By delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances reflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability in complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of the approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in domains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical concerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive manipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt rather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of AI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the mind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing Huxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI echoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend passive cognition through active epistemic struggle.

**TL;DR:** This study explores the online experiences and risks faced by secondary school adolescents in Nigeria, emphasizing the need for culturally relevant interventions to improve online safety.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Adolescents' increased reliance on online technologies for identity exploration and social connections necessitates understanding their online risks, particularly in underrepresented regions like West Africa.

**Method:** Self-administered surveys were conducted with 409 secondary school adolescents in Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory to examine their technology access, risk exposure, coping strategies, and recommendations for improving online safety.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of adolescents' online safety behaviors through Protection Motivation Theory
	2. Identification of the key stakeholders influencing adolescents' online interactions
	3. Recommendations for improving online safety that cater to cultural contexts

**Result:** Most adolescents had moderate access to technology but reported frequent encounters with risks such as inappropriate content and online scams. The most common coping strategies included blocking and reporting tools, though inaction was also noted due to limited resources.

**Limitations:** The study is geographically limited to Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory and may not represent experiences in other regions.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of culturally and contextually relevant interventions involving parents, educators, and policymakers to enhance online safety for adolescents in Nigeria.

**Abstract:** Adolescents increasingly rely on online technologies to explore their identities, form social connections, and access information and entertainment. However, their growing digital engagement exposes them to significant online risks, particularly in underrepresented contexts like West Africa. This study investigates the online experiences of 409 secondary school adolescents in Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory (FCT), focusing on their access to technology, exposure to risks, coping strategies, key stakeholders influencing their online interactions, and recommendations for improving online safety. Using self-administered surveys, we found that while most adolescents reported moderate access to online technology and connectivity, those who encountered risks frequently reported exposure to inappropriate content and online scams. Blocking and reporting tools were the most commonly used strategies, though some adolescents responded with inaction due to limited resources or awareness. Parents emerged as the primary support network, though monitoring practices and communication varied widely. Guided by Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), our analysis interprets adolescents' online safety behaviors as shaped by both their threat perceptions and their confidence in available coping strategies. A thematic analysis of their recommendations highlights the need for greater awareness and education, parental mediation, enhanced safety tools, stricter age restrictions, improved content moderation, government accountability, and resilience-building initiatives. Our findings underscore the importance of culturally and contextually relevant interventions to empower adolescents in navigating the digital world, with implications for parents, educators, designers, and policymakers.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of autonomous vehicles, understanding how pedestrians perceive these vehicles is crucial for safety and effective communication.

**Method:** The study utilized Unity simulations to assess the visibility of fifteen different vehicle elements from the perspective of a sidewalk pedestrian, considering various factors such as vehicle position, number of vehicles, and visibility distances.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of key vehicle elements visible to pedestrians
	2. Utilization of Unity for vehicle visibility simulations
	3. Provision of insights for future signaling design in autonomous vehicles

**Result:** The research found that pedestrians most frequently see the frontal fenders and headlights of vehicles, while parts like frontal wheels, doors, and mirrors are less visible.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings can inform the design of signaling systems for autonomous vehicles to enhance pedestrian awareness and safety.

**Abstract:** As we move towards a future of autonomous vehicles, questions regarding their method of communication have arisen. One of the common questions concerns the placement of the signaling used to communicate with pedestrians and road users, but little work has been published fully dedicated to exploring this. This paper uses a simulation made in the Unity game engine to record the visibility of fifteen different vehicles, specifically regarding the visibility of frontal elements by a pedestrian on the sidewalk. Variables include the vehicle position, number of vehicles on the road, and minimum and maximum distance of the recorded points. It was concluded that the areas of the vehicle most often seen by pedestrians on the sidewalk attempting to cross the road were the frontal frontal fenders and the headlights, with the frontal wheels, frontal doors, bumper, and side mirrors are less visible alternatives. These findings are valuable in the future design of signaling for autonomous vehicles, in order to ensure pedestrians are able to see them on approaching vehicles. The software used provides a platform for similar works in the future to be conducted.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a system that enables real-time decision-making in doctor-patient conversations by utilizing past health data through a retrieval-based LLM interface.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assist experts in making informed decisions during conversations by leveraging historical data in real-time, especially in healthcare scenarios like doctor-patient interactions.

**Method:** A conversational user interface was developed that listens to conversations, identifies key issues, and retrieves relevant data from an embedded dataset to generate insights using a retrieval-based LLM pipeline.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a conversational system for real-time insights in healthcare
	2. Use of a retrieval-based LLM for generating context-specific information
	3. Evaluation using Health Canada datasets in simulated dialogues

**Result:** Simulations showed that the prototype effectively generated insights for decision-making in simulated doctor-patient dialogues, though challenges were identified.

**Limitations:** Challenges in accurately identifying relevant data and the need for further refinement of the real-time system.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential of real-time data retrieval to support decision-making in healthcare conversations, while also highlighting areas for improvement and future work.

**Abstract:** In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information. This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data? To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting directions for the next steps of our work.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve personal computer security and reduce cognitive burden associated with password authentication.

**Method:** The study evaluates a token-based approach where users confirm authentication requests on their smartphones or smartwatches, comparing button tap and biometric fingerprint verification methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of token-based passwordless authentication utilizing mobile devices.
	2. Comparison of smartwatch and smartphone confirmation methods against traditional passwords in terms of speed and usability.
	3. User study confirming the practicality of smartwatch-based authentication.

**Result:** Smartwatch-based authentication showed superior performance in authentication duration compared to both password-based and smartphone-based methods, with comparable success rates. Usability ratings favored smartwatch-based authentication.

**Limitations:** The study included a small sample size of 30 participants and focused only on specific confirmation methods.

**Conclusion:** The results suggest that utilizing mobile devices for authentication significantly improves the experience and security over traditional password methods.

**Abstract:** Protecting personal computers (PCs) from unauthorized access typically relies on password authentication, which is know to suffer from cognitive burden and weak credentials. As many users nowadays carry mobile devices with advanced security features throughout their day, there is an opportunity to leverage these devices to improve authentication to PCs. In this paper we utilize a token-based passwordless approach where users authenticate to their PC by confirming the authentication request on their smartphones or smartwatches. Upon a request to login to the PC, or to evaluate privileges, the PC issues an authentication request that users receive on their mobile devices, where users can confirm or deny the request. We evaluate button tap and biometric fingerprint verification as confirmation variants, and compare their authentication duration, success rate, and usability to traditional password-based authentication in a user study with 30 participants and a total of 1,200 authentication attempts. Smartwatch-based authentication outperformed password-based authentication and smartphone-based variants in authentication duration, while showing comparable success rates. Participants rated smartwatch-based authentication highest in usability, followed by password-based authentication and smartphone-based authentication.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** mental workload, EEG, self-report, visualization tasks, cognitive processes

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study investigates discrepancies between EEG-based and self-reported mental workload (MW) in visualization tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The accurate assessment of mental workload is essential for understanding cognitive processes, and EEG measures may offer insights beyond self-reports.

**Method:** An experiment was conducted using EEG to assess MW during two benchmark visualization tasks (VLAT and SV), comparing these measures with traditional self-report assessments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated discrepancies between EEG-based and self-reported MW assessments.
	2. Utilized a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture for modeling EEG data.
	3. Highlighted the potential of EEG measures to capture unconscious cognitive effort.

**Result:** Significant discrepancies were found between EEG-based MW estimates and self-reported measures, particularly across varying task difficulty levels, indicating possible unconscious cognitive effort not captured by self-report.

**Limitations:** The study's findings are preliminary and may require further validation with larger participant samples.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that EEG-based assessments may provide a more nuanced understanding of mental workload compared to conventional self-reported methods.

**Abstract:** Accurate assessment of mental workload (MW) is crucial for understanding cognitive processes during visualization tasks. While EEG-based measures are emerging as promising alternatives to conventional assessment techniques, such as selfreport measures, studies examining consistency across these different methodologies are limited. In a preliminary study, we observed indications of potential discrepancies between EEGbased and self-reported MW measures. Motivated by these preliminary observations, our study further explores the discrepancies between EEG-based and self-reported MW assessment methods through an experiment involving visualization tasks. In the experiment, we employ two benchmark tasks: the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) and a Spatial Visualization (SV) task. EEG signals are recorded from participants using a 32-channel system at a sampling rate of 128 Hz during the visualization tasks. For each participant, MW is estimated using an EEG-based model built on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture, and these estimates are compared with conventional MW measures to examine potential discrepancies. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies between task difficulty and EEG-based MW estimates, as well as between EEG-based and self-reported MW measures across varying task difficulty levels. Additionally, the observed patterns suggest the presence of unconscious cognitive effort that may not be captured by selfreport alone.

**Result:** The evaluation through a usage scenario demonstrating Braess's paradox and expert case studies on the Sioux Falls network provided positive feedback on TraSculptor's capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TraSculptor enhances the traffic planning process by allowing for direct modifications and intuitive comparisons, addressing significant limitations in current tools.

**Abstract:** The design of urban road networks significantly influences traffic conditions, underscoring the importance of informed traffic planning. Traffic planning experts rely on specialized platforms to simulate traffic systems, assessing the efficacy of the road network across various states of modifications. Nevertheless, a prevailing issue persists: many existing traffic planning platforms exhibit inefficiencies in flexibly interacting with the road network's structure and attributes and intuitively comparing multiple states during the iterative planning process. This paper introduces TraSculptor, an interactive planning decision-making system. To develop TraSculptor, we identify and address two challenges: interactive modification of road networks and intuitive comparison of multiple network states. For the first challenge, we establish flexible interactions to enable experts to easily and directly modify the road network on the map. For the second challenge, we design a comparison view with a history tree of multiple states and a road-state matrix to facilitate intuitive comparison of road network states. To evaluate TraSculptor, we provided a usage scenario where the Braess's paradox was showcased, invited experts to perform a case study on the Sioux Falls network, and collected expert feedback through interviews.

**Keywords:** Prototyping, Human-Computer Interaction, Disability Studies, Inclusive Design, Visual Culture

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper critiques the visual-centric norms of prototyping in Human-Computer Interaction by exploring the experiences of blind scholars and cultural disability studies, advocating for a broader understanding of design participation beyond sight-based methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To critique the dominance of visual methods in prototyping within HCI and highlight the marginalization of other forms of knowledge and experience.

**Method:** The paper draws insights from cultural disability studies and the lived experiences of blind scholars to analyze existing prototyping practices.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of visual-centric prototyping methods
	2. Inclusion of blind scholars' perspectives
	3. Reframing prototyping as an embodied and relational practice

**Result:** The critique reveals that current prototyping methods privilege visual coherence and exclude diverse modes of knowing, suggesting the need for a more inclusive approach to design.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper calls for HCI to rethink its prototyping practices to include various forms of participation that do not solely depend on visual representations.

**Abstract:** Prototyping is widely regarded in Human-Computer Interaction as an iterative process through which ideas are tested and refined, often via visual mockups, screen flows, and coded simulations. This position paper critiques the visual-centric norms embedded in prototyping culture by drawing from the lived experiences of blind scholars and insights from cultural disability studies. It discusses how dominant methods of prototyping rely on an unexamined fidelity to sight, privileging what can be rendered visibly coherent while marginalizing other modes of knowing and making. By repositioning prototyping as a situated, embodied, and relational practice, this paper challenges HCI to rethink what kinds of design participation are legitimized and which are excluded when prototyping is reduced to screen-based simulations.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** generative AI, end-user programming, education, interactive learning, Chain-of-Abstractions

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework for enhancing programming-by-prompting with generative AI, focusing on maintaining core programming affordances while enabling non-programmers, particularly educators, to create interactive learning content.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Programming-by-prompting with generative AI shifts focus from code fluency to semantic intent, making it accessible for non-programmers like educators. However, it loses important programming features like traceability and testing, necessitating a new approach.

**Method:** The Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework decomposes the synthesis process into sequenced, cognitively meaningful representations, which serve as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement in an authoring environment called SimStep.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework for programming-by-prompting.
	2. Development of the SimStep authoring environment that leverages CoA for educators.
	3. Implementation of intermediate abstractions (Concept Graph, Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, UI Interaction Graph) for enhanced authoring control.

**Result:** Evaluations with educators showed that the CoA framework in SimStep allows for greater authoring control and interpretability when creating simulations compared to traditional programming methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CoA effectively enables educators to create complex interactive learning environments while still maintaining control over essential programming affordances, enhancing the programming-by-prompting experience.

**Abstract:** Programming-by-prompting with generative AI offers a new paradigm for end-user programming, shifting the focus from syntactic fluency to semantic intent. This shift holds particular promise for non-programmers such as educators, who can describe instructional goals in natural language to generate interactive learning content. Yet in bypassing direct code authoring, many of programming's core affordances - such as traceability, stepwise refinement, and behavioral testing - are lost. We propose the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework as a way to recover these affordances while preserving the expressive flexibility of natural language. CoA decomposes the synthesis process into a sequence of cognitively meaningful, task-aligned representations that function as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement. We instantiate this approach in SimStep, an authoring environment for teachers that scaffolds simulation creation through four intermediate abstractions: Concept Graph, Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, and UI Interaction Graph. To address ambiguities and misalignments, SimStep includes an inverse correction process that surfaces in-filled model assumptions and enables targeted revision without requiring users to manipulate code. Evaluations with educators show that CoA enables greater authoring control and interpretability in programming-by-prompting workflows.

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces VolumeSTCube, a novel framework for visualizing large-scale spatial time series data, addressing issues of visual occlusion and depth ambiguity in traditional space-time cube methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for improved visualization techniques for large-scale spatial time series data, as existing methods struggle with integrating temporal and spatial information effectively.

**Method:** The VolumeSTCube framework transforms discrete spatial time series data into continuous volumetric data, utilizing volume and surface rendering techniques to enhance visualization and mitigate occlusion.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the VolumeSTCube framework for spatiotemporal visualization.
	2. Utilization of volume and surface rendering techniques to enhance visualization quality.
	3. Evaluation through expert and user studies demonstrating effectiveness over existing methods.

**Result:** VolumeSTCube was evaluated through computational experiments and user studies, demonstrating superiority in effectiveness for large-scale spatial time series analysis compared to prior approaches.

**Limitations:** The study is primarily focused on specific datasets and may require further validation across diverse spatiotemporal domains.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework offers significant improvements in visualizing large-scale spatial time series data, allowing for better exploration and analysis of spatiotemporal phenomena.

**Abstract:** Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and analytical decision-making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.

**TL;DR:** Branch Explorer transforms 360° videos into accessible branching narratives for blind and low vision users, enhancing engagement through a multi-modal machine learning pipeline.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To support interactive viewing experiences in 360° videos for blind and low vision users who are typically excluded from such experiences.

**Method:** A multi-modal machine learning pipeline generates diverse branching narratives based on viewer choices, complemented by immersive audio guidance for navigation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Transforms 360° video into accessible narratives for BLV users.
	2. Employs machine learning for dynamic story generation.
	3. Evaluates impact on user engagement and agency.

**Result:** Evaluation with 12 blind and low vision viewers showed significant improvements in user agency and engagement, as well as the development of personalized exploration strategies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Branch Explorer effectively enhances accessibility in 360° video content, providing key insights into creating inclusive virtual environments.

**Abstract:** 360{\deg} videos enable users to freely choose their viewing paths, but blind and low vision (BLV) users are often excluded from this interactive experience. To bridge this gap, we present Branch Explorer, a system that transforms 360{\deg} videos into branching narratives -- stories that dynamically unfold based on viewer choices -- to support interactive viewing for BLV audiences. Our formative study identified three key considerations for accessible branching narratives: providing diverse branch options, ensuring coherent story progression, and enabling immersive navigation among branches. To address these needs, Branch Explorer employs a multi-modal machine learning pipeline to generate diverse narrative paths, allowing users to flexibly make choices at detected branching points and seamlessly engage with each storyline through immersive audio guidance. Evaluation with 12 BLV viewers showed that Branch Explorer significantly enhanced user agency and engagement in 360{\deg} video viewing. Users also developed personalized strategies for exploring 360{\deg} content. We further highlight implications for supporting accessible exploration of videos and virtual environments.

**Abstract:** Our society increasingly depends on intelligent systems to solve complex problems, ranging from recommender systems suggesting the next movie to watch to AI models assisting in medical diagnoses for hospitalized patients. With the iterative improvement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI holds significant potential to mitigate medical misdiagnoses by preventing numerous deaths and reducing an economic burden of approximately 450 EUR billion annually. However, a key obstacle to AI adoption lies in the lack of transparency: many automated systems function as "black boxes," providing predictions without revealing the underlying processes. This opacity can hinder experts' ability to trust and rely on AI systems. Visual analytics (VA) provides a compelling solution by combining AI models with interactive visualizations. These specialized charts and graphs empower users to incorporate their domain expertise to refine and improve the models, bridging the gap between AI and human understanding. In this work, we define, categorize, and explore how VA solutions can foster trust across the stages of a typical AI pipeline. We propose a design space for innovative visualizations and present an overview of our previously developed VA dashboards, which support critical tasks within the various pipeline stages, including data processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, understanding, debugging, refining, and comparing models.

Simulating visual impairments is an effective tool for designers, fostering awareness of the challenges faced by VIPs. While previous research has introduced various vision impairment simulators, none have yet been developed with the direct involvement of VIPs or thoroughly evaluated from their perspective. To address this gap, we developed VIP-Sim. This symptom-based vision simulator was created through a participatory design process tailored explicitly for this purpose, involving N=7 VIPs. 21 symptoms, like field loss or light sensitivity, can be overlaid on desktop design tools. Most participants felt VIP-Sim could replicate their symptoms. VIP-Sim was received positively, but concerns about exclusion in design and comprehensiveness of the simulation remain, mainly whether it represents the experiences of other VIPs.

**Conclusion:** The study shows promise for using conversational UIs to improve decision-making in healthcare by integrating relevant past data into real-time interactions, while noting limitations that need addressing.

**Abstract:** In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information. This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data? To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting directions for the next steps of our work.

	2. Multi-head token classification approach for structured data extraction
	3. Effective post-processing method for token merging and layout reconstruction

**Result:** Spatial ModernBERT demonstrates robust performance, effectively leveraging textual and spatial information, as shown through evaluations on financial document extraction tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed model and its post-processing method significantly improve the accuracy of table and key-value extraction in financial documents.

**Abstract:** Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head, classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description, Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices; (3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value extraction in real-world financial documents.

**Conclusion:** SEALGuard significantly enhances safety alignment in LLM systems by effectively addressing the multilingual safety alignment gap.

**Abstract:** Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the potential of self-improving model steering for enhancing inference-time LLM alignment without needing external supervision.

**Abstract:** Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However, conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data, not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

**Conclusion:** The prevalence of stigmatizing language in EHR is influenced by patient demographics and provider types, suggesting a need for awareness and reform in documentation practices.

**Abstract:** Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16), patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46), self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25), with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated by multiple provider types.

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the relationship between individual imagery phenotypes and the nature of visual hallucinations induced by Ganzflicker, utilizing natural language processing to analyze participant descriptions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how differences in the imagery spectrum impact the complexity of internally generated visual experiences during Ganzflicker-induced hallucinations.

**Method:** Analyzed free-text descriptions of hallucinations from over 4,000 participants using natural language processing tools and compared embeddings from vision language models and text-only language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Used large participant pool (over 4,000) to analyze hallucination descriptions.
	2. Showed that imagery phenotypes influence the complexity of visual hallucinations.
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness of vision language models over text-only models in capturing sensory experiences.

**Result:** Strong imagers reported complex, naturalistic content during hallucinations, while weak imagers described simple geometric patterns. Vision language models were better at capturing these differences than text-only models.

**Limitations:** Results may be influenced by self-reporting biases and may not generalize to all types of visual hallucinations.

**Conclusion:** Individual differences in the imagery spectrum may reflect varying coordination between early visual areas and higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:** A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision language models better captured these differences than text-only language models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for the imagery spectrum.

**TL;DR:** Lizard is a linearization framework that transforms LLMs into more efficient architectures for infinite-context generation, overcoming memory and computational challenges of conventional Transformer models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the significant memory and computational bottlenecks in Transformer-based LLMs that arise from quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms, especially at longer context lengths.

**Method:** Lizard introduces a subquadratic attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention while integrating a gating module for adaptive memory control. It combines gated linear attention for global context with sliding window attention, and includes a hardware-aware algorithm to enhance training speed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a subquadratic attention mechanism for LLMs
	2. Incorporation of a gating module for adaptive memory control
	3. Development of a hardware-aware training acceleration algorithm

**Result:** Lizard outperforms previous linearization methods, achieving near-lossless performance recovery of teacher models in language tasks, with an 18-point improvement on the 5-shot MMLU benchmark and enhanced performance in associative recall tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Lizard provides a more efficient architecture for LLMs, achieving both flexibility in design and improved performance, particularly at higher context lengths.

**Abstract:** We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

**Conclusion:** ALIGN is an open-source framework that facilitates research into personalized and reliable LLM decision-making tools.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids. However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key features of our system include robust configuration management, structured output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable, responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed dataset and methodology, with extensions like the LiveCodeBench benchmark aiding in LLM evaluation, particularly for the C++ language.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique. However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale, high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of speech large language models (SLLM) in processing long audio sequences due to context window constraints.

**Method:** The authors propose a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism that encodes sentence-level information and emotions, facilitating the processing of long audio streams by maintaining contextual semantics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) for SLLM
	2. Contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding
	3. Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the IEMOCAP dataset for ERC.

**Result:** The incorporation of DPM into the SLLM framework showed a significant improvement in emotion recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP dataset.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DPM effectively enhances SLLM's ability to recognize emotions in conversations over long durations, overcoming the limitations of traditional input token compression methods.

**Abstract:** Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

**Conclusion:** The advancements made through CompassJudger-2 contribute to more robust and scalable LLM judgment processes and set new standards for model evaluation.

**Abstract:** Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation standards.

**Conclusion:** OPENXRD establishes that AI-generated resources can enhance reasoning in scientific questions and lays groundwork for NLP applications in materials science.

**Abstract:** This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact, domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217 expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models, including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN, under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries, particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The complexity of detecting deception in dialogues due to subtle language nuances and class imbalance between deceptive and truthful messages.

**Method:** A lightweight model combining frozen BERT embeddings with linguistic and game-specific features, alongside a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning objective for improved deception detection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PU-Lie model for deception detection in dialogues
	2. Achievement of a new best macro F1 score of 0.60
	3. Demonstration of the effectiveness of PU learning and linguistic interpretability.

**Result:** PU-Lie achieves a new best macro F1 score of 0.60 while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Properly prioritizing the detection of deception over truthful messages is critical, reflecting the challenges of severe class imbalance in deceptive communication contexts.

**Abstract:** Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings, interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1 of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations. Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital deceptive class.

RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries; (2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

**Keywords:** Large language models, Fine-tuning, Neural network pruning, Generalization, Integrated Gradients

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a fine-tuning method for large language models that improves generalization by pruning neurons responsible for dataset-specific mechanisms, enhancing transferable reasoning capabilities.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To mitigate the issue of large language models relying on dataset-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization to novel tasks and distributions.

**Method:** The proposed method utilizes Integrated Gradients to assess each neuron's impact on predictions, allowing for selective pruning of neurons linked to non-generalizable performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a neuron pruning approach to enhance generalization in LLMs
	2. Application of Integrated Gradients for neuron influence quantification
	3. Demonstration of improved performance over non-pruning methods across multiple benchmarks.

**Result:** The pruning-based fine-tuning approach significantly improves performance on multiple-choice benchmarks compared to previous adaptation methods that do not utilize pruning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Fine-tuning through neuron pruning leads to better generalization and robustness in transformer-based language models, enabling more reliable performance on diverse tasks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** visual metaphors, climate change, environmental communication, human ratings, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 2

**TL;DR:** This study explores the impact of visual metaphors in climate change communication through a novel database of images, revealing their higher cognitive load and aesthetic appreciation compared to literal images.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the communication effectiveness of visual metaphors in climate change and provide a valuable resource for future research.

**Method:** A database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images (MetaClimage) was created, including human ratings for difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal; NLP was used to derive semantic variables from participant-generated tags.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel database for climate change visual metaphors
	2. Insights into cognitive load versus aesthetic appreciation in communication
	3. Evaluation of emotional and semantic dimensions related to visual metaphors

**Result:** Visual metaphors were rated more difficult to understand but more aesthetically pleasing than literal images; they generated more positive and dominant responses but did not differ significantly in efficacy and emotional arousal.

**Limitations:** The study may have limitations due to the subjective nature of human ratings and the specific context of climate change imagery.

**Conclusion:** Visual metaphors present a cost-benefit trade-off in environmental communication, offering aesthetic value and cognitive depth despite a higher cognitive load and similar efficacy to literal images.

**Abstract:** Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material. Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images (MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore, while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when shaping environmental communication.

**Motivation:** The need for effective humour translation across cultures due to the limitations of existing LLMs in rendering humour accurately in translations.

**Method:** A Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) inspired by psychology, utilizing Chain-of-Thought processes to enhance LLMs' translation abilities, particularly in humour.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM)
	2. Utilization of Chain-of-Thought for humour translation
	3. Integration of humour theory into translation processes

**Result:** Experiments show that HDM significantly improves humour translation quality, with gains of 7.75% in humour, 2.81% in fluency, and 6.13% in coherence when compared to prior models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed HDM effectively enhances the readability and humorous elements of translated texts, suggesting a viable approach to improving humour translation in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures, fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper, we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

**Abstract:** Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech, integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1 score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion) for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15 for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and accessibility.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ViSP demonstrates higher-quality sarcastic content generation compared to existing datasets, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

**Abstract:** Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form. Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored, primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation. Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity (0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly available.

**Limitations:** The paper primarily focuses on current methodologies without extensive discussion on implementation challenges or practical applications.

**Conclusion:** The paper provides insights into methods, datasets, challenges, and future directions for more effective and human-centric RAG-Reasoning systems.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

	2. Reinforcement learning to optimize data quality
	3. Demonstrated superior performance over baseline methods

**Result:** The proposed approach shows superior performance on English benchmark datasets for ABSA compared to existing strong baseline methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The use of LLM-based data augmentation significantly enhances the performance of ABSA models by providing more comprehensive training data.

**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment. Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation. LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

**Abstract:** Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities, limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces, enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue, long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underexplored area of long-context referencing in long-context language models (LCLMs).

**Method:** The paper proposes the Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models (Ref-Long), a benchmark requiring LCLMs to identify document indexes related to specific keys, with three subsets created for varied contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Ref-Long benchmark for evaluating long-context referencing in LCLMs.
	2. Identification of significant shortcomings in existing LCLMs regarding long-context referencing tasks.
	3. Comprehensive analyses providing insights into improving LCLM performance on long-context tasks.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate significant deficiencies in long-context referencing abilities, even in top models like GPT-4o, supported by comprehensive analyses including human evaluations and error analyses.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not encompass all contextual nuances and relies on current LCLM capabilities, which are evolving.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for improvement in long-context referencing and provide insights from various experimental adjustments.

**Abstract:** Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models (Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several key insights.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the sensitivity of large language models to errors in user prompts and their impact on machine translation performance.

**Method:** Systematic evaluation of the effects of both humanly plausible and synthetic errors in prompts on LLMs' performance, alongside quantitative and qualitative analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Quantitative and qualitative insights into LLMs' performance under prompt noise
	2. Identification of different types of errors affecting translation differently
	3. Revealing the instruction-following challenges caused by poor prompt quality

**Result:** Prompt quality significantly affects translation performance, with character-level and combined noise types leading to worse outcomes than phrasal perturbations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Low prompt quality hinders instruction following in LLMs and can severely impact translation performance, even though LLMs cope with high levels of random noise better than humans would.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.   The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently, with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

**Result:** NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant shows significant performance improvements, achieving +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS and highlighting tokenizer design's impact on low-resource languages.

**Limitations:** Modest trade-off in general STS performance when optimized for financial semantics.

**Conclusion:** NMIXX and KorFinSTS provide strong tools for multilingual representation learning in finance, addressing the limitations of current models.

**Abstract:** General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.   When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

**Abstract:** We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs. phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology, neuroscience, and education research.

**Conclusion:** The proposed GRPO method offers a resource-efficient solution for boosting the performance of Thai legal LLMs, particularly in handling complex reasoning.

**Abstract:** The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward, significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large language model judges.

**Abstract:** Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs, analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each. We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example, reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing curriculum learning methods rely on fixed difficulty metrics that may not align with the model's perspective. There is a need for a more dynamic approach to assess example difficulty.

**Method:** The authors propose a self-adaptive curriculum learning strategy where difficulty scores are predicted by pre-trained language models. They explore various training methods based on the ordering of examples: easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, and mixed sampling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of self-adaptive difficulty assessments using PLMs.
	2. Comparison of different example ordering strategies in training.
	3. Demonstrated improvement in NLU task performance and training efficiency.

**Result:** The proposed method results in faster convergence and enhanced performance across four NLU datasets compared to traditional random sampling techniques.

**Limitations:** The method's effectiveness may vary based on the choice of pre-trained language model and specific datasets used for evaluation.

**Conclusion:** Self-adaptive curriculum learning can significantly improve NLP model training by leveraging model-driven difficulty assessments, leading to more effective learning.

**Abstract:** Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU) datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

**Motivation:** Current definitions of clickbait lack consensus; there is a need for clarity in what distinguishes clickbait from other information presentation techniques.

**Method:** A new definition of clickbait is proposed focused on curiosity gaps, and a new dataset, TA1C, is created for clickbait detection with clear annotation criteria to minimize subjectivity.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a refined definition of clickbait based on curiosity gaps.
	2. Introduces a new methodology for creating clickbait detection datasets.
	3. Releases the TA1C dataset, the first of its kind for Spanish clickbait detection.

**Limitations:** The focus is on Spanish language data, which may limit applicability to other languages or contexts.

**Conclusion:** This work provides a clearer understanding of clickbait and contributes valuable resources for its detection in Spanish, helping improve the study of clickbait effects.

**Abstract:** We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article. Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of 3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

**Abstract:** Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3, 2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1 function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8 addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

**Motivation:** Traditional chunking strategies for RAG often fail to create meaningful chunks that capture semantic meaning, impacting the effectiveness of external knowledge integration in LLMs.

**Method:** The proposed framework integrates hierarchical text segmentation and clustering methods to generate semantically coherent chunks. It retrieves information using segment-level and cluster-level vector representations during inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	3. Demonstrated effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets

**Result:** Evaluations on the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets show that this method outperforms traditional chunking techniques, leading to improved retrieval accuracy and context relevance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The novel framework provides a significant improvement in RAG systems by enhancing the quality of information retrieval through better chunking strategies.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference, the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

**Abstract:** Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders (OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

**TL;DR:** A novel framework for predicting suicide risk over time by considering both risk and protective factors using a new dataset from Reddit.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in suicide risk prediction models that overlook the dynamic nature of mental state transitions and the importance of protective factors.

**Method:** This study proposes a Protective Factor-Aware Dataset derived from Reddit posts, and a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach to model the interplay between risk and protective factors in predicting suicide risk.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a Protective Factor-Aware Dataset from 12 years of Reddit posts.
	2. Developed a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach for modeling suicide risk transitions.
	3. Provided interpretable weights for clinicians to understand suicidal patterns.

**Result:** The model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and large language models across three datasets, providing interpretable weights for better understanding of suicidal patterns.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating protective factors into suicide risk assessments enhances prediction accuracy and may lead to more effective interventions.

**Abstract:** Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention. Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions. In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone. Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions, recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention strategies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GeLaCo establishes a Pareto frontier for compression and quality, facilitating efficient LLM compression without the need for extensive empirical search.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations. GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

**Motivation:** To evaluate whether AI systems truly represent human values or merely average them, and to address the limitations in current AI alignment approaches.

**Method:** The study utilized the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts to compare the moral intuitions represented by LLMs against human baseline data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of moral representation gaps in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of the homogenizing effect of LLMs on moral diversity
	3. Call for improved alignment metrics in AI systems

**Result:** Results indicate significant gaps between AI-generated moral representations and human moral intuitions, highlighting that larger model sizes do not necessarily increase fidelity in cultural representation.

**Limitations:** Current alignment approaches fail to capture nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions, limiting AI's applicability in diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a critical need for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI accurately reflects diverse human values, rather than oversimplifying them.

**Abstract:** Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT) to enhance reasoning performance by optimizing critical representations in complex reasoning tasks instead of fixed representations.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve performance in complex reasoning tasks while addressing the limitations of the native Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) method, which modifies fixed representations.

**Method:** CRFT identifies and fine-tunes critical representations that integrate information and regulate outputs, operating under a supervised learning framework and optimizing in a low-rank subspace while freezing the base model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces Critical Representation Fine-Tuning method.
	2. Demonstrates significant improvements on reasoning benchmarks.
	3. Highlights the importance of representation-level optimization.

**Result:** CRFT significantly enhances reasoning performance, validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, and improves one-shot accuracy by 16.4%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CRFT offers a lightweight and effective alternative to traditional PEFT methods, emphasizing the importance of representation-level optimization in reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However, directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical representations. These representations either integrate significant information from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework, dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT methods.

**Motivation:** To improve time series forecasting by addressing the limitations of LLMs in modeling continuous numerical data while leveraging their high-level semantic understanding.

**Method:** The proposed architecture integrates representations from LLMs and vanilla Transformers to create a hybrid representation, which captures both historical temporal dynamics and semantic variations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates LLMs with vanilla Transformers for TSF.
	2. Demonstration of improved forecasting accuracy on benchmark datasets.
	3. Analysis of the performance gaps between LLMs and traditional methods in TSF.

**Result:** Experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the model in providing more accurate predictions compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed model successfully fuses LLM capabilities with traditional Transformer strengths, leading to improvements in time series forecasting accuracy.

**Abstract:** Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional feature distillation methods that require teachers and students to share the same hidden sizes, which hinders flexibility.

**Method:** The method identifies the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher model and distills their activations directly to the student model, allowing for different hidden layer dimensions without adding new parameters.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel task-based feature distillation without additional parameters
	2. Identifies task-relevant hidden units for knowledge transfer
	3. Improves performance across multiple downstream tasks

**Result:** Demonstrated consistent improvements in various tasks, achieving up to a 3% performance gain over linear projection baseline methods in classification, instruction-following, and summarization tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method offers a flexible solution for knowledge transfer in LLMs and improves performance on downstream tasks.

**Abstract:** Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification, instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance gain over the linear projection baseline.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Improving prompt engineering for complex tasks with smaller models that are sensitive to prompt design uses a novel evolutionary search technique.

**Method:** The method includes a two-phase approach: (1) grammar-guided genetic programming to create prompt-creating programs, and (2) local search to fine-tune the performance of these programs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a two-phase evolutionary search for prompt optimization
	2. Demonstrates effectiveness on smaller LLMs
	3. Outperforms existing prompt optimization methods in complex tasks.

**Result:** The proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art methods (PromptWizard, OPRO, RL-Prompt) on small general-purpose LLMs across four challenging tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The evolutionary search approach significantly enhances performance in various task-model combinations with minimal degradation in other scenarios.

**Abstract:** Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel regularization technique, Growth Bound Matrices (GBM), to enhance the robustness of NLP models against adversarial attacks, specifically focusing on recurrent networks and state space models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to improve the robustness of NLP models, particularly recurrent networks and state space models, against adversarial attacks, which have been inadequately addressed in prior research.

**Method:** The authors propose a regularization technique called Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) that reduces the impact of input perturbations on model outputs. The technique is evaluated on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models (S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) as a regularization technique.
	2. Systematic analysis of the robustness of State Space models (S4).
	3. Demonstration of improved adversarial robustness across multiple architectures.

**Result:** The method significantly enhances adversarial robustness, achieving up to 8.8% improvement over existing baselines across various architectures and benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate the effectiveness of the GBM approach and its superiority compared to several state-of-the-art methods in defending against adversarial attacks in NLP models.

**Abstract:** Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models (S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4) robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

**Keywords:** large language models, psycholinguistics, affective meaning, valence shifts, LLM collaboration

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in linguistic research, particularly their ability to analyze affective meanings in language and replicate human judgments.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the reliability of LLMs in producing nuanced linguistic analyses alongside human responses in psycholinguistic studies.

**Method:** Four psycholinguistic studies were conducted comparing human judgments and LLM outputs on tasks related to affective meanings, valence shifts, verb choice, and sentence-emoji associations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated strong correlation between human and LLM responses in psycholinguistic tasks.
	2. Validated the use of LLMs as tools for hypothesis generation in linguistic research.
	3. Provided evidence that LLMs can facilitate larger scale linguistic studies.

**Result:** Results indicated a strong correspondence between human and AI responses, with high correlation in both qualitative and quantitative measures, suggesting LLMs can effectively augment traditional linguistic research.

**Limitations:** Minor divergences were observed, but they did not significantly impact overall interpretative outcomes.

**Conclusion:** The findings advocate for the integration of LLMs in linguistic studies, confirming their role as valid partners in research without undermining interpretative validity.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI. Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

**Keywords:** metaphor processing, cognitive science, computational linguistics

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a three-dimensional model of metaphor processing, comparing meaning to an onion, which integrates content analysis, conceptual blending, and pragmatic intentionality for deeper metaphor interpretation in computational systems.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance metaphor interpretation in computational systems by providing a more complex understanding of metaphorical meaning that goes beyond simple surface associations.

**Method:** A stratified model of metaphor processing comprising three levels: content analysis for basic conceptual elements; conceptual blending for emergent meanings; and a pragmatic vocabulary for capturing speaker intent and contextual effects.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-layered metaphor processing model
	2. Integration of pragmatic theories with metaphor understanding
	3. Development of methods for deeper, context-sensitive reasoning in computational interpretations.

**Result:** The proposed model allows for richer metaphor interpretation in computational systems by integrating multiple cognitive levels, providing the groundwork for context-sensitive reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The model offers a formal framework that unifies different layers of metaphor processing, facilitating more advanced computational representations of metaphorical meaning.

**Abstract:** Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2) conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent, communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper, more context-sensitive reasoning.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs), specifically decoder-only Transformers, can understand and extract graph structures from textual data, introducing the Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF) method to analyze internal mechanisms and performance on complex graph tasks.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the capability of decoder-only Transformers in understanding and solving graph reasoning tasks through textual descriptions and to analyze how these models extract substructures from graphs.

**Method:** The paper introduces the concept of Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF) to study substructure extraction in multi-layer transformers, supported by empirical results and theoretical analysis, and tests this method on LLMs to evaluate their performance with attributed graphs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF) method for analyzing Transformers
	2. Empirical and theoretical insights into graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs
	3. Demonstration of successful substructure extraction from attributed graphs

**Result:** The study reveals consistent internal dynamics across transformer layers during the substructure extraction task and demonstrates that decoder-only Transformers can efficiently extract substructures from complex composite patterns, such as molecular graphs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide new insights into the ability of sequence-based Transformers to handle graph data, particularly through effective substructure extraction methods that enhance their application in reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis, we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs. Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** LLMs, clarification questions, task-oriented dialogues, ambiguity, reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the ability of LLMs to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues, especially focusing on ambiguity. It presents a new corpus for experimentation and analyzes the differences between human and LLM responses.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research is motivated by the need to understand how LLMs handle ambiguity in dialogues and their capacity to generate clarification questions compared to humans.

**Method:** The authors create a new corpus by merging two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus, which includes references to ambiguity and clarifications. They compare the instances of clarification questions from LLMs and human responses in ambiguous situations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a new annotated corpus for studying clarification questions in dialogues.
	2. Comparison of human and LLM clarification question generation in ambiguous situations.
	3. Investigation of the correlation between reasoning approaches and LLM question asking frequency.

**Result:** The findings reveal a weak link between ambiguity and human-generated clarification questions, with low correlation between human and LLM question asking. LLMs tend to produce more questions for referential ambiguity but less for task uncertainty compared to humans.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on one corpus, which may limit generalizability to other domains or types of dialogues.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions might depend on their reasoning capabilities, as different reasoning approaches impact the frequency and relevance of these questions.

**Abstract:** In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications -- into a single common format providing the necessary information to experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase question frequency and relevancy.

**Limitations:** The practical implications of findings in diverse contexts remain to be explored.

**Conclusion:** There is a need for further verification of model effectiveness in real-world scenarios to balance hate-speech detection and the preservation of legitimate discourse.

**Abstract:** Online platforms struggle to curb hate speech without over-censoring legitimate discourse. Early bidirectional transformer encoders made big strides, but the arrival of ultra-large autoregressive LLMs promises deeper context-awareness. Whether this extra scale actually improves practical hate-speech detection on real-world text remains unverified. Our study puts this question to the test by benchmarking both model families, classic encoders and next-generation LLMs, on curated corpora of online interactions for hate-speech detection (Hate or No Hate).

**Conclusion:** MLAR can transform recruitment workflows, providing an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution for modern hiring needs.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education, experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400 resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume, reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper analyzes the ability of stylometric metrics to detect AI-generated text from diffusion models compared to autoregressive models, finding that diffusion-generated text closely resembles human text, necessitating new detection methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of large language models, particularly diffusion models, there is a growing concern about detecting AI-generated text reliably. Previous methods for detection may struggle with this new generation of models.

**Method:** The study compares diffusion-generated text using the LLaDA model against autoregressive-generated text from the LLaMA model, analyzing 2,000 samples using various metrics: perplexity, burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First systematic comparison of diffusion and autoregressive models in text generation detection
	2. Identification of key metrics where diffusion models mimic human text
	3. Recommendations for developing better detection methods for diffusion-generated text

**Result:** The results indicate that diffusion-generated text mimics human writing closely, leading to high false-negative rates in existing autoregressive detectors. LLaMA demonstrated lower perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity compared to human text.

**Limitations:** The paper focuses on a limited number of metrics and does not explore all possible detection approaches or fully characterize the detection landscape.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that a single detection metric is insufficient for distinguishing diffusion outputs from human writing and calls for the development of diffusion-aware detection methods such as hybrid models and improved watermarking.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity, burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models, diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the significant computational and memory demands of scaling language models while striving for both parameter sharing and adaptive computation efficiency.

**Method:** MoR combines shared layer stacks and lightweight routers for adaptive token-level recursion, optimizing attention computation and memory access through selective caching of key-value pairs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Unified framework for parameter sharing and adaptive computation
	2. Selective caching of key-value pairs for improved memory efficiency
	3. Demonstrates significant performance improvements in smaller model sizes

**Result:** The MoR framework significantly reduces validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy across various model sizes while achieving higher throughput compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MoR provides a viable solution for achieving large-model quality with reduced resource costs, paving the way for more efficient language model deployment.

**Abstract:** Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of effective benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in coding scenarios despite their potential to assess response quality among models.

**Method:** The authors benchmarked 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models across three coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CodeJudgeBench for LLM performance evaluation in coding tasks.
	2. Demonstration of significant performance variance among LLM-as-a-Judge models.
	3. Identification of effective prompting strategies that enhance judgment accuracy.

**Result:** The study shows that recent thinking models outperform non-thinking ones and that even smaller models can outperform larger, specially trained models, while highlighting issues of randomness and variance in judgments.

**Limitations:** Models exhibit significant randomness and inconsistency in judging coding tasks, raising concerns about reliability.

**Conclusion:** Optimal prompting strategies, such as pair-wise comparisons and retaining full LLM responses, can improve the reliability and performance of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking. However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.

**TL;DR:** REST is a stress-testing framework for evaluating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) under multi-context pressure, revealing performance degradations that conventional benchmarks do not capture.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address limitations in existing evaluation methods for LRMs that focus on single-question reasoning and require constant question generation.

**Method:** REST concurrently exposes models to multiple problems, evaluating contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and cognitive load management.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of REST as a new evaluation framework for LRMs
	2. Revealing performance differences among models previously considered similar
	3. Insights into the impact of training techniques on model performance under stress testing.

**Result:** REST's evaluation highlights performance degradation of state-of-the-art models under stress, demonstrating stronger discriminative power than traditional benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The framework's effectiveness may vary depending on the specific characteristics of different models and their training procedures.

**Conclusion:** REST is positioned as a cost-efficient and reliable evaluation method that reflects the complexities of real-world reasoning tasks, reducing the need for continuous human question generation.

**Abstract:** Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human annotation.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to sample prompts from a vast array of annotated examples can lead to high annotation costs, necessitating an efficient approach to select valuable examples.

**Method:** A directed graph is constructed to represent unlabeled data and the influence of candidate subsets is quantified using a diffusion process. An iterative greedy algorithm is used for the selection of unlabeled data based on maximum marginal gain.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an influence-driven method for selective annotation
	2. Utilization of a directed graph and diffusion process for influence quantification
	3. A greedy algorithm that optimally selects pivotal unlabeled data subsets

**Result:** Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing selective annotation techniques in terms of performance and efficiency, achieving better results with lower time consumption.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The influence-driven approach offers an end-to-end solution for selecting unlabeled data subsets, balancing the need for diversity and representativeness theoretically and practically.

**Abstract:** In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influence-driven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

**Motivation:** To improve the effectiveness of neural topic models by resolving contradictions between evidence lower bound (ELBO) and contrastive learning objectives for better topic representation.

**Method:** Introduces a contrastive learning method for sets of topic vectors and formulates contrastive topic modeling as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming for a Pareto stationary solution.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel contrastive learning method focused on topic vectors
	2. Multi-objective optimization formulation for contrastive topic modeling
	3. Demonstrated improvement in topic coherence and diversity

**Result:** The proposed framework yields neural topic models with improved topic coherence, diversity, and overall performance in downstream tasks compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address specific computational efficiency or scalability issues of the proposed method.

**Conclusion:** The new approach effectively balances ELBO and contrastive objectives, enhancing the quality of topic modeling.

**Abstract:** Recent representation learning approaches enhance neural topic models by optimizing the weighted linear combination of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood and the contrastive learning objective that contrasts pairs of input documents. However, document-level contrastive learning might capture low-level mutual information, such as word ratio, which disturbs topic modeling. Moreover, there is a potential conflict between the ELBO loss that memorizes input details for better reconstruction quality, and the contrastive loss which attempts to learn topic representations that generalize among input documents. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel contrastive learning method oriented towards sets of topic vectors to capture useful semantics that are shared among a set of input documents. Secondly, we explicitly cast contrastive topic modeling as a gradient-based multi-objective optimization problem, with the goal of achieving a Pareto stationary solution that balances the trade-off between the ELBO and the contrastive objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently produces higher-performing neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, topic diversity, and downstream performance.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The task of designing optimal prompts for LLMs is complex and often results in suboptimal performance due to its separation of prompt instructions and in-context examples.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed SEE framework effectively addresses the challenges of prompt optimization in LLMs, leading to improved performance and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Designing optimal prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a complicated and resource-intensive task, often requiring substantial human expertise and effort. Existing approaches typically separate the optimization of prompt instructions and in-context learning examples, leading to incohesive prompts that are defined and represented by suboptimal task performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Cohesive In-Context Prompt Optimization framework that refines both prompt instructions and examples. However, formulating such an optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional space of natural language poses significant challenges in both convergence and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SEE, a scalable and efficient prompt optimization framework that adopts metaheuristic optimization principles and strategically balances exploration and exploitation to enhance optimization performance and achieve efficient convergence. SEE features a quad-phased design that alternates between global traversal (exploration) and local optimization (exploitation) and adaptively chooses LLM operators during the optimization process. We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation across 35 benchmark tasks, and SEE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin, achieving an average performance gain of 13.94 while reducing computational costs by 58.67.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Language Models, Supervised Fine-Tuning, Preference Optimization, Human Preferences, Markov Decision Process

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Introducing Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT), a novel approach that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) to enhance language model alignment with human preferences.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for aligning language models often separate SFT and PO, not leveraging the strengths of both. This paper seeks to bridge that gap.

**Method:** The paper models SFT and PO as two subprocesses in a Markov Decision Process framework, leading to the development of Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT), which integrates SFT and PO into a single process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT) that integrates SFT and PO.
	2. Modeling SFT and PO as subprocesses within an MDP framework.
	3. Demonstration of IFT's superior performance in various language generation tasks.

**Result:** IFT shows performance comparable or superior to SFT and common PO methods across multiple tasks, especially in generation, reasoning, and fact-following scenarios.

**Limitations:** IFT relies on a single policy and requires the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT, which could be limiting in certain contexts.

**Conclusion:** IFT offers a new way to improve language models by better estimating and optimizing preferences using a unified approach, while relying on the same data volume as SFT.

**Abstract:** Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) are key processes for aligning Language Models (LMs) with human preferences post pre-training. While SFT excels in efficiency and PO in effectiveness, they are often combined sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives. This approach ignores the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. In this paper, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes -- Preference Estimation and Transition Optimization -- defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This modeling shows that SFT is only a special case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO estimates the model's preference by its entire generation, while SFT only scores model's subsequent predicted tokens based on prior tokens from ground truth answer. These priors deviates from model's distribution, hindering the preference estimation and transition optimization. Building on this view, we introduce Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT) to integrate SFT and PO into a single process. Through a temporal residual connection, IFT brings better estimation and optimization by capturing LMs' intuitive sense of its entire answers. But it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs comparably or even superiorly to SFT and some typical PO methods across several tasks, particularly those require generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities. An explainable Frozen Lake game further validates the effectiveness of IFT for getting competitive policy.

**Motivation:** To explore the application of generative language models in social sciences and their alignment with human-like responses in political contexts, particularly addressing the gaps in their use for out-of-domain tasks.

**Method:** The study adapts open-source generative language models to vary by political personas and generates synthetic datasets through repeated surveys, analyzing the results against psychological data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of generative language models in social science applications
	2. Analysis of model-persona combinations and their inconsistencies
	3. Identification of weak correlation between synthetic and human data

**Result:** The analysis revealed high response variance and weak correlation between synthetic model outputs and real human data, especially for conservative persona models, indicating challenges in ideological representation through language models.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by the scope of political personas selected and the inherent challenges in modeling complex human ideologies accurately with current techniques.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the need for improvements in in-context optimization of generative language models to better represent psychological and sociological ideologies in simulated social interactions.

**Abstract:** Contemporary research in social sciences increasingly utilizes state-of-the-art generative language models to annotate or generate content. While these models achieve benchmark-leading performance on common language tasks, their application to novel out-of-domain tasks remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we investigate how personalized language models align with human responses on the Moral Foundation Theory Questionnaire. We adapt open-source generative language models to different political personas and repeatedly survey these models to generate synthetic data sets where model-persona combinations define our sub-populations. Our analysis reveals that models produce inconsistent results across multiple repetitions, yielding high response variance. Furthermore, the alignment between synthetic data and corresponding human data from psychological studies shows a weak correlation, with conservative persona-prompted models particularly failing to align with actual conservative populations. These results suggest that language models struggle to coherently represent ideologies through in-context prompting due to their alignment process. Thus, using language models to simulate social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes properly.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CV-Probes dataset

**Result:** VL models perform poorly in grounding context-dependent verb phrases. The analysis reveals insufficient attention to verb tokens in captions, indicating a gap in current model capabilities.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on specific social and visual contexts; broader applicability remains to be tested.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the necessity for improved methodologies in training and evaluating vision-language models, particularly for context-sensitive tasks.

**Abstract:** How do vision-language (VL) transformer models ground verb phrases and do they integrate contextual and world knowledge in this process? We introduce the CV-Probes dataset, containing image-caption pairs involving verb phrases that require both social knowledge and visual context to interpret (e.g., "beg"), as well as pairs involving verb phrases that can be grounded based on information directly available in the image (e.g., "sit"). We show that VL models struggle to ground VPs that are strongly context-dependent. Further analysis using explainable AI techniques shows that such models may not pay sufficient attention to the verb token in the captions. Our results suggest a need for improved methodologies in VL model training and evaluation. The code and dataset will be available https://github.com/ivana-13/CV-Probes.

**Abstract:** Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 3,576 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv, GitHub, and Zenodo. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the verifiability of model outputs in RAG, this study investigates attribution sensitivity and bias regarding authorship.

**Method:** An experimental setup was designed using counterfactual evaluation to assess three large language models on their attribution sensitivity and biases when provided with authorship information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the concepts of attribution sensitivity and bias in LLMs for RAG.
	2. Demonstration of how authorship affects attribution quality and biases in LLM outputs.
	3. Highlighting the implications of document metadata on the reliability of LLM-generated answers.

**Result:** Results indicate that including authorship information can alter attribution quality by 3% to 18%, with evidence of a bias towards human-written documents.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on specific LLMs and may not generalize to all models or domains.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that source document metadata influences LLMs' trust and attribution quality, revealing new dimensions of brittleness in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Attributing answers to source documents is an approach used to enhance the verifiability of a model's output in retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Prior work has mainly focused on improving and evaluating the attribution quality of large language models (LLMs) in RAG, but this may come at the expense of inducing biases in the attribution of answers. We define and examine two aspects in the evaluation of LLMs in RAG pipelines, namely attribution sensitivity and bias with respect to authorship information. We explicitly inform an LLM about the authors of source documents, instruct it to attribute its answers, and analyze (i) how sensitive the LLM's output is to the author of source documents, and (ii) whether the LLM exhibits a bias towards human-written or AI-generated source documents. We design an experimental setup in which we use counterfactual evaluation to study three LLMs in terms of their attribution sensitivity and bias in RAG pipelines. Our results show that adding authorship information to source documents can significantly change the attribution quality of LLMs by 3% to 18%. Moreover, we show that LLMs can have an attribution bias towards explicit human authorship, which can serve as a competing hypothesis for findings of prior work that shows that LLM-generated content may be preferred over human-written contents. Our findings indicate that metadata of source documents can influence LLMs' trust, and how they attribute their answers. Furthermore, our research highlights attribution bias and sensitivity as a novel aspect of brittleness in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel neurolinguistic approach for assessing LLMs
	2. Identified distinct differences between language performance and competence

**Result:** The study found that performance and competence in language tasks are distinct; probability measurements do not accurately reflect competence; instruction tuning improves performance without altering competence; LLMs show better competence in form compared to meaning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of new datasets for Chinese and German provides additional resources for evaluating LLMs' linguistic abilities across languages.

**Abstract:** This study investigates the linguistic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding signifier (form) and signified (meaning) by distinguishing two LLM assessment paradigms: psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic. Traditional psycholinguistic evaluations often reflect statistical rules that may not accurately represent LLMs' true linguistic competence. We introduce a neurolinguistic approach, utilizing a novel method that combines minimal pair and diagnostic probing to analyze activation patterns across model layers. This method allows for a detailed examination of how LLMs represent form and meaning, and whether these representations are consistent across languages. We found: (1) Psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic methods reveal that language performance and competence are distinct; (2) Direct probability measurement may not accurately assess linguistic competence; (3) Instruction tuning won't change much competence but improve performance; (4) LLMs exhibit higher competence and performance in form compared to meaning. Additionally, we introduce new conceptual minimal pair datasets for Chinese (COMPS-ZH) and German (COMPS-DE), complementing existing English datasets.

**Motivation:** The rising demand for LLM inference systems and the inefficiencies of current caching methods necessitate improved caching techniques.

**Method:** InstCache reorders the representation space of instruction texts to enhance spatial locality for better prediction of instruction-response pairs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of InstCache for predictive instruction-response caching
	2. Achieving higher hit rates compared to traditional methods
	3. Demonstrating significant reductions in computation time per token

**Result:** InstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate over traditional caching mechanisms and significantly reduces the output token computation time by up to 50% on certain datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** InstCache provides an effective solution for improving caching efficiency in LLM inference systems, leading to lower computation times and higher hit rates.

**Abstract:** The revolutionary capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting rapidly growing popularity and leading to soaring user requests to inference serving systems. Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce computation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference engines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the token level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request volume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full instruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role. However, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it rare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting challenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this challenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving systems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the representation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of spatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential instructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an effective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that InstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of traditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per output token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets, respectively.

**Motivation:** To analyze the geometric perception abilities of LVLMs, which remain insufficiently explored despite their success in vision-language tasks.

**Method:** Introducing VisOnlyQA, a dataset composed of 12 tasks focusing on geometric information in images, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes to benchmark LVLMs' geometric perception.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the VisOnlyQA dataset for evaluating LVLMs
	2. Demonstration of significant performance gaps in LVLMs compared to humans in geometric perception tasks
	3. Insight into the limitations of current LVLM architectures in processing geometric information.

**Result:** The paper finds that state-of-the-art LVLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro, struggle significantly with geometric perception tasks, highlighting gaps in their visual understanding abilities.

**Limitations:** The dataset's effectiveness in improving LVLM performance through fine-tuning is inconsistent, and there may be inherent limitations in LVLM architecture.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that the current LVLMs' performance issues may stem from the way they process information rather than a lack of data, indicating that leveraging stronger underlying LLMs could improve geometric perception in LVLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various vision-language tasks. However, it is still unclear how accurately LVLMs can perceive visual information in images. In particular, the capability of LVLMs to perceive geometric information, such as shape, angle, and size, remains insufficiently analyzed, although the perception of these properties is crucial for tasks that require a detailed visual understanding. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a dataset for evaluating the geometric perception of LVLMs, and reveal that LVLMs often cannot accurately perceive basic geometric information in images, while human performance is nearly perfect. VisOnlyQA consists of 12 tasks that directly ask about geometric information in geometric shapes, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes. Our experiments highlight the following findings: (i) State-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with basic geometric perception. 23 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro, work poorly on VisOnlyQA. (ii) Additional training data does not resolve this issue. Fine-tuning on the training set of VisOnlyQA is not always effective, even for in-distribution tasks. (iii) LLM may be the bottleneck. LVLMs using stronger LLMs exhibit better geometric perception on VisOnlyQA, while it does not require complex reasoning, suggesting that the way LVLMs process information from visual encoders is a bottleneck. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA.

**Conclusion:** BEExformer offers a Pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off, suitable for constrained environments, enhancing the usability of transformer models.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements hinder deployment on constrained resources. To enhance efficiency, binarization and Early Exit (EE) have proved to be effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss as reduced precision affects gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, research on EE mechanisms is still in its early stages. To address these challenges, we introduce Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning-based transformer integrating Binarization-Aware Training (BAT) with EE for efficient and fast textual inference. Each transformer block has an integrated Selective-Learn Forget Network (SLFN) to enhance contextual retention while eliminating irrelevant information. The BAT employs a differentiable second-order approximation to the sign function, enabling gradient computation that captures both the sign and magnitude of the weights. This aids in 21.30 times reduction in model size. The EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. This accelerates inference by reducing FLOPs by 52.08% and even improves accuracy by 2.89% by resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Extensive evaluation through comparison with the SOTA methods and various ablations across six datasets covering multiple NLP tasks demonstrates its Pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), a method for detecting AI-generated content leveraging LLM next-token distribution metrics and last hidden states to improve performance while reducing resource requirements.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rise of large language models has led to concerns about AI content misuse, necessitating effective detection methods, especially in unfamiliar domains.

**Method:** The proposed PAWN employs attention weights on next-token distribution metrics to aggregate predictions more effectively, caching relevant data to lower training costs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN) for detection of AI-generated content
	2. Improved aggregation of next-token predictions through attention weighting
	3. Demonstrated superior performance with reduced parameter requirements compared to fine-tuned LMs

**Result:** PAWN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, showing better performance in-distribution with fewer trainable parameters and improved generalization to unseen domains.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PAWN enhances detection capabilities for AI-generated text, maintaining robustness against adversarial attacks and showing effective multilingual generalization.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

**TL;DR:** ACEBench is a new benchmark for evaluating tool usage in Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing limitations in existing evaluation methods.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks for LLMs' tool usage are inadequate in evaluating real multi-turn dialogue contexts, assessment dimensions, and the overhead of relying on LLMs or real API executions.

**Method:** ACEBench categorizes evaluation data into three types: Normal (basic scenarios), Special (ambiguous/incomplete instructions), and Agent (multi-agent interactions), to assess tool usage more comprehensively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ACEBench framework for tool usage evaluation
	2. Categorization of evaluation scenarios into Normal, Special, and Agent
	3. Granular analysis of error causes in LLMs' tool usage

**Result:** Extensive experiments with ACEBench allowed for in-depth analysis of various LLMs and provided insights into error causes across different evaluation scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ACEBench offers a robust framework for evaluating LLMs' tool usage, allowing for better assessments of their decision-making and reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, particularly when integrated with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** prompt caching, large language models, privacy leakage, timing attacks, API security

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the implications of prompt caching in large language models (LLMs), revealing timing variations that may lead to privacy issues, including potential side-channel attacks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the risks posed by prompt caching in LLMs, especially in terms of privacy and information leakage.

**Method:** The authors conducted statistical audits on real-world LLM API providers to detect prompt caching behavior.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Detection of global prompt caching across multiple API providers
	2. Evidence of potential privacy leakage in LLM interactions
	3. Insights into model architecture obtained through timing analysis

**Result:** The study found evidence of global cache sharing across seven API providers, including OpenAI, leading to potential privacy leakage and insights into model architecture.

**Limitations:** The study may not cover all API providers and caching behaviors, and results may vary over time with new updates from providers.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for increased transparency from API providers regarding their caching policies to protect user privacy.

**Abstract:** Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

**Motivation:** To improve explainability and human interpretability in language models, which often struggle with post-hoc explanation methods.

**Method:** The authors introduce B-cos language models by applying B-cos conversion to pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, leading to enhanced explanation quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of B-cos LMs for natural language processing tasks

	3. Exploration of transforming decoder-only models into B-cos LMs for generation tasks.

**Result:** B-cos LMs yielded more faithful and interpretable explanations than traditional post-hoc methods, with task performance on par with conventional fine-tuning approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** B-cos LMs represent a promising step towards improving model interpretability in NLP, particularly for generating explanations and enhancing user interactions.

**Abstract:** Post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models often struggle with faithfulness and human interpretability due to the lack of explainability in current neural architectures. Meanwhile, B-cos networks have been introduced to improve model explainability by proposing an architecture that removes bias terms and promotes input-weight alignment. Although B-cos networks have shown success in building explainable systems, their application has so far been limited to computer vision models and their associated training pipelines. In this work, we introduce B-cos LMs, i.e., B-cos language models (LMs) empowered for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our approach directly transforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos conversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous methods. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that B-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post-hoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional fine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from conventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation patterns. Finally, we are also the first to explore the transformation of decoder-only models to B-cos LMs for generation tasks.

**Motivation:** To address the lack of bilingual context in safety evaluations of large language models, particularly in regions where multiple languages are spoken.

**Method:** Development and experimentation with the Qorgau dataset, focusing on safety evaluation of language-specific and multilingual LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Qorgau dataset for bilingual safety evaluation
	2. Demonstration of significant differences in LLM safety performance across languages
	3. Highlighting the necessity for tailored datasets in multilingual contexts.

**Result:** Findings indicate significant differences in LLM safety performance between Kazakh and Russian, highlighting the need for tailored datasets.

**Limitations:** The dataset may contain offensive or harmful example data.

**Conclusion:** The study advocates for the creation of region-specific datasets to ensure responsible use of LLMs in multilingual settings.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are known to have the potential to generate harmful content, posing risks to users. While significant progress has been made in developing taxonomies for LLM risks and safety evaluation prompts, most studies have focused on monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, language- and region-specific risks in bilingual contexts are often overlooked, and core findings can diverge from those in monolingual settings. In this paper, we introduce Qorgau, a novel dataset specifically designed for safety evaluation in Kazakh and Russian, reflecting the unique bilingual context in Kazakhstan, where both Kazakh (a low-resource language) and Russian (a high-resource language) are spoken. Experiments with both multilingual and language-specific LLMs reveal notable differences in safety performance, emphasizing the need for tailored, region-specific datasets to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in countries like Kazakhstan. Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive, harmful, or biased.

**Result:** The approach enhances interpretation coverage and generalizes effectively across various datasets with different annotation styles, database structures, and types of ambiguity.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This modular method provides a more robust framework for handling ambiguity in natural language interfaces, leading to improved performance in semantic parsing tasks.

**Abstract:** Handling ambiguity and underspecification is an important challenge in natural language interfaces, particularly for tasks like text-to-SQL semantic parsing. We propose a modular approach that resolves ambiguity using natural language interpretations before mapping these to logical forms (e.g., SQL queries). Although LLMs excel at parsing unambiguous utterances, they show strong biases for ambiguous ones, typically predicting only preferred interpretations. We constructively exploit this bias to generate an initial set of preferred disambiguations and then apply a specialized infilling model to identify and generate missing interpretations. To train the infilling model, we introduce an annotation method that uses SQL execution to validate different meanings. Our approach improves interpretation coverage and generalizes across datasets with different annotation styles, database structures, and ambiguity types.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Language Models have led to remarkable achievements across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, making prompt engineering increasingly central to guiding model outputs. While manual methods can be effective, they typically rely on intuition and do not automatically refine prompts over time. In contrast, automatic prompt optimization employing heuristic-based search algorithms can systematically explore and improve prompts with minimal human oversight. This survey proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of these methods, categorizing them by where optimization occurs, what is optimized, what criteria drive the optimization, which operators generate new prompts, and which iterative search algorithms are applied. We further highlight specialized datasets and tools that support and accelerate automated prompt refinement. We conclude by discussing key open challenges pointing toward future opportunities for more robust and versatile LLM applications.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing text-to-SQL approaches, particularly regarding dependency on closed-source LLMs and poor generalizability of fine-tuning methods.

**Method:** A novel data synthesis framework for automatically generating a large-scale, diverse text-to-SQL dataset, resulting in the SynSQL-2.5M dataset with 2.5 million samples from synthetic databases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a scalable text-to-SQL data synthesis framework
	2. Creation of SynSQL-2.5M, a million-scale text-to-SQL dataset
	3. Development of OmniSQL, an open-source model with state-of-the-art performance

**Result:** OmniSQL outperforms leading closed-source and open-source LLMs in text-to-SQL performance on multiple benchmarks, despite being smaller in size.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework and model pave the way for further research and development in the field of text-to-SQL applications.

**Abstract:** Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, plays a crucial role in enabling non-experts to interact with databases. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text-to-SQL performance, existing approaches face notable limitations in real-world text-to-SQL applications. Prompting-based methods often depend on closed-source LLMs, which are expensive, raise privacy concerns, and lack customization. Fine-tuning-based methods, on the other hand, suffer from poor generalizability due to the limited coverage of publicly available training data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and scalable text-to-SQL data synthesis framework for automatically synthesizing large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets without extensive human intervention. Using this framework, we introduce SynSQL-2.5M, the first million-scale text-to-SQL dataset, containing 2.5 million samples spanning over 16,000 synthetic databases. Each sample includes a database, SQL query, natural language question, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solution. Leveraging SynSQL-2.5M, we develop OmniSQL, a powerful open-source text-to-SQL model available in three sizes: 7B, 14B, and 32B. Extensive evaluations across nine datasets demonstrate that OmniSQL achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or surpassing leading closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, despite its smaller size. We release all code, datasets, and models to support further research.

**Motivation:** Understanding the causes of hallucinations in LLMs is essential for improving reliable content generation.

**Method:** The study utilizes the open-source OLMo series and Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies, constructing probing datasets from relational facts in Wikidata5M to examine the effect of subject and object frequencies on model performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Linking LLM hallucinations to pre-training data characteristics
	2. Demonstrating the asymmetry in recognition of logical equivalence based on entity frequency
	3. Providing insights for inferring pre-training dataset characteristics in LLMs.

**Result:** Experiments show that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognized than their inverse, and patterns change based on frequency settings.

**Limitations:** Limited to analysis of entity frequencies and their effects on recognition, does not address all aspects of hallucinations.

**Conclusion:** Findings underline the impact of pre-training data composition on LLM predictions, with potential implications for developing more reliable models.

**Abstract:** Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliable content generation. While previous research has primarily focused on "when" LLMs hallucinate, our work explains "why" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, we demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source OLMo series by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from Wikidata5M, we construct probing datasets to isolate this effect. Our experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency. These findings highlight the influential role of pre-training data in shaping model predictions and provide insights for inferring the characteristics of pre-training data in closed or partially closed LLMs.

**Abstract:** Social bias in language models can potentially exacerbate social inequalities. Despite it having garnered wide attention, most research focuses on English data. In a low-resource scenario, the models often perform worse due to insufficient training data. This study aims to leverage high-resource language corpora to evaluate bias and experiment with debiasing methods in low-resource languages. We evaluated the performance of recent multilingual models in five languages: English, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian and Thai, and analyzed four bias dimensions: gender, religion, nationality, and race-color. By constructing multilingual bias evaluation datasets, this study allows fair comparisons between models across languages. We have further investigated three debiasing methods-CDA, Dropout, SenDeb-and demonstrated that debiasing methods from high-resource languages can be effectively transferred to low-resource ones, providing actionable insights for fairness research in multilingual NLP.
