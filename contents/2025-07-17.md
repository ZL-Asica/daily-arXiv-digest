**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Interactive storytelling, AI authoring, Narrative planning, Human-computer interaction, Everyday storytelling

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** DiaryPlay is an AI-assisted system that simplifies the creation of interactive vignettes for everyday storytelling by extracting core elements from natural language stories.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the potential of interactive vignettes to enhance storytelling, their complexity hinders everyday authors from using them. DiaryPlay aims to streamline the authoring process.

**Method:** DiaryPlay takes a natural language story and extracts the core elements (environment, characters, events) necessary for crafting an interactive vignette. It then uses an LLM-based narrative planner to convert a single-branch story into a branch-and-bottleneck narrative structure.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an AI-assisted authoring system for interactive vignettes.
	2. Use of LLM for narrative planning to facilitate branching story development.
	3. Empirical evaluations of character believability and author support.

**Result:** Technical evaluations demonstrate that the character activities generated by DiaryPlay are perceived as believable as those authored by humans. User studies indicate that the system effectively assists authors and provides engaging experiences.

**Limitations:** Limited to a small number of participants in evaluations.

**Conclusion:** DiaryPlay enables authors to focus on refining their interactive vignettes while ensuring quality viewer interaction and maintaining authorial intent.

**Abstract:** An interactive vignette is a popular and immersive visual storytelling approach that invites viewers to role-play a character and influences the narrative in an interactive environment. However, it has not been widely used by everyday storytellers yet due to authoring complexity, which conflicts with the immediacy of everyday storytelling. We introduce DiaryPlay, an AI-assisted authoring system for interactive vignette creation in everyday storytelling. It takes a natural language story as input and extracts the three core elements of an interactive vignette (environment, characters, and events), enabling authors to focus on refining these elements instead of constructing them from scratch. Then, it automatically transforms the single-branch story input into a branch-and-bottleneck structure using an LLM-powered narrative planner, which enables flexible viewer interactions while freeing the author from multi-branching. A technical evaluation (N=16) shows that DiaryPlay-generated character activities are on par with human-authored ones regarding believability. A user study (N=16) shows that DiaryPlay effectively supports authors in creating interactive vignette elements, maintains authorial intent while reacting to viewer interactions, and provides engaging viewing experiences.

**Abstract:** Communicating climate change remains challenging, as climate reports, though rich in data and visualizations, often feel too abstract or technical for the public. Although personalization can enhance communication, most tools still lack the narrative and visualization tailoring needed to connect with individual experiences. We present CLAImate, an AI-enabled prototype that personalizes conversation narratives and localizes visualizations based on users' climate knowledge and geographic location. We evaluated CLAImate through internal verification of factual correctness, a formative study with experts, and a pilot with UK residents. CLAImate achieved 66% SNLI accuracy and 70% FACTSCORE. Visualization experts appreciated its clarity and personalization, and seven out of ten UK participants reported better understanding and local relevance of climate risks with CLAImate. We also discuss design challenges in personalization, accuracy, and scalability, and outline future directions for integrating visualizations in personalized conversational interfaces.

	2. Evaluation through human subjects study confirming the validity of the approach.
	3. Insight into the dynamics of team interactions during collaborative tasks.

**Result:** The study with 48 participants demonstrated strong correlations between behavior modes and shifts in interaction network structure.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GIST effectively captures and analyzes multi-modal interaction data, providing insights into team dynamics in MR environments.

**Abstract:** Understanding how teams coordinate, share work, and negotiate roles in immersive environments is critical for designing effective mixed-reality (MR) applications that support real-time collaboration. However, existing methods either rely on external cameras and offline annotation or focus narrowly on single modalities, limiting their validity and applicability. To address this, we present a novel group interaction sensing toolkit (GIST), a deployable system that passively captures multi-modal interaction data, such as speech, gaze, and spatial proximity from commodity MR headset's sensors and automatically derives both overall static interaction networks and dynamic moment-by-moment behavior patterns. We evaluate GIST with a human subject study with 48 participants across 12 four-person groups performing an open-ended image-sorting task in MR. Our analysis shows strong alignment between the identified behavior modes and shifts in interaction network structure, confirming that momentary changes in speech, gaze, and proximity data are observable through the sensor data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper extends existing frameworks to include geographic specificity, offering examples and guiding future research in affective geovisualization.

**Abstract:** Affective visualization design is an emerging research direction focused on communicating and influencing emotion through visualization. However, as revealed by previous research, this area is highly interdisciplinary and involves theories and practices from diverse fields and disciplines, thus awaiting analysis from more fine-grained angles. To address this need, this work focuses on a pioneering and relatively mature sub-area, affective geovisualization design, to further the research in this direction and provide more domain-specific insights. Through an analysis of a curated corpus of affective geovisualization designs using the Person-Process-Place (PPP) model from geographic theory, we derived a design taxonomy that characterizes a variety of methods for eliciting and enhancing emotions through geographic visualization. We also identified four underlying high-level design paradigms of affective geovisualization design (e.g., computational, anthropomorphic) that guide distinct approaches to linking geographic information with human experience. By extending existing affective visualization design frameworks with geographic specificity, we provide additional design examples, domain-specific analyses, and insights to guide future research and practices in this underexplored yet highly innovative domain.

### [6] [Interactive Hybrid Rice Breeding with Parametric Dual Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11848)

*Changjian Chen, Pengcheng Wang, Fei Lyu, Zhuo Tang, Li Yang, Long Wang, Yong Cai, Feng Yu, Kenli Li*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Hybrid Rice Breeding, Genomic Selection, Visual Analysis, Regulatory Genes, Hybrid Selection

**Relevance Score:** 0

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a visual analysis method for improving hybrid rice breeding through regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of hybrid rice breeding by integrating genomic prediction models with breeders' experience.

**Method:** A parametric dual projection method was developed for interactive dual analysis tasks, incorporating gene visualization and hybrid visualization techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a parametric dual projection method for hybrid rice breeding
	2. Creation of visualization tools for regulatory gene and hybrid identification
	3. Demonstration of method effectiveness through case studies and feedback from breeders

**Result:** The proposed method significantly aided in the identification of regulatory genes and desired hybrids, as evidenced by quantitative evaluations and positive user feedback.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the visual analysis method can streamline the hybrid rice breeding process and improve selection outcomes for breeders.

**Abstract:** Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits, such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.

### [7] [Unveiling the Visual Rhetoric of Persuasive Cartography: A Case Study of the Design of Octopus Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11903)

*Daocheng Lin, Yifan Wang, Yutong Yang, Xingyu Lan*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** data visualization, persuasion, rhetorical construction, octopus maps, ethical concerns

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes octopus maps as persuasive visual tools that utilize rhetorical construction, revealing their historical significance and contemporary relevance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in visualization research regarding the persuasive power of rhetorical construction in data visualizations.

**Method:** A focused analysis of 90 octopus maps from the 19th century to contemporary times using rhetorical schema theory to examine their persuasive intents.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of persuasive power in octopus maps
	2. Identification of rhetorical strategies in visual metaphors
	3. Discussion of contemporary relevance and ethical issues in data visualization

**Result:** The analysis shows that octopus maps remain relevant in today's digital age, highlighting the dynamic nature of their rhetorical construction and ethical issues in persuasive visualization.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Octopus maps illustrate the importance of understanding rhetorical strategies in visualizations, emphasizing the need to consider ethical concerns in their design.

**Abstract:** When designed deliberately, data visualizations can become powerful persuasive tools, influencing viewers' opinions, values, and actions. While researchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of persuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion resides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in current visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis of octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across centuries and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema theory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th century to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement their persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual metaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies are applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the above analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings. For instance, contrary to the common perception that octopus maps are primarily a historical phenomenon, our research shows that they remain a lively design convention in today's digital age. Additionally, while most octopus maps stem from Western discourse that views the octopus as an evil symbol, some designs offer alternative interpretations, highlighting the dynamic nature of rhetoric across different sociocultural settings. Lastly, drawing from the lessons provided by octopus maps, we discuss the associated ethical concerns of persuasive visualization.

### [8] [AFPM: Alignment-based Frame Patch Modeling for Cross-Dataset EEG Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11911)

*Xiaoqing Chen, Siyang Li, Dongrui Wu*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** EEG decoding, brain-computer interfaces, cross-dataset learning

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a novel calibration-free framework, AFPM, for cross-dataset EEG decoding that improves BCI performance without dataset-specific tuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Cross-dataset learning in EEG decoding for BCIs faces challenges due to inconsistencies in channel layouts and non-stationary signal distributions.

**Method:** The framework consists of two components: Spatial Alignment to standardize channels and align EEG distributions, and Frame-Patch Encoding to create unified spatiotemporal patches for decoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first calibration-free framework for EEG decoding
	2. Improved alignment of EEG signals across datasets
	3. Enhanced performance of BCI systems without dataset-specific tuning

**Result:** The AFPM framework outperforms 17 state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance improvements of 4.40% in motor imagery and 3.58% in event-related potential tasks without the need for calibration.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AFPM significantly enhances the practicality of BCIs in real-world settings by providing a calibration-free solution for EEG decoding across different datasets.

**Abstract:** Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding, which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to 4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world applications.

**Keywords:** data quality, visual analytics, machine learning, data preprocessing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents d-DQIVAR, a visual analytics system aimed at improving data quality to enhance ML model performance by combining data-driven and process-driven approaches.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacies of traditional batch data preprocessing techniques in optimizing ML model performance and to focus on genuine data quality improvement.

**Method:** The d-DQIVAR system integrates visual analytics techniques to implement both data-driven (imputation, outlier detection, etc.) and process-driven (evaluating DQ and DQI using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of d-DQIVAR as a novel visual analytics system for DQI
	2. Combines data-driven and process-driven strategies for improved ML performance
	3. Case studies and user evaluations showcasing system effectiveness

**Result:** Demonstrates effective improvement in data quality, leading to enhancements in machine learning model performance through user studies and case evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The d-DQIVAR system empowers users by allowing them to utilize their domain knowledge within a structured DQI workflow, significantly contributing to ML outcomes.

**Abstract:** Approaches to enhancing data quality (DQ) are classified into two main categories: data- and process-driven. However, prior research has predominantly utilized batch data preprocessing within the data-driven framework, which often proves insufficient for optimizing machine learning (ML) model performance and frequently leads to distortions in data characteristics. Existing studies have primarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality improvement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual analytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML model performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that leverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques tackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format standardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection. Process-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by considering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness expert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through case studies, evaluations, and user studies.

### [10] [Dataset-Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11984)

*Hyeon Jeon, Jeongin Park, Soohyun Lee, Dae Hyun Kim, Sungbok Shin, Jinwook Seo*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** dimensionality reduction, structural complexity metrics, dataset-adaptive optimization

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a dataset-adaptive approach to optimize dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, minimizing trial and error through the use of structural complexity metrics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to optimize dimensionality reduction techniques efficiently due to the extensive trial and error currently involved, which leads to excessive computational overhead.

**Method:** The approach utilizes structural complexity metrics that quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset to determine the necessity of dimensionality, thus guiding the optimization process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of structural complexity metrics for dataset-adaptive DR optimization
	2. Quantitative verification of metrics' effectiveness in approximating dataset complexity
	3. Empirical evidence showing enhanced efficiency in DR optimization processes

**Result:** The proposed metrics were verified to effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets, confirming their effectiveness in a dataset-adaptive DR workflow.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dataset-adaptive workflow significantly improves the efficiency of DR optimization while maintaining accuracy.

**Abstract:** Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR optimization without compromising accuracy.

### [11] [Envisage: Towards Expressive Visual Graph Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11999)

*Xiaolin Wen, Qishuang Fu, Shuangyue Han, Yichen Guo, Joseph K. Liu, Yong Wang*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Visual Graph Querying, graph queries, user interaction, query execution, usability

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Envisage enhances Visual Graph Querying by allowing intuitive construction and execution of complex graph queries without coding.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current VGQ tools are limited in allowing users to express complex queries interactively, requiring coding expertise.

**Method:** Envisage introduces four stages: Query Expression for intuitive graph construction, Query Verification for validation, Progressive Query Execution for meaningful results, and Result Analysis for exploration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a four-stage interactive querying process
	2. Enhanced usability for non-technical users in graph querying
	3. Support for complex query scenarios with flexible parameterization

**Result:** User studies with 14 graph analysts showed that Envisage significantly improves the usability and effectiveness of graph querying.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Envisage offers a more expressive and user-friendly approach to visual graph querying, facilitating the handling of complex queries.

**Abstract:** Graph querying is the process of retrieving information from graph data using specialized languages (e.g., Cypher), often requiring programming expertise. Visual Graph Querying (VGQ) streamlines this process by enabling users to construct and execute queries via an interactive interface without resorting to complex coding. However, current VGQ tools only allow users to construct simple and specific query graphs, limiting users' ability to interactively express their query intent, especially for underspecified query intent. To address these limitations, we propose Envisage, an interactive visual graph querying system to enhance the expressiveness of VGQ in complex query scenarios by supporting intuitive graph structure construction and flexible parameterized rule specification. Specifically, Envisage comprises four stages: Query Expression allows users to interactively construct graph queries through intuitive operations; Query Verification enables the validation of constructed queries via rule verification and query instantiation; Progressive Query Execution can progressively execute queries to ensure meaningful querying results; and Result Analysis facilitates result exploration and interpretation. To evaluate Envisage, we conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 14 graph analysts. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in constructing, verifying, and executing complex graph queries.

### [13] [Draw an Ugly Person An Exploration of Generative AIs Perceptions of Ugliness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12212)

*Garyoung Kim, Huisung Kwon, Seoju Yun, Yu-Won Youn*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Generative AI, Cultural bias, Ugliness, Ethical AI, Inclusive development

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This study analyzes how generative AI models understand and represent the concept of ugliness, revealing biases in their outputs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the reproduction of cultural biases in generative AI models, particularly regarding the concept of ugliness.

**Method:** The study extracted 13 adjectives linked to ugliness via a large language model, generating 624 images across four AI models. These images were thematically coded and analyzed for biases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of biases in generative AI representations of ugliness
	2. Identification of how AI models reinforce societal stereotypes
	3. Recommendations for ethical AI training paradigms

**Result:** AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old white male figures, revealing both entrenched social biases and paradoxical biases affecting various demographic groups.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Despite attempts at equitable representation, generative AI perpetuates inherited biases, highlighting the need for ethical AI development frameworks.

**Abstract:** Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs. These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI development.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the potential for cognitive science methods to enhance the development and evaluation of LLM systems, suggesting a latent debiasing capability in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Despite widespread debunking, many psychological myths remain deeply entrenched. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) mimic human behaviour of myth belief and explores methods to mitigate such tendencies. Using 50 popular psychological myths, we evaluate myth belief across multiple LLMs under different prompting strategies, including retrieval-augmented generation and swaying prompts. Results show that LLMs exhibit significantly lower myth belief rates than humans, though user prompting can influence responses. RAG proves effective in reducing myth belief and reveals latent debiasing potential within LLMs. Our findings contribute to the emerging field of Machine Psychology and highlight how cognitive science methods can inform the evaluation and development of LLM-based systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current methods for designing eligibility criteria in clinical trials are limited and fail to integrate detailed EHR characteristics for optimal criteria refinement.

**Method:** TrialCompass employs a knowledge-driven and outcome-driven workflow that enables clinicians to interactively explore eligibility criteria, track changes, and analyze their impact on outcomes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of TrialCompass for eligibility criteria exploration
	2. Integration of knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches
	3. History-tracking feature for iterative refinement of criteria

**Result:** TrialCompass demonstrated effectiveness with real-world datasets, providing significant insights for tailoring eligibility criteria for conditions like septic shock and acute kidney injury.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This research opens avenues for using visual analytics to improve the design and refinement of clinical trial eligibility criteria, enhancing overall trial quality and outcomes.

**Abstract:** Eligibility criteria play a critical role in clinical trials by determining the target patient population, which significantly influences the outcomes of medical interventions. However, current approaches for designing eligibility criteria have limitations to support interactive exploration of the large space of eligibility criteria. They also ignore incorporating detailed characteristics from the original electronic health record (EHR) data for criteria refinement. To address these limitations, we proposed TrialCompass, a visual analytics system integrating a novel workflow, which can empower clinicians to iteratively explore the vast space of eligibility criteria through knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches. TrialCompass supports history-tracking to help clinicians trace the evolution of their adjustments and decisions when exploring various forms of data (i.e., eligibility criteria, outcome metrics, and detailed characteristics of original EHR data) through these two approaches. This feature can help clinicians comprehend the impact of eligibility criteria on outcome metrics and patient characteristics, which facilitates systematic refinement of eligibility criteria. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TrialCompass in providing insights into designing eligibility criteria for septic shock and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We also discussed the research prospects of applying visual analytics to clinical trials.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the flexibility of text in visualizations and contribute nuanced insight into its diverse roles, enhancing existing frameworks.

**Abstract:** Text is an integral but understudied component of visualization design. Although recent studies have examined how text elements (e.g., titles and annotations) influence comprehension, preferences, and predictions, many questions remain about textual design and use in practice. This paper introduces a framework for understanding text functions in information visualizations, building on and filling gaps in prior classifications and taxonomies. Through an analysis of 120 real-world visualizations and 804 text elements, we identified ten distinct text functions, ranging from identifying data mappings to presenting valenced subtext. We further identify patterns in text usage and conduct a factor analysis, revealing four overarching text-informed design strategies: Attribution and Variables, Annotation-Centric Design, Visual Embellishments, and Narrative Framing. In addition to these factors, we explore features of title rhetoric and text multifunctionality, while also uncovering previously unexamined text functions, such as text replacing visual elements. Our findings highlight the flexibility of text, demonstrating how different text elements in a given design can combine to communicate, synthesize, and frame visual information. This framework adds important nuance and detail to existing frameworks that analyze the diverse roles of text in visualization.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing studies lack methods for extracting expertise from unstructured medical texts, which are crucial for medical education and professional development.

**Method:** Developed an interactive visual analytics system (MExplore) that integrates a fine-tuned BERT-based model to extract medical entities and a multilevel visual analysis framework for interactive exploration of medical knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MExplore system for medical expertise acquisition

**Result:** The system significantly enhances the medical expertise acquisition process based on case studies, user study, and expert interviews.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MExplore offers an effective interactive approach for acquiring and retaining knowledge from unstructured medical texts.

**Abstract:** Acquiring medical expertise is a critical component of medical education and professional development. While existing studies focus primarily on constructing medical knowledge bases or developing learning tools based on the structured, private healthcare data, they often lack methods for extracting expertise from unstructured medical texts. These texts constitute a significant portion of medical literature and offer greater flexibility and detail compared to structured data formats. Furthermore, many studies fail to provide explicit analytical and learning pathways in this context.   This paper introduces MExplore, an interactive visual analytics system designed to support the acquisition of medical expertise. To address the challenges of the inconsistencies and confidentiality concerns inherent in unstructured medical texts, we propose a workflow that employs a fine-tuned BERT-based model to extract medical entities (MEs) from them. We then present a novel multilevel visual analysis framework that integrates multiple coordinated visualizations, enabling a progressive and interactive exploration of medical knowledge.   To assess the effectiveness of MExplore, we conducted three case studies, a user study, and interviews with domain experts. The results indicate that the system significantly enhances the medical expertise acquisition process, providing an effective interactive approach for acquiring and retaining knowledge from medical texts.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the instability of meaning in language and reveal implicit beliefs in visual data journalism through a deconstructive lens.

**Method:** Qualitative analysis of interviews with 17 visual data journalists, applying deconstruction theory and genealogical analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Application of deconstruction theory to data journalism
	2. Identification of implicit beliefs impacting visualization
	3. Historic contextualization of beliefs through genealogy

**Result:** Identified opposing implicit beliefs in visual data journalism and demonstrated how they are shaped by societal forces over time.

**Limitations:** The study is based on a limited sample of journalists and may not represent all perspectives in visual data journalism.

**Conclusion:** Critical theories can reframe success in visual data storytelling and enhance research outcomes related to sociotechnical issues in data visualization.

**Abstract:** We conduct a deconstructive reading of a qualitative interview study with 17 visual data journalists from newsrooms across the globe. We borrow a deconstruction approach from literary critique to explore the instability of meaning in language and reveal implicit beliefs in words and ideas. Through our analysis we surface two sets of opposing implicit beliefs in visual data journalism: objectivity/subjectivity and humanism/mechanism. We contextualize these beliefs through a genealogical analysis, which brings deconstruction theory into practice by providing a historic backdrop for these opposing perspectives. Our analysis shows that these beliefs held within visual data journalism are not self-enclosed but rather a product of external societal forces and paradigm shifts over time. Through this work, we demonstrate how thinking with critical theories such as deconstruction and genealogy can reframe "success" in visual data storytelling and diversify visualization research outcomes. These efforts push the ways in which we as researchers produce domain knowledge to examine the sociotechnical issues of today's values towards datafication and data visualization.

### [19] [Subjective Evaluation Profile Analysis of Science Fiction Short Stories and its Critical-Theoretical Significance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11582)

*Kazuyoshi Otsuka*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, literary assessment, evaluation patterns, RLHF, aesthetic preferences

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The study examines large language models (LLMs) as literary critics by evaluating Japanese science fiction stories, revealing distinct evaluation patterns and individual characteristics influenced by RLHF.

**Read time:** 38 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Investigating how LLMs assess literature and their aesthetic preferences may provide insights into LLM behavior and biases, contributing to the understanding of AI's role in cultural contexts.

**Method:** Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were evaluated by six LLMs across seven sessions, utilizing principal component analysis and clustering techniques to analyze evaluation consistency and patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Positions LLMs as subjective literary critics
	2. Identifies distinct evaluation patterns in literary assessment
	3. Demonstrates influence of RLHF on LLM evaluation characteristics

**Result:** The analysis found five distinct evaluation patterns and significant variance in evaluation consistency among the models, as well as unique evaluation vocabularies for each LLM.

**Limitations:** Results are based on a limited set of science fiction stories, which may not generalize to other genres.

**Conclusion:** LLMs exhibit individual characteristics in literary assessment akin to human critics, challenging the notion that they are purely neutral evaluators.

**Abstract:** This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to 0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

**Method:** The study introduces MapIQ, comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps, and evaluates multiple MLLMs on six visual analytical tasks against human performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MapIQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for Map-VQA
	2. Evaluation of MLLM performance across multiple map types and tasks
	3. Insights into the impacts of map design on MLLM robustness

**Result:** MLLMs were evaluated on their performance across three map types and six tasks, with findings indicating varying robustness and sensitivity to map design changes and reliance on geographic knowledge.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Insights from these evaluations can guide future improvements in Map-VQA and enhance MLLM performance on diverse visual data.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve multimodal learning by creating a structured approach that leverages both uni-modal and paired-modal representations for better performance in various tasks.

**Method:** PgM is composed of a modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder that together allow for effective learning of both types of features and adaptable representations for different downstream tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the PgM framework for multimodal learning
	2. Effective segmentation of modal representations into uni-modal and paired-modal features
	3. Visualization insights into feature distribution across modalities and tasks.

**Result:** PgM demonstrates significant effectiveness in four multimodal tasks and shows robustness and transferability to existing models, improving our understanding of feature distribution across tasks.

**Limitations:** .

**Conclusion:** The developed framework, PgM, provides insights into the contributions of uni-modal and paired-modal features, and offers advantages such as flexible distribution adjustment and varied learning rates.

**Abstract:** Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The modular design and explainability enhancements of ExpliCIT-QA could significantly benefit applications in sensitive areas such as finance and healthcare.

**Abstract:** We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images; (2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation, where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer; and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where auditing results are critical.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** notebook understanding, Large Language Models, data flow analysis, syntactic parsing, information systems

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a strategy for better understanding Jupyter notebooks using a combination of syntactic analysis and Large Language Models (LLMs) to resolve ambiguities in data flow and dependencies between cells.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the flow of information in data science and machine learning notebooks is crucial for their effective reuse and adaptation, yet existing LLMs struggle with ambiguities due to hallucinations and long-context issues.

**Method:** The proposed method, CRABS, uses shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to interpret notebooks, then employs an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities in the data inputs and outputs of notebook cells, moving through a cell-by-cell zero-shot learning approach.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) for notebook comprehension
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness using a large dataset of annotated notebooks
	3. High accuracy in resolving ambiguities and identifying information flows and dependencies.

**Result:** CRABS achieved an F1 score of 98% in identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% in identifying transitive cell execution dependencies when evaluated on a dataset of 50 annotated Kaggle notebooks and was able to resolve 98% of ambiguities present in the notebooks.

**Limitations:** The performance may vary with different notebook formats or unobserved edge cases not present in the training data.

**Conclusion:** The combination of syntactic analysis and LLMs significantly enhances the understanding of information flows and dependencies in Jupyter notebooks, making a valuable contribution to the effective reuse of data science resources.

**Abstract:** Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the accuracy of classifying sentences as subjective or objective in news articles, particularly in multilingual settings where generalization to unseen languages is critical.

**Method:** The proposed method integrates sentiment scores from an auxiliary model with transformer-based classifiers like mDeBERTaV3-base and Llama3.2-1B, using decision threshold calibration to address class imbalance across several languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	2. Demonstration of enhancements across multiple languages, including unseen ones
	3. Optimizing decision thresholds to alleviate class imbalance

**Result:** Results showed that integrating sentiment features significantly improved the performance of subjectivity detection, yielding a notable Macro F1 score of 0.51 for Greek language data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The sentiment-augmented classifier framework demonstrates a robust approach to enhancing subjectivity detection performance and achieving high rankings in multilingual settings.

**Abstract:** This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings. Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English, Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages (e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base (English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine the competition between factual and counterfactual information in LLMs and understand the role of attention heads in this process.

**Method:** The study reproduces findings from recent literature using Mechanistic Interpretability tools to analyze attention head behaviors and their impact on factual output ratios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Reconciliation of findings from multiple studies on LLMs' handling of factual and counterfactual information.
	2. Insights into the role of attention heads in factual output management.
	3. Demonstration of domain specificity in attention head behaviors.

**Result:** The findings indicate that attention heads facilitating factual output operate through general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, and the behavior of attention heads is affected by the domain of the information.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Attention head behavior is domain-specific, revealing that larger models may demonstrate more specialized patterns that are sensitive to different categories.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.

**Result:** The baseline models achieved performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art models in the language identification task.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work contributes a valuable resource and models for advancing research in language identification, particularly for the diverse Indian languages.

**Abstract:** The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging. In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Autoregressive models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel framework that allows autoregressive language models to predict multiple future tokens simultaneously, significantly improving generation speed without compromising quality.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the slow inference speed and limited parallelism of autoregressive language models, especially during later stages of generation.

**Method:** The approach includes a masked-input formulation for joint prediction, a gated LoRA to preserve original functionality, a lightweight sampler for coherent sequence generation, auxiliary training losses for coherence and accuracy, and a speculative generation strategy for quadratic token expansion.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Masked-input formulation for jointly predicting future tokens
	2. Gated LoRA formulation for multi-token prediction
	3. Lightweight learnable sampler for generating coherent sequences

**Result:** The proposed method enables code and math generation nearly 5x faster, and improves general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x without loss of quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework enhances the performance of autoregressive language models by leveraging knowledge of future tokens for faster and coherent text generation.

**Abstract:** Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any loss in quality.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance automated text anonymization by improving the recognition of PII across different domains.

**Method:** The study employs annotated datasets from healthcare, legal, and biographical sources to evaluate model performance in in-domain and cross-domain settings, along with few-shot learning techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of cross-domain model transfer for PII recognition
	2. Insights into data fusion benefits across domains
	3. Demonstration of effective few-shot learning in PII recognition

**Result:** The findings indicate that legal-domain data transfers effectively to biographical contexts, while medical domain data shows resistance to transfer. Additionally, the advantages of data fusion vary by domain, and high-quality recognition is attainable with significantly reduced training data in low-specialization domains.

**Limitations:** The transfer effectiveness is domain-specific, with medical data being less adaptable to other domains.

**Conclusion:** Cross-domain model transfer and data fusion can improve PII recognition, particularly in legal and biographical contexts, even with limited training data.

**Abstract:** Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2), legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

**Conclusion:** Offers a flexible framework that balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data (MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel, high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

### [32] [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878)

*Jiachen Zhao, Jing Huang, Zhengxuan Wu, David Bau, Weiyan Shi*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Harmfulness, Refusal, LLMs, AI safety, Latent Guard

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores a new dimension of harmfulness in LLMs, offering insights on their internal understanding of harmfulness versus refusal, and proposes a safety application termed Latent Guard.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate whether LLMs truly understand harmfulness beyond merely refusing harmful instructions, and to identify a robust mechanism for AI safety.

**Method:** The researchers analyze the harmfulness and refusal directions in LLMs, employing causal evidence to demonstrate that these two concepts operate independently within the models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of a harmfulness direction distinct from refusal direction in LLMs
	2. Development of Latent Guard as a safeguard for detecting unsafe inputs
	3. Empirical evidence showing LLMs have a more robust understanding of harmfulness than refusal

**Result:** The study finds that steering LLMs toward the harmfulness direction can incorrectly label harmless instructions as harmful, while steering toward refusal triggers direct refusal responses. Latent Guard was shown to perform effectively against various jailbreaking methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLMs possess a distinct internal representation of harmfulness that can be harnessed for safety applications, providing a more reliable assessment of harmful inputs compared to their refusal behavior.

**Abstract:** LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the evaluation of Large Language Models in multilingual contexts where existing datasets are limited and often not adequately localized.

**Method:** A hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification was used to create the Marco-Bench-MIF, which was then evaluated on over 20 LLMs, assessing their performance across high and low-resource languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Marco-Bench-MIF, a multilingual benchmark
	2. Identification of performance gaps between high and low-resource languages
	3. Insight into the impact of localization on LLM accuracy

**Result:** Findings show a 25-35% accuracy gap between high and low-resource languages, model scales affect performance by 45-60%, and localized data highlights a 7-22% underestimation of machine-translated data accuracy.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may still not fully capture all linguistic and cultural nuances across all 30 languages.

**Conclusion:** The study identifies significant challenges in multilingual instruction following, including keyword consistency and compositional constraints, while providing a new benchmark for future research.

**Abstract:** Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval, are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1) 25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges, and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Bench-MIF.

**Conclusion:** The proposed BlockBPE method significantly enhances performance for tokenization in large language model pipelines, enabling more efficient use of GPU resources.

**Abstract:** Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput, batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads, BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over HuggingFace Tokenizers.

**Motivation:** Existing prompt compression methods lack consideration for attention-critical tokens and changes in information entropy during compression.

**Method:** DAC integrates both entropy and attention information, dynamically adjusting for entropy shifts during the compression process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a dynamic attention-aware approach for prompt compression.
	2. Integrates entropy and attention information for better compression.

**Result:** DAC demonstrates substantial improvements across various domains such as LongBench, GSM8K, and BBH, outperforming prior methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed DAC method effectively enhances prompt compression in task-agnostic settings, showing robust performance across diverse tasks and LLMs.

**Abstract:** Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench, GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling evidence of its efficacy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The IAM framework is a versatile tool to improve LLM efficiency, complementing existing cache optimization methods.

**Abstract:** LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays, especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

	2. A two-step post-training method that enhances accuracy and speed.
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements at extremely low precisions.

**Result:** The proposed PoT method improves on state-of-the-art accuracy and achieves significant speedups in dequantization, specifically $3.67\times$ on NVIDIA V100 and $1.63\times$ on NVIDIA RTX 4090.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The PoT quantization framework provides an effective solution for low-precision integer quantization of LLMs, enabling faster and more accurate model deployment.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

**Result:** A demonstrably effective pipeline that enhances translation quality while addressing safety concerns in multicultural large language models.

**Limitations:** The approach is specific to low-resource language pairs and may require further adaptation for broader language use cases.

**Conclusion:** The framework not only improves translation for low-resource contexts but also supports culturally sensitive moderation and highlights the importance of sociolinguistic nuances.

**Abstract:** As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech. Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP, we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the influence of gender bias in speech perception tasks, particularly regarding Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

**Method:** Conducted a perception experiment with 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese and Greek speech samples for signs of AD.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease speech.
	2. Demonstration that shimmer values correlate with AD perception, particularly in male speech.
	3. Call for inclusion of gender factors in AD detection model development.

**Result:** Male speech was more frequently identified as AD, with significant associations found between shimmer values in male speech and AD perception.

**Limitations:** Limited to 16 Chinese listeners and does not account for broader linguistic variations.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of addressing gender bias in AD detection models and suggest further research is needed across different languages.

**Abstract:** Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for further research to validate model performance across different linguistic contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the differences in language comprehension between humans and LLMs, particularly in functional tasks such as inference and information retrieval.

**Method:** An LLM-based AI agent formed a graph-based text representation of a reading passage by grouping words into nodes and edges, followed by comparing eye fixation distributions on these important semantic structures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a graph-based approach to language comprehension analysis
	2. Comparison of human and LLMs' understanding through eye-tracking data
	3. Insights into human-AI co-learning strategies based on semantic representations

**Result:** LLMs showed high consistency in understanding language based on the graph topological structure, indicating a richer comprehension model than previous studies focused on individual words.

**Limitations:** Focus on graph structures may limit understanding of other linguistic features; needs broader validation across more diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest effective strategies for human-AI co-learning by leveraging LLMs' understanding of semantic networks.

**Abstract:** Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development. With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns, particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved clarity in interactive systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the role of value similarity in building trust and relationships in artificial societies formed by LLM agents, paralleling human social dynamics.

**Method:** Conducted two experiments: a preliminary one to evaluate controllability of values in LLMs, and a main experiment analyzing mutual evaluations of trust and closeness between LLM agent pairs with specific values.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of value similarity in LLM agents
	2. Demonstrated controllability of LLM agent values
	3. Provided empirical evidence linking values to trust and relationship-building in artificial entities

**Result:** Higher value similarity among LLM agents led to significantly increased trust and interpersonal closeness after dialogue.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLM agent simulations effectively test social science theories and illuminate how values affect relationship building, offering potential for new theoretical insights.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, nLP, simplification, homonyms, educational NLP

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the impact of simplification on the quality of homonym definitions generated by LLMs for different target groups, revealing that simplification can degrade definition completeness but can be improved with fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how the simplification of definitions affects different target groups and the quality of information provided by LLMs, particularly for words with multiple meanings.

**Method:** The study tests various LLMs (DeepSeek v3, Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B) using two novel evaluation datasets across different languages, assessing performance through LLM-as-Judge and human annotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the impact of simplification on homonym definitions for different target groups.
	2. Developed novel evaluation datasets for multi-language assessment.
	3. Demonstrated the effectiveness of fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B to improve homonym definition quality.

**Result:** Results indicate that simplification significantly reduces definition completeness, exposing users to a higher risk of misunderstanding, particularly for homonyms. In contrast, fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization improved its response quality for all prompt types.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Balancing simplicity and completeness in educational NLP applications is crucial to provide reliable definitions that cater to all learners' needs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3, Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

**Abstract:** This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models, emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Humans leaned towards extending creativity, while LLMs preferred fixed creativity, indicating a divergence in creative strategies between the two.

**Abstract:** The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

**Motivation:** To evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in determining cardinal directions, given their importance in spatial understanding.

**Method:** An extensive testing setup using templates that vary means of locomotion and perspective (first, second, or third person) to assess LLM performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a benchmark for testing LLMs on cardinal direction reasoning.
	2. Insights into the variations of performance based on different locomotion means and perspectives.
	3. Extension of previous research findings on LLM reasoning abilities.

**Result:** Most LLMs, including newer Large Reasoning Models, struggled to reliably determine the correct cardinal direction across various scenarios.

**Limitations:** Focuses solely on cardinal directions; results may not generalize to other reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate limitations in LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities, suggesting a need for improvement in their handling of cardinal direction tasks.

**Abstract:** We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current coreference resolution benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating systems on long documents, which poses challenges in performance measurement for extensive texts such as books.

**Method:** A new automatic pipeline is developed to generate high-quality coreference resolution annotations for full narrative texts, leading to the creation of the BOOKCOREF benchmark.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an automatic annotation pipeline for long texts
	2. Creation of the BOOKCOREF benchmark for coreference resolution
	3. Identification of performance challenges in processing large documents

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that coreference resolution systems can improve performance by up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated using the BOOKCOREF benchmark, although challenges arise that reduce effectiveness compared to smaller document benchmarks.

**Limitations:** Current models do not achieve the same performance on book-scale texts as they do on smaller documents.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for novel coreference resolution methods capable of handling book-scale texts and identifies performance gaps in existing models.

**Abstract:** Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap, we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

**Motivation:** To address students' struggles with math and improve learning outcomes by enhancing traditional teaching methods through innovative pedagogical strategies involving LLMs.

**Method:** An intervention study comparing the MEGA approach with traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) methods using a within-group design on two different math datasets with university students.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MEGA educational approach combining multiple pedagogical methods
	2. Empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of MEGA over traditional teaching methods in math education
	3. Utilization of large language models to enhance student learning experiences.

**Result:** Students reported a significantly better learning experience with the MEGA approach compared to the CoT method, especially in the more challenging MATH dataset, achieving 47.5% versus 26.67%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The MEGA method demonstrates a superior ability to help students understand and learn difficult math problems compared to traditional pedagogical methods.

**Abstract:** This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3) simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students' Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT) method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students. Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

**Motivation:** To address data sparsity in NLP and improve the effectiveness of data augmentation methods, particularly in low-resource settings.

**Method:** The framework includes Scalability Analysis for measuring semantic consistency and Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR) for tracking semantic drift across paraphrasing cycles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a principled evaluation framework for LLM-based text augmentation.
	2. Development of Scalability Analysis and IASR for semantic consistency measurement.
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing topic granularity and reducing overlaps in a real-world application.

**Result:** Empirical evaluations demonstrated that GPT-3.5 Turbo provided the best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and efficiency, resulting in significant improvements in topic modeling tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The evaluation framework is validated as useful for structured assessment of LLM-based augmentation in NLP, showing enhanced topic generation capabilities.

**Abstract:** Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability. This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model (LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases, and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency. Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

**Conclusion:** While the generative models show acceptable performance, improvements are needed in both question creation and evaluation methodologies to enhance accuracy and reliability in assessing answers.

**Abstract:** ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is one such shared task.   In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1) Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers, all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.   We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German, Ukrainian, and Czech languages.   This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2 Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual evaluation.   We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers, our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up questions as acceptable.

**Motivation:** To explore the relationship between observable translation behavior and higher-order cognitive processes during the act of translation.

**Method:** Analysis of keystrokes and gaze data to identify hidden mental processing structures, organized in a hierarchical multi-layered BTSS.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the BTSS framework
	2. Hierarchical organization of translation behavior
	3. Integration of cognitive processes with observable translation actions

**Result:** Development of BTSS as a foundation for a computational translation agent that simulates the dynamics of affect, behavior, and cognition in human translation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The BTSS framework can enhance understanding and simulation of cognitive processes in translation, revealing insights into the interplay between behavior and translation states.

**Abstract:** The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation production.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an ASR-free method for assessing isolated word reading in low-resource settings using few-shot learning and self-supervised models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective reading assessment methods in low-resource environments, particularly for children.

**Method:** The approach involves comparing child speech inputs to adult reference templates using intermediate layers from SSL models, including discretisation of features and barycentre averaging.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an ASR-free method for word reading assessment
	2. Investigation of SSL model features for child speech
	3. Experimental evidence of performance discrepancies between adult and child speech

**Result:** Idealised experiments reveal reasonable performance for adult speech but significant performance drops for child speech, indicating challenges in processing child data with SSL representations.

**Limitations:** Performance drops significantly for child speech input even when using child templates within the few-shot system.

**Conclusion:** While SSL methods show promise for speech tasks, they struggle with child speech in few-shot classification scenarios, underscoring limitations in current techniques.

**Abstract:** We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL) models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data when used in a few-shot classification system.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Automatic Speech Recognition, Keyword Recognition, Large Language Models, Multi-grained Fusion, Late-fusion Strategy

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a multi-grained fusion approach for ASR that combines token-level and phrase-level keyword recognition using LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in keyword accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the accuracy of keyword recognition in ASR systems, particularly for proper nouns and user-specific entities, by integrating different fusion strategies.

**Method:** The proposed method uses a late-fusion strategy that integrates acoustic information from ASR with contextual knowledge from LLMs, utilizing both token-level and phrase-level fusion.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A novel multi-grained fusion approach that integrates token-level and phrase-level recognition.
	2. Implementation of a late-fusion strategy combining ASR data with LLM context.
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art results on keyword-related metrics.

**Result:** Experiments on Chinese and English datasets show that the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while maintaining high accuracy on non-keyword text.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that the combination of token-level and phrase-level components significantly enhances performance and that both are critical in the multi-grained framework.

**Abstract:** While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or user-specific entities.   Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that enables direct copying of keyword phrases.   However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own limitations.   In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs).   Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.   Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.   Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level components both contribute significantly to the performance gains, complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.   The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** Introducing the translationese-index (T-index) for quantitatively measuring translationese using fine-tuned language models.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To establish a quantitative measure for translationese that captures its nuances and can predict human judgments.

**Method:** Utilization of two contrastively fine-tuned language models to compute a translationese-index (T-index) from likelihood ratios, evaluated on synthetic and real translation datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First quantitative measure for translationese (T-index)
	2. Robustness demonstrated through human judgment correlation
	3. Complementary to existing MT quality metrics

**Result:** The T-index robustly predicts human annotations of translationese, correlating well with human ratings and showing low correlation with existing MT quality metrics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** T-index effectively indicates translationese levels and complements existing translation quality estimation methods like BLEU and COMET.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese -- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$). Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation (MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary metric in MT QE.

**Motivation:** To improve integration and interoperability of clinical data using the HL7 FHIR standard, overcoming limitations of previous rule-based systems and LLMs.

**Method:** Development of an end-to-end framework that leverages LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology databases to convert free-form clinical notes into structured data adhering to the FHIR schema.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an LLM-powered framework for clinical data integration
	2. Integration with healthcare terminology databases
	3. Competitive performance against human benchmarks for FHIR resource prediction

**Result:** Infherno competes well against a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text, facilitating clinical data integration across institutions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The implementation of Infherno provides significant advances in the automated structuring of clinical notes, promoting interoperability in healthcare settings.

**Abstract:** For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Text Anomaly Detection, Large Language Models, Embedding Evaluation

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for text anomaly detection, utilizing embeddings from various pre-trained language models to evaluate their effectiveness across multiple datasets.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating text anomaly detection methods hinders progress in the field.

**Method:** The study conducts empirical evaluations using embeddings from early and multiple large language models (LLMs) on diverse text datasets, employing comprehensive metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a comprehensive benchmark for text anomaly detection.
	2. Evaluated a variety of embedding models across multiple domains.
	3. Discovered that the quality of embeddings significantly impacts detection efficacy.

**Result:** The research finds that embedding quality is crucial for anomaly detection and that deep learning approaches do not outperform classical methods when using LLM embeddings.

**Limitations:** Limited to the evaluated embedding models and datasets; further studies needed with additional models and domains.

**Conclusion:** The open-sourcing of the benchmark toolkit facilitates future research in text anomaly detection systems.

**Abstract:** Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, VHDL, Code Generation, Summarization, Chain-of-Descriptions

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** The study evaluates the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization, highlighting their underperformance in this domain and proposing an improved approach called Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of research on evaluating LLMs for hardware description languages like VHDL, despite their use in various code-related tasks.

**Method:** The study assesses LLM performance using two datasets (VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform) and introduces CoDes, which generates intermediate descriptive steps to improve code generation and summarization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLMs for VHDL tasks using two datasets
	2. Introduction of Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes) to enhance performance
	3. Empirical results showing significant improvements in generated code quality

**Result:** LLMs consistently underperformed in VHDL tasks across metrics, while the CoDes approach demonstrated significant improvements over standard prompting strategies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CoDes not only enhances VHDL code generation and summarization but also provides a framework for future research on improving code LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.

**TL;DR:** The study investigates gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease speech, showing that male speech is more frequently identified as AD, especially in Chinese speech, and emphasizes the need to address this bias in AD detection models.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the influence of gender bias on the perception of Alzheimer's Disease speech and heretofore unexamined effects in different linguistic contexts.

**Method:** Conducted a perception experiment with 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese and Greek speech, with acoustic analysis of male and female speech.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated gender bias in AD speech perception
	2. Presented acoustic analysis linking shimmer values to AD identification
	3. Highlighted the impact of gender bias on detection model performance

**Result:** Identified a significant gender bias where male speech was more frequently perceived as AD; acoustic analysis correlates shimmer values in male speech with AD identification.

**Limitations:** The study involved a limited sample size of listeners and languages, which may affect generalizability.

**Conclusion:** Addressing gender bias is crucial in the development of Alzheimer's Disease detection models and requires further research for validation in various linguistic contexts.

**Abstract:** Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for further research to validate model performance across different linguistic contexts.

**Motivation:** Existing LLMs struggle with ambiguity in user requests, justifying the need for improved interaction frameworks.

**Method:** The study implements a multi-agent debate framework involving three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, Mistral-7B) evaluated on a dataset rich in ambiguities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-agent debate framework for LLMs
	2. Demonstration of effective ambiguity resolution using collective model strategies
	3. Empirical evidence of enhanced performance through structured debates

**Result:** Debate framework significantly improved performance; Mistral-7B-led debates achieved a 76.7% success rate in handling complex ambiguities.

**Limitations:** Varied responses of models to collaborative strategies may affect consistency.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the value of structured debates for enhancing LLM capabilities in clarity and user interactions.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved clarity in interactive systems.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Explore the capacity of LLMs with web browsing capabilities to analyze social media data and infer user demographics, addressing a gap in the current research.

**Method:** Utilized a synthetic dataset of 48 Twitter accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants to evaluate LLM performance in predicting demographics from social media profiles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated LLMs' capability to access and analyze social media data for demographic inference.
	2. Identified biases based on user activity in demographic predictions.
	3. Provided guidelines for LLM application in research with societal implications.

**Result:** LLMs demonstrated the ability to accurately predict user demographics from social media content, although biases were observed in accounts with limited activity.

**Limitations:** The study's reliance on synthetic accounts and potential biases in data analysis limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs can contribute to computational social science, their ability to infer demographics raises ethical concerns, necessitating protective measures in their deployment.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements, however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites, their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants, we show that these models can access social media content and predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles, which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research purposes.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how to identify and correct arithmetic errors in language models can enhance their reliability and performance in tasks involving numerical reasoning.

**Method:** The authors utilize probes to decode the model's hidden states for predicting correctness on 3-digit addition and related problems, developing lightweight error detectors that operate with high accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated effective detection of arithmetic errors in language models using internal activations.
	2. Developed error detectors that achieve over 90% accuracy on a controlled addition task.
	3. Showed generalization of simple arithmetic probes to complex problem-solving scenarios.

**Result:** Lightweight error detectors achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting model correctness and generalize well to more complex problems, providing insights into the internal representations of language models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that arithmetic errors can be detected through internal model activations, and probes can effectively guide corrections without heavily disrupting correct outputs.

**Abstract:** We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of Large Language Models in handling proprietary enterprise data, including structured and semi-structured formats.

**Method:** The proposed RAG framework employs a combination of dense embeddings and BM25 for retrieval, along with metadata-aware filtering, semantic chunking for coherence, and quantized indexing for efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Hybrid retrieval combining dense embeddings and BM25
	2. Metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER
	3. Quantized indexing for enhanced retrieval efficiency

**Result:** Experiments indicate a 15% increase in Precision@5, a 13% increase in Recall@5, and a 16% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank, alongside qualitative enhancements in Faithfulness, Completeness, and Relevance scores.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework effectively delivers accurate and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks and has potential for future enhancements including multimodal data processing.

**Abstract:** Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.   This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.   Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot

	2. Achieved accurate predictions with a lightweight probe even before reasoning completion.
	3. Showed that findings are generalizable across different model sizes and safety benchmarks.

**Result:** A linear probe on CoT activations significantly outperformed text-based methods, providing accurate predictions of response safety even before reasoning completion.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Utilizing model latents for monitoring can enable real-time safety interventions during text generation, demonstrating broader applicability across model types and safety metrics.

**Abstract:** Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

**TL;DR:** The Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM) improves upon variational autoencoder-based neural topic models by addressing posterior collapse through the use of the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To resolve the issues of posterior collapse in variational autoencoder-based neural topic models and enhance topic modeling effectiveness in high-dimensional text data.

**Method:** S2WTM employs a latent space with a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and uses the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Spherical Sliced Wasserstein distance in topic modeling
	2. Enhanced coherence and diversity of generated topics
	3. Improved performance on downstream tasks compared to existing models

**Result:** S2WTM demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art topic models, yielding more coherent and diverse topics and improving performance on subsequent tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** S2WTM effectively captures hyperspherical structure in the latent space while overcoming challenges associated with posterior collapse, making it a valuable approach for topic modeling.

**Abstract:** Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving performance on downstream tasks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Data Selection, Benchmarking, Model Training

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a method called benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR) for selecting pretraining documents based on their similarity to benchmark training examples, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance and efficiency.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the impact of making data selection optimization explicit in the context of training machine learning models, contrasting it with benchmark-driven iteration.

**Method:** Benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR) embeds benchmark examples with a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scoring the documents by their similarity to benchmarks and training a classifier to predict these scores for the entire corpus.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR) for data selection.
	2. Demonstration of a substantial performance improvement across various models and tasks using BETR.
	3. Analysis of the relationship between model size and data filtering requirements.

**Result:** BETR allows for a 2.1x compute multiplier over the DCLM-Baseline and 4.7x over unfiltered data, improving performance on 9 out of 10 tasks across scales.

**Limitations:** The methodology may not generalize perfectly across all domains, and further exploration is needed on the implications of varying benchmark diversity.

**Conclusion:** Directly aligning pretraining data with evaluation benchmarks enhances model capabilities and indicates that selection strategies should adjust with model scale.

**Abstract:** Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline (4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

**TL;DR:** RAGGED is a framework for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation systems across various configurations, revealing key insights into reader robustness and system performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges and performance variability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and provide a structured approach for evaluation.

**Method:** RAGGED systematically evaluates RAG systems by testing different retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets, focusing on reader robustness to noisy information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RAGGED framework for evaluating RAG systems
	2. Identification of reader robustness as a key factor for performance stability
	3. Development of new metrics for assessing RAG stability and scalability

**Result:** Analysis of RAG systems indicates that reader robustness is crucial for stability, while the performance impact of retrievers and prompts varies depending on the reader's sensitivity to distraction.

**Limitations:** The framework may not fully account for all potential configurations or external factors affecting RAG performance.

**Conclusion:** RAGGED offers new metrics for assessing RAG system stability and scalability, encouraging optimization of retrieval depths and overall model robustness in future research.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances language models by integrating external knowledge, but its effectiveness is highly dependent on system configuration. Improper retrieval settings can degrade performance, making RAG less reliable than closed-book generation. In this work, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for systematically evaluating RAG systems across diverse retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets. Our analysis reveals that reader robustness to noise is the key determinant of RAG stability and scalability. Some readers benefit from increased retrieval depth, while others degrade due to their sensitivity to distracting content. Through large-scale experiments on open-domain, multi-hop, and specialized-domain datasets, we show that retrievers, rerankers, and prompts influence performance but do not fundamentally alter these reader-driven trends. By providing a principled framework and new metrics to assess RAG stability and scalability, RAGGED enables systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation systems, guiding future research on optimizing retrieval depth and model robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Concerns about copyright infringement and membership inference in large language models, with a focus on simplifying the process for end users.

**Method:** An insert-and-detect methodology utilizing unique identifiers in copyrighted text and introducing methods like ghost sentences and a last-k words test for user engagement.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ghost sentences for membership inference
	2. Development of a last-k words test for user engagement
	3. Comprehensive study on factors affecting memorization and inference in LLMs

**Result:** The study demonstrates the effectiveness of ghost sentences for membership inference, incorporating factors like training data scales and model sizes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods provide a feasible approach for users to check copyright membership and show applicability in real scenarios.

**Abstract:** A primary concern regarding training large language models (LLMs) is whether they abuse copyrighted online text. With the increasing training data scale and the prevalence of LLMs in daily lives, two problems arise: \textbf{1)} false positive membership inference results misled by similar examples; \textbf{2)} membership inference methods are usually too complex for end users to understand and use. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detect} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{\textbf{ghost sentences}} and a user-friendly last-$k$ words test, allowing end users to chat with LLMs for membership inference. Ghost sentences consist primarily of unique passphrases of random natural words, which can come with customized elements to bypass possible filter rules. The last-$k$ words test requires a significant repetition time of ghost sentences~($\ge10$). For cases with fewer repetitions, we designed an extra perplexity test, as LLMs exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. We also conduct a comprehensive study on the memorization and membership inference of ghost sentences, examining factors such as training data scales, model sizes, repetition times, insertion positions, wordlist of passphrases, alignment, \textit{etc}. Our study shows the possibility of applying ghost sentences in real scenarios and provides instructions for the potential application.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM), which improves upon current interpretable models while aligning accuracy with interpretability and reducing the need for extensive annotations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for better interpretability in Large-Language Models (LLMs) and the limitations of existing post-hoc interpretation methods.

**Method:** The authors propose LICEM, which offers improved classification accuracy compared to existing interpretable models and maintains consistency and interveneability in its explanations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LICEM as a novel model for interpretable predictions
	2. Improved classification accuracy that matches black-box models
	3. Automatic prediction of concepts without extensive annotations

**Result:** LICEM achieves better classification accuracy than both existing interpretable models and black-box models, while providing explanations that are more interveneable and causally consistent.

**Limitations:** LICEM remains bound by certain architectural constraints and may still require further validation in diverse real-world applications.

**Conclusion:** LICEM can be trained without concept supervision, predicting concepts automatically using an LLM backbone, thus overcoming the annotation challenges in real-world text data.

**Abstract:** Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism due to their lack of interpretability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they only approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to be unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been lately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based on human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several limitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity, to the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task predictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for real-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the current accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show that the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and causally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that LICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts can be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.

**Keywords:** large language models, knowledge editing, perplexingness, hierarchical relationships, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the challenges of updating knowledge in large language models (LLMs) using the concept of 'perplexingness', which reflects how conflicting new information is with established conceptual hierarchies.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** As large language models (LLMs) struggle with post-training knowledge updates, understanding the factors that affect the editing process is critical for improving their adaptability and accuracy.

**Method:** The authors introduce a concept called perplexingness and create the HierarchyData dataset, which consists of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs. They conduct controlled experiments to analyze the relationship between perplexingness and the effectiveness of knowledge editing across different models and methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the concept of perplexingness as it relates to knowledge editing in LLMs.
	2. Development of HierarchyData, a novel dataset for studying hyponym-hypernym relationships.
	3. Empirical analysis showing the negative correlation between perplexingness and editing effectiveness.

**Result:** The study finds a strong negative correlation between perplexingness and knowledge editing effectiveness, indicating that edits that conflict more with known hierarchies are harder to implement.

**Limitations:** The study is based on a limited dataset and further research is needed to generalize findings across additional categories and models.

**Conclusion:** Knowledge editing in LLMs is fundamentally challenging as conflicting new information becomes increasingly resistant to effective modification, particularly when it involves higher-level abstract concepts.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but updating their knowledge post-training remains a critical challenge. While recent model editing techniques like Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) show promise, their effectiveness may vary based on the nature of the knowledge being edited. We introduce the concept of ``perplexingness'': the degree to which new knowledge conflicts with an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies and categorical relationships. For instance, editing ``British Shorthair is a kind of cat'' to ``British Shorthair is a kind of dog'' represents a low-perplexingness edit within the same taxonomic level, while editing ``A cat is a kind of animal'' to ``A cat is a kind of plant'' represents a high-perplexingness edit that violates fundamental categorical boundaries. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we introduce HierarchyData, a carefully curated dataset of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Through controlled experiments across three models and four editing methods, we demonstrate a strong negative correlation between the perplexingness of new knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge editing. Our analysis reveals that edits involving more abstract concepts (hypernyms) generally exhibit higher perplexingness and are more resistant to modification than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). These findings highlight a fundamental challenge in LLM knowledge editing: the more a new fact contradicts an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies, the harder it becomes to reliably encode that knowledge.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how the spiritual values reflected in the training data of LLMs affect their behavior and sensitivity in social-fairness scenarios, particularly in hate speech identification.

**Method:** Experimental testing of LLMs' spiritual values and their impact on sensitivity to different hate target groups, followed by a proposal for continuing pre-training with spiritual texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Verification of diverse spiritual values in LLMs
	2. Analysis of LLM sensitivity in social-fairness scenarios
	3. Proposing continued pre-training on spiritual texts to reduce biases

**Result:** Results show that LLMs embody diverse spiritual values and their sensitivity to hate speech varies according to these values. Continuing pre-training on spiritual texts improves LLM performance in mitigating spiritual biases.

**Limitations:** The study may not cover all potential biases present in LLMs and focuses specifically on spiritual values.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the significance of spiritual values in shaping LLM behavior and suggests a methodology to address associated biases through targeted pre-training.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tool for users from various backgrounds. LLMs, trained on vast corpora, reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances embedded in their pre-training data. However, the values and perspectives inherent in this data can influence the behavior of LLMs, leading to potential biases. As a result, the use of LLMs in contexts involving spiritual or moral values necessitates careful consideration of these underlying biases. Our work starts with verification of our hypothesis by testing the spiritual values of popular LLMs. Experimental results show that LLMs' spiritual values are quite diverse, as opposed to the stereotype of atheists or secularists. We then investigate how different spiritual values affect LLMs in social-fairness scenarios e.g., hate speech identification). Our findings reveal that different spiritual values indeed lead to different sensitivity to different hate target groups. Furthermore, we propose to continue pre-training LLMs on spiritual texts, and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating spiritual bias.

**Motivation:** To test whether LLMs can effectively use context and collocational frequency to resolve idiomaticity in language.

**Method:** A controlled contrastive dataset was constructed for evaluating LLM performance on idiomaticity detection tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel controlled dataset for testing idiomaticity in LLMs.
	2. Analysis of the impact of contextual understanding and collocational frequency on model performance.
	3. Public release of the code and dataset for further research.

**Result:** LLMs often struggle to resolve idiomaticity when contextual understanding is necessary; performance improves with higher sentence likelihood and collocational frequency.

**Limitations:** The study may not fully account for all variables influencing idiomaticity resolution beyond context and frequency.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate significant limitations in LLMs' contextual processing abilities concerning idioms, highlighting the need for better dataset designs.

**Abstract:** Human processing of idioms relies on understanding the contextual sentences in which idioms occur, as well as language-intrinsic features such as frequency and speaker-intrinsic factors like familiarity. While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood. The collocational frequency of expressions also impacts performance. We make our code and dataset publicly available.

**Conclusion:** This method shows potential for balancing efficiency and accuracy in language processing applications.

**Abstract:** The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a significant challenge due to their computational demands, specially on tasks requiring long outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Replacing or supplementing crowdsourced labels with LLM-generated labels resulted in significant accuracy improvements, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on the NewsEmp benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that LLMs can effectively enhance model training in empathy computing and highlight the need for careful evaluation metric selection due to demographic biases.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised many fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) offering accessible, general-purpose solutions without costly task-specific training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for directly solving tasks (in vivo), this paper explores LLMs' potential for in-vitro applications: using LLM-generated labels to improve supervised training of mainstream models. We examine two strategies - (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation - in empathy computing, an emerging task to predict psychology-based questionnaire outcomes from inputs like textual narratives. Crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. We show that replacing or supplementing these crowdsourced labels with LLM-generated labels, developed using psychology-based scale-aware prompts, achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements. Notably, the RoBERTa pre-trained language model (PLM) trained with noise-reduced labels yields a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on the public NewsEmp benchmarks. This paper further analyses evaluation metric selection and demographic biases to help guide the future development of more equitable empathy computing models.

**Abstract:** Formalized mathematics has recently garnered significant attention for its ability to assist mathematicians across various fields. Premise retrieval, as a common step in mathematical formalization, has been a challenge, particularly for inexperienced users. Existing retrieval methods that facilitate natural language queries require a certain level of mathematical expertise from users, while approaches based on formal languages (e.g., Lean) typically struggle with the scarcity of training data, hindering the training of effective and generalizable retrieval models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages data extracted from Mathlib to train a lightweight and effective premise retrieval model. In particular, the proposed model embeds queries (i.e., proof state provided by Lean) and premises in a latent space, featuring a tokenizer specifically trained on formal corpora. The model is learned in a contrastive learning framework, in which a fine-grained similarity calculation method and a re-ranking module are applied to enhance the retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining a lower computational load.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens used   by a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.

**Conclusion:** DEEPER demonstrates a robust method for ongoing persona optimization, surpassing traditional methods in accuracy and effectiveness.

**Abstract:** To advance personalized applications such as recommendation systems and user behavior prediction, recent research increasingly adopts large language models (LLMs) for human -readable persona modeling. In dynamic real -world scenarios, effective persona modeling necessitates leveraging streaming behavior data to continually optimize user personas. However, existing methods -whether regenerating personas or incrementally extending them with new behaviors -often fail to achieve sustained improvements in persona quality or future behavior prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose DEEPER, a novel approach for dynamic persona modeling that enables continual persona optimization. Specifically, we enhance the model's direction -search capability through an iterative reinforcement learning framework, allowing it to automatically identify effective update directions and optimize personas using discrepancies between user behaviors and model predictions. Extensive experiments on dynamic persona modeling involving 4800 users across 10 domains highlight the superior persona optimization capabilities of DEEPER, delivering an impressive 32.2% average reduction in user behavior prediction error over four update rounds -outperforming the best baseline by a remarkable 22.92%.

**Abstract:** Recent shifts in the space of large language model (LLM) research have shown an increasing focus on novel architectures to compete with prototypical Transformer-based models that have long dominated this space. Linear recurrent models have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational efficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to Transformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require recalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce Resona, a simple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with retrieval. Resona augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved information from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models demonstrate that Resona-augmented models observe significant performance gains on a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks, highlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the in-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the negation awareness of universal text embeddings, which is underexplored in existing literature, especially in light of prior studies revealing challenges in contextual embedding models.

**Method:** An in-depth analysis is conducted on various cutting-edge universal text embedding models to assess their ability to understand negation, followed by the proposal of a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. In-depth analysis of negation awareness in universal text embeddings.
	2. Development of a novel embedding re-weighting method to improve negation awareness.
	3. Demonstration of improved performance in negation tasks for language models.

**Result:** The findings indicate a significant lack of negation awareness in universal text embedding models, necessitating a re-weighting approach that significantly improves their performance on negation understanding tasks.

**Limitations:** The analysis primarily focuses on the awareness of negation, which may not account for other semantic aspects of natural language understanding.

**Conclusion:** The proposed embedding re-weighting method enhances negation awareness in text embedding models without altering their parameters and improves performance on various tasks involving negation.

**Abstract:** Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.
