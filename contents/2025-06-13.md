**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** interactive performance, audience agency, choreography, robotics, interaction design

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** DANCE² is an interactive dance where the audience influences a dancer-robot duet through real-time voting, revealing complexities in agency and interaction design.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the dynamics of audience agency in an interactive dance performance and its implications for choreography and interaction design.

**Method:** Audience members vote on the behavior of a wearable robot during key moments of a dance performance, collecting both qualitative surveys and quantitative voting data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of audience agency in performance art
	2. Analysis of real-time voting impact on interaction
	3. Reflection on design implications for digital systems

**Result:** Post-performance surveys indicated participants felt their choices significantly impacted the performance, while voting patterns showed surprising consistency across events.

**Limitations:** The study is based on limited performances and may not generalize to broader contexts.

**Conclusion:** The performance reveals the nuanced relationship between perceived agency, actual influence, and the design of interactive systems, suggesting insights applicable to algorithmically curated digital experiences.

**Abstract:** We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns. This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship, offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where agency is felt, but not exercised.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges students face in developing literacy with unfamiliar data visualization techniques, specifically PCPs.

**Method:** An intervention was conducted comparing two groups of students in a Data Visualization course: one using Mastery Learning and the other following a standard approach, focusing on their performance across different cognitive levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Mastery Learning to teach data visualization techniques
	2. Evaluation of its effectiveness through Bloom's Taxonomy
	3. Provision of educational materials for reproducibility

**Result:** Students in the Mastery Learning group scored higher in advanced modules (Analyze, Evaluate) compared to those in the standard group, indicating better comprehension of PCPs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mastery Learning enhances the understanding of complex concepts like PCPs by promoting deeper cognitive engagement in students.

**Abstract:** Developing literacy with unfamiliar data visualization techniques such as Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) can be a significant challenge for students. We adopted the Revised Bloom's taxonomy to instruct students on Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) using Mastery Learning in the classroom. To evaluate Mastery Learning's impact, we conducted an intervention in a Data Visualization course to teach students about PCPs using the Revised Bloom's taxonomy with and without Mastery Learning. Based on our intervention, we found that while students in both groups performed similarly on the first two (Remember, Understand) modules, the students in the Mastery Learning group performed better on modules that required more advanced thinking (Analyze, Evaluate) and demonstrated a better comprehension of PCPs. We provide all the materials developed including the six-module Bloom's Taxonomy PCP literacy (BTPL) test for full reproducibility on our website at https://vis-graphics.github.io/PCP-Literacy-Test/.

### [3] [Intergenerational AI Literacy in Korean Immigrant Families: Interpretive Gatekeeping Meets Convenient Critical Deferment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10197)

*Jeongone Seo, Ryan Womack, Tawfiq Ammari*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI literacy, immigrant families, intergenerational dynamics, cultural context, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This study explores how Korean immigrant families in the U.S. use AI tools, highlighting practices that shape engagement and suggesting design implications for equitable AI systems.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how immigrant families negotiate AI tools in the context of intergenerational, linguistic, and cultural challenges.

**Method:** Conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with parents and teens from Korean immigrant families.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of interpretive gatekeeping and convenient critical deferment practices
	2. Conceptual extension for intergenerational AI literacy
	3. Design implications for equitable and culturally attuned AI systems.

**Result:** Identified two practices: interpretive gatekeeping by parents and convenient critical deferment by teens, affecting AI engagement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AI literacy is a dynamic and relational practice informed by family negotiation rather than a purely skills-based approach.

**Abstract:** As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply integrated into family life, immigrant families must navigate unique intergenerational, linguistic, and cultural challenges. This study examines how Korean immigrant families in the United States negotiate the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT and smart assistants in their homes. Through 20 semi-structured interviews with parents and teens, we identify two key practices that shape their engagement: interpretive gatekeeping, where parents mediate their children's AI use through a lens of cultural and ethical values, and convenient critical deferment, where teens strategically postpone critical evaluation of AI for immediate academic and social utility. These intertwined practices challenge conventional, skills-based models of AI literacy, revealing it instead as a dynamic and relational practice co-constructed through ongoing family negotiation. We contribute to information science and HCI by offering a new conceptual extension for intergenerational AI literacy and providing design implications for more equitable, culturally attuned, and family-centered AI systems.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Artificial Intelligence, Creativity, Human-Computer Interaction, Distributed Creativity, Cognitive Science

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a taxonomy of how AI can enhance creativity by examining three modes of interaction between AI and humans: Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis.

**Read time:** 36 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand how AI can enhance human creativity through different forms of interaction.

**Method:** The authors adopt a conceptual framework to define and categorize the modes of creativity enhancement by AI, examining their implications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a taxonomy of AI's role in enhancing creativity.
	2. Examines the relational dynamics between human and AI agents in creative processes.
	3. Discusses implications across theoretical, ethical, and design dimensions.

**Result:** The modes of Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis influence levels of creativity, from problem-solving to innovation, with varied ethical and design implications.

**Limitations:** The paper does not present empirical studies to validate the proposed modes; it is mainly conceptual.

**Conclusion:** Understanding these modes can guide the development of AI systems that effectively augment human creativity while considering theoretical, ethical, and design dimensions.

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy, where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

**Conclusion:** The proposed system promotes digital inclusivity by offering autonomy to users who require it without imposing changes on others, allowing for a convergence of user autonomy, aesthetic integrity, and accessibility through choice.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a shift from compliance-centered web accessibility to a care-driven model that prioritizes user autonomy, using neurodivergent users as a catalyst case for broader personalization needs. While accessibility standards offer a flexible framework, they are often interpreted and implemented as static compliance checklists, our approach reframes it as a flexible, user-centered process. We introduce a customizable Comfort Mode framework that allows users to adapt interface settings, such as contrast, typography, motion, and scaling, according to their individual needs, while retaining the brand's core visual identity. Grounded in psychological and cognitive accessibility principles, our design supports personalization without sacrificing creative freedom. We present both minimal and advanced implementation models with mock-ups, demonstrating how inclusive design can be seamlessly integrated at minimal cost. This approach aims to broaden digital inclusivity by offering autonomy to those who require it, without imposing changes on those who do not. The proposed system is adaptable, scalable, and suitable for a wide range of users and brands, offering a new paradigm where user autonomy, aesthetic integrity, and accessibility converge not through compromise, but through choice.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Design spaces, Large language models, Decision-making framework, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Human-Computer Interaction

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces IDEA, a decision-making framework that enhances design intelligence by modeling design spaces and leveraging LLMs and MCTS for effective outcomes.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve decision-making in design processes through a structured representation of design spaces and computational support using AI techniques.

**Method:** IDEA employs a structured model of design spaces with orthogonal dimensions and discrete elements, leveraging LLMs for constraint generation and a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for design exploration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a structured representation of design spaces
	2. Introduction of the IDEA framework that integrates LLMs and MCTS
	3. Validation of IDEA through real-world design tasks

**Result:** IDEA was validated through two design scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability and capability to produce superior design outcomes compared to conventional methods.

**Limitations:** The framework's effectiveness may vary depending on domain-specific constraints and the quality of the input data.

**Conclusion:** The findings illustrate that IDEA can effectively enhance design decision-making and outcomes across various domains.

**Abstract:** Design spaces serve as a conceptual framework that enables designers to explore feasible solutions through the selection and combination of design elements. However, effective decision-making remains heavily dependent on the designer's experience, and the absence of mathematical formalization prevents computational support for automated design processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a structured representation that models design spaces with orthogonal dimensions and discrete selectable elements. Building on this model, we present IDEA, a decision-making framework for augmenting design intelligence through design space exploration to generate effective outcomes. Specifically, IDEA leverages large language models (LLMs) for constraint generation, incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by these constraints to explore the design space efficiently, and instantiates abstract decisions into domain-specific implementations. We validate IDEA in two design scenarios: data-driven article composition and pictorial visualization generation, supported by example results, expert interviews, and a user study. The evaluation demonstrates the IDEA's adaptability across domains and its capability to produce superior design outcomes.

**Abstract:** Coding forms a key part of computer science education in universities. As part of this education, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential tools for coding. However, it is currently unknown how the design of an IDE's interface impacts on students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).   In this study we investigated the use of IDEs by students with ADHD. We conducted a think aloud study with nine university computing students, followed by qualitative observational interviews to analyse their learning and engagement with the Visual Studio Code IDE. The paper reports on these experiences and seeks to understand the role IDEs play in the educational setting.   Our work also examines how digital accessibility and usability are considered in the current design of IDEs. We analysed the qualitative data using a thematic analysis and identified three primary themes: self-confidence, interaction, and learning as well as various sub-themes.   The themes and their sub-themes illustrate key areas of consideration when designing IDEs for students with ADHD. The primary findings highlight experiences of frustration and barriers in the current design and layout of IDEs.   Through our participatory approach we provide a rare insight into ADHD user experiences around usability and accessibility, and describe the need for better design of development environments to ensure a positive learning experience for the students.

Besides, the system supports synchronized text-animation previews and parametric adjustments via unified controls to improve editing workflow. A user study evaluates the system, highlighting its ability to help non-professional users complete animation workflows while validating the pipeline. The findings encourage further exploration of integrating LLMs into a comprehensive video creation workflow.

	3. Implications for designing adaptive user interfaces in interactive environments

**Result:** Simple LSTM networks achieved grasp prediction with a precision of better than 21 ms and distance measurement to objects with a precision of better than 1 cm; size of the target object predicted with over 97% accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Findings suggest significant potential for improving adaptive user interfaces in ubiquitous and mixed-reality environments through effective grasp intention prediction.

**Abstract:** The ability to predict the object the user intends to grasp offers essential contextual information and may help to leverage the effects of point-to-point latency in interactive environments. This paper explores the feasibility and accuracy of real-time recognition of uninstrumented objects based on hand kinematics during reach-to-grasp actions. In a data collection study, we recorded the hand motions of 16 participants while reaching out to grasp and then moving real and synthetic objects. Our results demonstrate that even a simple LSTM network can predict the time point at which the user grasps an object with a precision better than 21 ms and the current distance to this object with a precision better than 1 cm. The target's size can be determined in advance with an accuracy better than 97%. Our results have implications for designing adaptive and fine-grained interactive user interfaces in ubiquitous and mixed-reality environments.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** craft practices, human-computer interaction, knowledge sharing, improvisation, technical documentation

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a grammar for documenting improvisational craft practices, illustrated with the CraftLink interface, which aids in knowledge sharing among craftspeople.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the documentation of craft practices beyond linear steps by capturing the tacit knowledge necessary for improvisation and adaptation in crafts.

**Method:** The authors developed an elementary grammar for documenting improvisational actions, demonstrated via an interface called CraftLink that analyzes expert videos to generate documentation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a grammar for documenting improvisational craft actions
	2. Creation of the CraftLink interface for semi-automated documentation generation
	3. Evaluation of effectiveness through user studies with expert crocheters

**Result:** User studies with expert crocheters using CraftLink showed that the grammar effectively captures and facilitates sharing of expert knowledge, enhancing collaborative craft practices.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed grammar and CraftLink interface provide new ways for computational systems to support knowledge sharing in craft communities, preserving the sophistication of craft practices.

**Abstract:** Craft practices rely on evolving archives of skill and knowledge, developed through generations of craftspeople experimenting with designs, materials, and techniques. Better documentation of these practices enables the sharing of knowledge and expertise between sites and generations. However, most documentation focuses solely on the linear steps leading to final artifacts, neglecting the tacit knowledge necessary to improvise, or adapt workflows to meet the unique demands of each craft project. This omission limits knowledge sharing and reduces craft to a mechanical endeavor, rather than a sophisticated way of seeing, thinking, and doing. Drawing on expert interviews and literature from HCI, CSCW and the social sciences, we develop an elementary grammar to document improvisational actions of real-world craft practices. We demonstrate the utility of this grammar with an interface called CraftLink that can be used to analyze expert videos and semi-automatically generate documentation to convey material and contextual variations of craft practices. Our user study with expert crocheters (N=7) using this interface evaluates our grammar's effectiveness in capturing and sharing expert knowledge with other craftspeople, offering new pathways for computational systems to support collaborative archives of knowledge and practice within communities.

**Conclusion:** GAI technologies have the potential to foster meaningful social interactions, but there is a need for equitable design and inclusive evaluation practices.

**Abstract:** Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health, life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies.

**Conclusion:** Future research should explore how video features influence communication on social media, which could help develop better platforms for those managing illness experiences.

**Abstract:** Individuals with schizophrenia frequently experience intense emotions and often turn to vlogging as a medium for emotional expression. While previous research has predominantly focused on text based disclosure, little is known about how individuals construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences in video blogs. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing 200 YouTube videos created by individuals with schizophrenia. Drawing on media research and self presentation theories, we developed a visual analysis framework to disentangle these videos. Our analysis revealed diverse practices of emotion disclosure through both verbal and visual channels, highlighting the dynamic interplay between these modes of expression. We found that the deliberate construction of visual elements, including environmental settings and specific aesthetic choices, appears to foster more supportive and engaged viewer responses. These findings underscore the need for future large scale quantitative research examining how visual features shape video mediated communication on social media platforms. Such investigations would inform the development of care centered video sharing platforms that better support individuals managing illness experiences.

### [14] [Instance-Based Transfer Learning with Similarity-Aware Subject Selection for Cross-Subject SSVEP-Based BCIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10933)

*Ziwen Wang, Yue Zhang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Sheng Quan Xie, Alexander Lanzon, William P. Heath, Zhenhong Li*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** transfer learning, brain-computer interfaces, SSVEP, individual variability, task-related components

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel transfer learning framework for SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces that addresses individual variability in subjects' performance by utilizing both general and subject-specific features and includes a subject selection strategy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve the accuracy of SSVEP-based BCIs while reducing the need for extensive training data specific to the target subject by leveraging data from other subjects.

**Method:** The framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), extracts both subject-general and subject-specific features, and includes a method for selecting appropriate source subjects to mitigate negative transfer effects.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA) framework for BCIs
	2. Development of subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA) to enhance transfer learning
	3. Effective feature extraction addressing individual subject variability

**Result:** Comparative evaluations on multiple datasets show that the proposed iTRCA and subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA) frameworks significantly enhance performance, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving SSVEP-based BCI outcomes.

**Limitations:** The study may need further validation across diverse populations and additional tasks to ensure generalizability of the results.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that the iTRCA framework can lead to high-performance SSVEP-based BCIs with less required data from the target subject, potentially broadening the application of BCIs for non-expert users.

**Abstract:** Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can achieve high recognition accuracy with sufficient training data. Transfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements for the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however, effectively addressing individual variability among both target and source subjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which leverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual contributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general feature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a common latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the unique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we further design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA), which integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify appropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components (TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA frameworks.

**TL;DR:** Introducing Distortion-aware brushing, a new technique to improve cluster analysis in Multidimensional Projections (MDPs) by correcting distortions during user interactions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Conventional brushing in MDPs can lead to unreliable cluster analysis due to distortions that misrepresent cluster structures. There is a need for improved techniques to help users accurately brush and analyze multidimensional data.

**Method:** The paper presents a novel brushing technique called Distortion-aware brushing that dynamically adjusts the location of points as users brush, pulling closer those points near the brushed area and pushing away distant points to aid in accurate cluster separation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Distortion-aware brushing technique for MDPs
	2. Improvement in accuracy of cluster analysis in MD data
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness through user studies and practical use cases

**Result:** User studies with 24 participants indicate that Distortion-aware brushing significantly outperforms traditional brushing techniques in accurately separating clusters while being robust against distortions.

**Limitations:** The study is based on user testing with a limited number of participants (24), which may not fully represent all user demographics or experiences.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method not only enhances cluster analysis accuracy in geospatial data but also facilitates the interactive labeling of multidimensional clusters, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Brushing is a common interaction technique in 2D scatterplots, allowing users to select clustered points within a continuous, enclosed region for further analysis or filtering. However, applying conventional brushing to 2D representations of multidimensional (MD) data, i.e., Multidimensional Projections (MDPs), can lead to unreliable cluster analysis due to MDP-induced distortions that inaccurately represent the cluster structure of the original MD data. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel brushing technique for MDPs called Distortion-aware brushing. As users perform brushing, Distortion-aware brushing corrects distortions around the currently brushed points by dynamically relocating points in the projection, pulling data points close to the brushed points in MD space while pushing distant ones apart. This dynamic adjustment helps users brush MD clusters more accurately, leading to more reliable cluster analysis. Our user studies with 24 participants show that Distortion-aware brushing significantly outperforms previous brushing techniques for MDPs in accurately separating clusters in the MD space and remains robust against distortions. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through two use cases: (1) conducting cluster analysis of geospatial data and (2) interactively labeling MD clusters.

However, a holistic understanding of how people seek help for mental health problems remains limited, impeding the development of evidence-based intervention programs to facilitate help-seeking behavior. This study reviews current theories that guide empirical research on young adults' help-seeking behavior using technologies, identifies limitations in existing frameworks, and proposes directions for future research.   Methods: We searched databases that are most likely to contain mental health help-seeking practices in relation to information technology, including PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library.   Results: Of 2443 abstracts reviewed, 43 studies met the criteria and were included in the analysis. We identified 16 theories and models. They represent seven perspectives to view mental health help-seeking and reveal factors such as accessibility, stigma, and social support as key factors influencing help-seeking.   Limitations: We summarized the theories and models and categorized them based on their primary perspectives. Cross-perspective connections could be explored in future reviews.   Conclusions: A holistic approach to creating culturally sensitive multi-level interventions that consider individual, interpersonal, and community factors is needed to advance effective mental health help-seeking support strategies.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** LLM dependency, questionnaire validation, behavioral addiction, human-computer interaction, psychometrics

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents the LLM-D12, a validated questionnaire designed to measure dependency on large language models (LLMs), revealing two types of dependencies: Instrumental and Relationship.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of tools that accurately measure dependency on LLMs, as existing tools primarily rely on classic behavioral addiction symptoms.

**Method:** Developed a 12-item questionnaire (LLM-D12) based on theoretical work, validated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on a sample of 526 UK participants to establish its two-factor structure.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LLM-D12 questionnaire for measuring LLM dependency.
	2. Validation of the two-factor model distinguishing between Instrumental and Relationship Dependency.
	3. Empirical support for the nuanced understanding of LLM dependency beyond traditional addiction frameworks.

**Result:** The LLM-D12 demonstrated excellent internal consistency and validly distinguishes between Instrumental Dependency and Relationship Dependency.

**Limitations:** Further research is needed to assess the implications of LLM dependency in various contexts and among diverse populations.

**Conclusion:** Dependency on LLMs, as measured by the LLM-D12, reflects nuanced relationships that may not necessarily indicate dysfunction but can become problematic in some contexts.

**Abstract:** There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Semantic Degeneracy, Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Interpretation, Bayesian Methods

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the issue of semantic degeneracy in natural language, asserting that as complexity increases, LLMs struggle to recover intended meanings. It tests this with LLMs via a semantic Bell inequality test, suggesting Bayesian approaches may better characterize meaning.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of LLMs in interpreting complex natural language due to semantic degeneracy, and challenge the classical view of meaning in linguistic forms.

**Method:** Utilized Kolmogorov complexity and conducted a semantic Bell inequality test with various LLM agents interpreting ambiguous word pairs in different contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of non-classical contextuality in LLM interpretation of ambiguous language.
	2. Proposed shift from frequentist to Bayesian analytical frameworks for understanding linguistic meaning.
	3. Experimental validation of theoretical claims regarding semantic degeneracy and interpretation.

**Result:** Found average CHSH expectation values between 1.2 to 2.8, with some experiments significantly violating classical bounds, indicating non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This suggests the inadequacy of classical frequentist approaches, advocating for Bayesian methods to better characterize linguistic meaning in context.

**Abstract:** Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent (human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how different token-level realizations of prompts affect the responses of large language models while maintaining the same semantic intent.

**Method:** Introduction of the Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) framework to analyze behavioral drift across ten constrained tasks, examining variance in model-specific responses to semantically equivalent prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the PBSS framework for analyzing prompt variance in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of model-specific response shifts due to prompt rewording
	3. Identification of potential issues in model stability linked to tokenization and decoding dynamics.

**Result:** The PBSS framework revealed consistent and specific response shifts for various models, indicating that tokenization and decoding processes impact the stability of model responses to rephrased prompts.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to ten constrained tasks and may not generalize to all LLM applications.

**Conclusion:** The findings point to an overlooked aspect of model evaluation, emphasizing the role of tokenization and decoding strategies in the stability of language model responses post-training.

**Abstract:** We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks, PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to post-training quality of service instability.

**TL;DR:** ChartReasoner is a two-stage framework that enhances visual reasoning over charts by converting chart images into structured ECharts codes and synthesizing reasoning trajectories for better interpretation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve visual reasoning capabilities of large language models, particularly in tasks that require understanding intricate details in charts, which are often lost in traditional image-to-text conversions.

**Method:** A high-fidelity model first converts chart images into structured ECharts codes, preserving layout and data semantics. A synthesis pipeline then generates chart reasoning trajectories and filters low-quality samples. Finally, a multimodal model is trained using both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a two-stage framework specifically for chart reasoning
	2. Creation of a high-fidelity model for converting charts into structured codes
	3. Introduction of a data synthesis pipeline for generating and validating chart reasoning samples.

**Result:** Experimental results show that ChartReasoner performs comparably to state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters and approaches the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ChartReasoner effectively maintains original chart details and enhances reasoning capabilities, demonstrating significant progress in multimodal reasoning tasks involving charts.

**Abstract:** Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations, especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) for unsupervised fine-tuning.
	2. Demonstration of ICM's effectiveness on various benchmark tasks.

**Result:** ICM matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms crowdsourced human supervision, significantly improving the training of models like Claude 3.5.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ICM can effectively elicit the superhuman capabilities of language models and improve their training, resulting in better performance than traditional methods.

**Abstract:** To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However, for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally, we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how reliably LLMs can assess the nuances of empathic communication in text-based interactions, particularly in emotionally sensitive contexts.

**Method:** The research compares expert, crowdworker, and LLM annotations on empathic communication across four psychological and communication frameworks using data from 200 real-world conversations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Assessment of LLM performance against expert benchmarks in empathic communication.
	2. Demonstration of LLM reliability in comparison to crowdworker annotations.
	3. Identification of framework components influencing expert agreement.

**Result:** LLMs show a high level of agreement with expert annotations, surpassing crowdworker reliability, and their performance varies by framework components' clarity and subjectivity.

**Limitations:** The findings may vary across different contexts and types of conversations; further validation is needed.

**Conclusion:** LLMs can serve as valuable tools for ensuring transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications, particularly when validated against expert benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks, LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as conversational companions.

**Abstract:** Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand, especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using 22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis, we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost classifier, which uses decision trees.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of defined measurement or disclosure rules for Human Capital as a corporate asset.

**Method:** A machine learning algorithm (word2vec) is employed to create a comprehensive lexicon of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a comprehensive HC keyword lexicon
	2. Sharing of Python code for lexicon development

**Result:** The study produces a lexicon of HC keywords, a dataset of corporate HC disclosures, and Python code for utilizing this lexicon, including examples for BERT model fine-tuning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The lexicon and associated resources promote further research and exploration of Human Capital management and disclosure in corporate settings.

**Abstract:** Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation. Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to enhance understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by addressing challenges in evaluation methods and combining insights from computational narratology.

**Method:** A benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning was created, focusing on aspects such as causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict, using literature examples for assessment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Benchmark for evaluating LLMs in narrative planning.
	2. Insights into LLM story generation capabilities and limitations.
	3. Identification of challenges in producing quality narratives with LLMs.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrated that GPT-4 tier LLMs can produce causally sound stories on a small scale, but struggle with incorporating character intentionality and dramatic conflict, indicating a need for reinforcement learning in complex reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on small-scale story generation, which may not fully represent the capabilities of LLMs on larger narratives.

**Conclusion:** The findings offer insights into the scale of stories LLMs can generate while maintaining quality, highlighting both problem-solving behaviors and challenges in LLM narrative planning applications, particularly in gaming contexts.

**Abstract:** Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

**Conclusion:** The approach enhances the understanding of human queries and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining visual and auditory data for video retrieval.

**Abstract:** Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limited exploration of large reasoning models' capabilities in broader task domains beyond STEM, particularly in simple strategic games.

**Method:** Introduction of TTT-Bench, involving a programmatic approach to generate two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style game problems for evaluating reasoning in LRMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark (TTT-Bench) for reasoning models
	2. Showcasing the discrepancy in performance between math and reasoning tasks
	3. Proposing a scalable method for generating verifiable game problems

**Result:** State-of-the-art LRMs that excel in mathematical reasoning often struggle with the TTT-Bench games, showing a marked decrease in performance compared to established math benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The focus is on a narrow set of reasoning games and might not represent all reasoning abilities of LRMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a disparity in reasoning capabilities between complex math problems and simple strategic games, highlighting an area for further investigation.

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

**TL;DR:** This paper examines how well large language models (LLMs) assess empathic communication by comparing their performance with experts and crowdworkers across various frameworks.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the reliability of LLMs in judging nuances of empathic communication in text-based conversations.

**Method:** The study compares annotations of empathic communication made by experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs across four evaluative frameworks, using real-world conversations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of high expert agreement across different frameworks.
	2. Comparison of LLM performance against experts and crowd annotations.
	3. LLMs shown to exceed reliability of crowdworkers in assessing empathic communication.

**Result:** Expert agreement is high but varies based on the framework's characteristics; LLMs approach expert benchmarks and exceed crowdworker reliability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLMs validated on specific tasks can enhance transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks, LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as conversational companions.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** The evaluation shows significant challenges in identifying unreliable narrators, indicating the potential utility of LLMs in this area.

**Limitations:** The task of identifying unreliable narrators is shown to be challenging, indicating areas for improvement in LLM capabilities.

**Conclusion:** The authors release their dataset and code, encouraging further research into unreliable narrator classification with LLMs.

**Abstract:** Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

**Motivation:** To provide a high-quality synthetic dataset for hate-speech detection tailored to Portuguese and address the lack of such resources in low-resource settings.

**Method:** The dataset was created using a four-stage pipeline: starting with a curated seed, expanding using an LLM, augmenting via paraphrases, and enriching with additional neutral texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ToxSyn-PT corpus for Portuguese hate-speech analysis.

**Result:** Strong classification results were achieved in experiments on both binary and multi-label tasks across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating good generalization capabilities.

**Limitations:** The dataset may not cover all aspects of hate speech and may require further validation against real-world data.

**Conclusion:** ToxSyn-PT offers a valuable resource for advancing research in synthetic data and hate-speech detection, particularly in Portuguese and other low-resource contexts.

**Abstract:** We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and (4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks, experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.

### [34] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Language Models, Decision-Making, Bayesian Inference, Gibbs Sampling, Stochasticity

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates whether language models exhibit Bayesian decision-making, revealing that they can show deterministic behavior under certain conditions, which challenges previous assumptions about their probabilistic nature.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore the decision-making processes of language models and whether they align with Bayesian principles.

**Method:** The authors re-evaluate the assumption of stochasticity in language models' decision-making through simulated Gibbs sampling and conduct experiments with various large language models to analyze their decision patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Reevaluation of decision-making in language models with a focus on Bayesian principles
	2. Introduction of a method to differentiate between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling
	3. Experimental insights on decision-making behaviors across various large language models

**Result:** Findings indicate that language models can behave deterministically, producing maximum likelihood estimations even with a non-zero sampling temperature, and highlight the risks of inferring misleading priors in their decision-making processes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research raises critical questions about the assumed probabilistic nature of language models and suggests methods to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decisions, enhancing our understanding of their behavior.

**Abstract:** Language models are essentially probability distributions over token sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions. Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling, inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making, such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of large language models to identify their decision patterns under various circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision making of large language models.

**Keywords:** data selection, large language models, gradient-based methods, Upper Confidence Bound, multi-armed bandit

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents ClusterUCB, an efficient framework for data selection in the fine-tuning of large language models, using clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient data selection in supervised fine-tuning of large language models due to the high resource requirements of traditional gradient-based methods.

**Method:** Cluster the training data based on gradient features, then formulate the data selection as a constrained budget allocation problem addressed through a multi-armed bandit approach with a modified UCB algorithm.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a clustering approach for data selection
	2. Application of a modified UCB algorithm in a multi-armed bandit context
	3. Demonstrated reduced computational demands while achieving similar performance

**Result:** ClusterUCB demonstrates performance comparable to traditional gradient-based data selection methods while significantly decreasing computational resource usage.

**Limitations:** May not generalize across all types of datasets or domains; focused primarily on clustering-based approaches.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework significantly enhances the feasibility of efficient data selection during the fine-tuning process of large language models.

**Abstract:** Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models. However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences, we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing consumption.

### [36] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** deep learning, few-label classification, low-resource languages, pseudo-labeling, text classification

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Flick is a novel method for few-label text classification that improves pseudo-label quality in low-resource linguistic contexts by refining high-confidence labels from clusters, mitigating errors from noisy pseudo labels.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the challenges in few-label text classification, especially in low-resource languages, where traditional methods struggle with noise in pseudo-labels and overfitting due to complex models.

**Method:** Flick uses a pseudo-label refinement component that distills high-confidence pseudo-labels from a wide set of initial clusters, focusing on single-cluster cohesion and adaptive top-k selection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel pseudo-label refinement component
	2. Focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels
	3. Superior adaptability to low-resource languages

**Result:** Flick demonstrated superior performance across 14 datasets, including challenging languages like Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana, compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Flick effectively mitigates errors in low-resource data, allowing robust fine-tuning of pre-trained models with few true labels.

**Abstract:** Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data, allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and adaptability.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study explores how user suggestions influence Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings, identifying significant variations in response quality based on query framing, highlighting risks of sycophantic behavior, and suggesting implications for educational equity.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the impact of user-provided suggestions on the performance of LLMs in an educational context, particularly focusing on the risks associated with sycophantic behavior.

**Method:** The study tested five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 model classes under five experimental conditions, measuring response quality based on query framing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated how query framing affects LLM response quality in educational settings.
	2. Highlighted the differential impact of user suggestions on various model sizes.
	3. Outlined the implications of LLM biases for educational equity.

**Result:** LLM correctness can degrade by as much as 15 percentage points when students mention incorrect answers, while mentioning correct answers boosts accuracy by the same margin. Smaller models show a more pronounced bias, with effects of up to 30%.

**Limitations:** The study focused on a limited number of LLMs and experimental conditions, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of bias mechanisms in LLMs within educational contexts and the potential need for mitigative strategies to promote equitable learning outcomes.

**Abstract:** This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model, versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational context.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** speech-to-speech translation, large language models, modality adaptation, text-to-speech, scheduled interleaved training

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a new method for improving speech-to-speech translation using interleaved speech-text training with large language models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing speech-to-speech translation methods struggle with modality adaptation due to the predominance of text-only data in training LLMs, especially with limited speech data.

**Method:** The proposed approach employs scheduled interleaved speech-text training, using interleaved units where text tokens are mixed with speech units, progressively decreasing the text ratio as training advances.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of scheduled interleaved speech-text training for S2ST.
	2. Demonstration of improved performance using LLaMA3.2-1B on CVSS dataset.
	3. Method benefits low-resource languages significantly.

**Result:** Experiments conducted using LLaMA3.2-1B on the CVSS dataset show that this method leads to consistent improvements in S2ST performance, particularly for languages with scarce training resources.

**Limitations:** The approach may still require sufficient underlying speech data for effective training.

**Conclusion:** The scheduled interleaved training approach effectively addresses modality adaptation challenges and enhances translation effectiveness in low-resource settings.

**Abstract:** Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances, especially for languages with limited training data.

**Motivation:** Existing LLM frameworks struggle with complex data science tasks due to rigid workflows and do not leverage human expertise effectively.

**Method:** The paper introduces AutoMind, which utilizes an expert knowledge base, a knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy to enhance the automation of the machine learning pipeline.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A curated expert knowledge base for domain grounding
	2. A knowledgeable tree search algorithm for solution exploration

**Result:** Evaluations show that AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on automated data science benchmarks, demonstrating better effectiveness, efficiency, and solution quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AutoMind represents a significant advancement towards fully automating data science tasks by combining domain expertise with adaptive methodologies.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

**Conclusion:** The approach not only produces high-quality reasoning supervision but also enhances the efficiency of LLMs by reducing redundant processing during inference.

**Abstract:** Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

### [41] [TableRAG: A Retrieval Augmented Generation Framework for Heterogeneous Document Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10380)

*Xiaohan Yu, Pu Jian, Chong Chen*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Heterogeneous Document Processing, Multi-hop Reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents TableRAG, a framework for better handling heterogeneous documents in open-domain question answering, showing improvements over existing methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The existing RAG approaches face significant limitations when dealing with heterogeneous documents that include both textual and tabular components, leading to loss of information and weakened reasoning capabilities.

**Method:** TableRAG employs a hybrid approach that includes context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and execution, followed by compositional intermediate answer generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TableRAG framework for heterogeneous documents
	2. Development of HeteQA benchmark for multi-hop reasoning
	3. Demonstrable improvements over existing RAG methods.

**Result:** TableRAG consistently outperforms existing baseline methods on both public datasets and a newly introduced benchmark, HeteQA, which is designed for multi-hop heterogeneous reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed TableRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question answering and offers a framework that preserves tabular data integrity for improved reasoning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components, existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps: context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** PAG framework improves LLM self-correction by integrating verification and revision in a reinforcment learning setup.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing methods for improving the reliability of Large Language Models in verifying their own outputs.

**Method:** Proposes the Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG) framework that uses a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning paradigm, allowing LLMs to alternate between policy and verifier roles intelligently.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a selective revision mechanism for LLMs.
	2. Developed a unified framework for verification and correction in RL.
	3. Demonstrated enhanced reasoning and self-verification performance.

**Result:** Experiments show that PAG improves LLM self-correction accuracy and enhances reasoning and verification abilities compared to existing approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The verify-then-revise mechanism reduces model collapse and improves LLMs' generative capabilities and self-verification performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

**Abstract:** Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve reasoning efficiency in large language models by balancing conciseness and accuracy, addressing the shortcomings of existing techniques that often lead to longer outputs and increased latency.

**Method:** The study introduces a divided reward function and a novel penalty for output length to manage reasoning efficiency, promoting shorter outputs for simpler problems while preserving sufficient reasoning for complex ones.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a divided reward function for LLM reasoning efficiency
	2. Novel penalty for output length tailored to problem complexity

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By managing reasoning efficiency with a tailored reward structure, the model demonstrated enhanced performance, indicating a viable path for optimizing LLM reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024 dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** claim verification, table-text alignment, explanation task, human-annotated rationales, large language models

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses the limitations of scientific claim verification using tables by reframing it as an explanation task that identifies essential table cells for supporting claims.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for claim verification do not provide sufficient reasoning or interpretability, as they only focus on predicting labels without explaining the rationale behind them.

**Method:** The authors extended the SciTab benchmark by creating a new dataset with human-annotated cell-level rationales, where annotators highlight crucial table cells that support their verification decisions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new dataset with human-annotated cell-level rationales for claim verification against tables.
	2. Development of a taxonomy for addressing ambiguous verification cases.
	3. Demonstration of improved performance in claim verification by utilizing table alignment information.

**Result:** Incorporating table alignment information into the verification process improved performance, but many LLMs struggle to align their predictions with human reasoning despite achieving correct labels.

**Limitations:** The model's ability to recover human-aligned rationales remains limited, indicating a gap in faithfully replicating human reasoning in LLM predictions.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests the need for models to not only predict claim labels but also to provide transparent rationales, which is crucial for interpretability in scientific claim verification.

**Abstract:** Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the biases inherent in large language models due to their training on controversial and stereotypical content, and how these biases manifest based on user personas and tasks.

**Method:** The study evaluates various proxy measures of bias in LLMs by using a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU) and analyzing performance across different tasks such as user grading and salary negotiation advice.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of proxy measures of bias in LLMs
	2. Identification of significant bias in user grading tasks
	3. Assessment of bias in salary negotiation advice from LLMs

**Result:** The findings indicate minimal bias when models assess pre-prompted persona outputs; however, more significant bias emerges in user grading tasks and notably in responses to salary negotiation inquiries.

**Limitations:** The study may have limitations in the generalizability of the benchmarking approach and the specific tasks evaluated.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the implications of LLM personalization and memory features, suggesting that user socio-demographics could influence the model's responses without explicit prompting.

**Abstract:** Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models express biased points of view or produce different results based on the assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer, this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the description of their persona since the model already knows their socio-demographics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluated LLMs in multi-user dialogue state tracking scenarios.
	2. Developed a method for generating second user utterances based on speech act theory.

**Result:** The experiments show a notable performance drop in LLMs when applied to multi-user dialogue state tracking compared to single-user settings.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on performance drop without exploring specific causes or solutions.

**Conclusion:** Enhancements are needed to improve LLM robustness in multi-user dialogue state tracking for practical applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings. Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

**Motivation:** Large language models face challenges in knowledge-intensive tasks due to limited background knowledge and hallucination tendencies. The paper aims to enhance reasoning by refining relationships in knowledge graphs (KGs).

**Method:** The RRP framework combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information from relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning to extract and evaluate reasoning paths from KGs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the RRP framework for refining reasoning paths from KGs
	2. Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on public datasets

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, outperforming existing baseline methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RRP can be integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a user-friendly manner, providing high-quality reasoning paths for specific questions.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself. Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

**Result:** Experimental evaluations show significant improvements in character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility when reconstructing Latin protoforms from Romance language cognates.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed model successfully enhances the reconstruction of ancestral word forms through a combination of statistical and rule-based approaches.

**Abstract:** We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e., ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how LLMs manage character-level tasks, which are simple for humans but challenging for these models, particularly in identifying subcomponents within tokens.

**Method:** The authors conduct analyses using probing classifiers, knowledge neuron identification, and attention weight inspection to study the internal character-level information utilization in LLMs during spelling tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of character-level information representation in LLMs
	2. Identification of reliance on intermediate and higher layers for character reconstruction
	3. Validation through multiple analytical approaches (probing, knowledge neurons, attention inspection)

**Result:** The study finds that LLMs do not fully encode character-level information in the embedding layer, necessitating reliance on intermediate and higher Transformer layers for effective spelling, with a noticeable improvement at one stage of this process.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in handling character-level information and emphasize the importance of certain Transformer layers in their spelling capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that, although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct "breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

**Result:** LLMs, particularly Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods in detecting life-threatening language, especially in both balanced and imbalanced datasets.

**Limitations:** The study's findings on the impact of upsampling on LLMs indicate that further research is needed to fully understand its effects on language models.

**Conclusion:** LLMs show great potential for real-world applications in detecting life-threatening language, highlighting the effectiveness of fine-tuning in addressing this critical issue.

**Abstract:** Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

### [56] [PREMISE: Scalable and Strategic Prompt Optimization for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning in Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10716)

*Ye Yu, Yaoning Yu, Haohan Wang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large reasoning models, prompt optimization, Mathematical inference, token efficiency, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Introduces PREMISE, a prompt-only framework for efficient mathematical inference that reduces token usage and cost while maintaining accuracy in large reasoning models (LRMs).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the verbosity and high token consumption of chain-of-thought reasoning in large reasoning models, which limits their deployment in sensitive environments.

**Method:** PREMISE utilizes prompt-based optimization techniques to minimize redundant computations and streamline the reasoning process in black-box, commercial LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the PREMISE framework for prompt optimization in LLMs.
	2. Significant reduction in token usage and cost while maintaining high accuracy.
	3. Demonstrated applications on standard mathematical benchmark datasets.

**Result:** On benchmarks like GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500, PREMISE reduces reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, thereby significantly decreasing costs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PREMISE exemplifies a practical method for enhancing the efficiency of LRM inference without sacrificing reasoning quality.

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy ($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by $69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.

**Keywords:** ClaimSpect, hierarchical aspects, retrieval-augmented generation, nuanced claims, perspective analysis

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** ClaimSpect is a framework that dissects nuanced claims into hierarchical aspects to provide structured, corpus-specific perspectives, enhancing understanding and validation of claims.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Nuanced claims in science and politics are hard to label as simply true or false, necessitating a structured approach to assess their various aspects.

**Method:** The framework retrieves and constructs a hierarchy of aspects from an input corpus, aiding in the discovery of sub-aspects and varying perspectives toward a claim.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the ClaimSpect framework for hierarchical claim analysis.
	2. Integration of retrieval-augmented generation for corpus-specific perspectives.
	3. Validation of approach through real-world case studies and human evaluation.

**Result:** ClaimSpect shows robustness and accuracy in deconstructing and representing perspectives on scientific and political claims in a constructed dataset.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Through real-world case studies and human evaluations, ClaimSpect demonstrates its effectiveness, outperforming multiple baselines in handling nuanced claims.

**Abstract:** Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects (e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects. Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** TaxoAdapt is a proposed framework that improves upon traditional and automatic taxonomy construction methods by dynamically adapting an LLM-generated taxonomy to a specific corpus, accommodating the multi-dimensional nature of scientific literature, and demonstrating superior performance in hierarchical classification.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenges of organizing and retrieving scientific literature in rapidly evolving fields, highlighting the limitations of existing expert-curated and automatic taxonomy methods.

**Method:** TaxoAdapt utilizes a process of iterative hierarchical classification to expand the taxonomy in both width and depth, according to the topical distribution of the corpus.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Dynamic adaptation of LLM-generated taxonomies to specific corpora
	2. Iterative hierarchical classification for enhanced taxonomy detail
	3. Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in organizing scientific literature

**Result:** The framework outperforms existing methods, achieving taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent as judged by LLMs, across various computer science conferences.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TaxoAdapt effectively structures and captures the evolution of scientific fields in a more nuanced way compared to previous approaches.

**Abstract:** The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive baselines judged by LLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective multilingual LLMs amidst challenges like limited model capacity, scarce data, and compute constraints.

**Method:** Systematic experiments comparing a universal tokenizer trained for more languages to traditional tokenizers focused on pretraining languages, assessing language adaptation capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a universal tokenizer for improved multilingual adaptation
	2. Demonstrates significant improvement in language plasticity post-training
	3. Provides empirical evidence through systematic experiments across diverse language groups

**Result:** The universal tokenizer showed a notable increase in adaptation capabilities, yielding up to a 20.2% increase in win rates for new languages and a 5% gain for completely unseen languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adopting a universal tokenizer facilitates broader language adaptation with minimal loss in performance for languages covered during pretraining.

**Abstract:** Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining, by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages included in pretraining.

**Motivation:** Improving accuracy of ASR systems for named entities, which are critical for many applications.

**Method:** Introduced a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to correct named entity recognition using reasoning and local context from lecture notes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. LLM revision mechanism for ASR named entities
	2. NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset introduction

**Result:** Achieved up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed LLM revision approach significantly enhances ASR performance on named entities, crucial for downstream applications.

**Abstract:** With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs without degrading their performance due to parameter interference.

**Method:** LangEdit employs a null-space constrained framework that projects updates onto the orthogonal complement of previously updated subspaces to ensure independence of language-specific knowledge updates.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel framework (LangEdit) for multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs.
	2. Mathematical guarantee of update independence through null-space projections.
	3. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and languages, showcasing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

**Result:** LangEdit demonstrates superior performance in maintaining multilingual generalization and accuracy across three models, six languages, and four tasks, outperforming existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LangEdit is a promising solution for enabling efficient multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs, preserving both factual consistency and model performance.

**Abstract:** Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs), while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces. This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks, demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/VRCMF/LangEdit.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs while mitigating the issue of overthinking, which leads to lengthy or redundant reasoning traces.

**Method:** ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths and train specialized LLMs for accuracy and brevity.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** ReCUT reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50% while maintaining or enhancing reasoning accuracy across multiple datasets.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness depends on the datasets used for training and evaluation.

**Conclusion:** The integrated ReCUT model provides a more efficient reasoning process for LLMs, enhancing both the accuracy and conciseness of outputs.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing sampling strategies for diffusion-based language models suffer from static behavior, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance.

**Method:** The proposed SlowFast Sampling alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages, guided by principles of certainty, convergence, and positional adjustments. It also integrates with dLLM-Cache to minimize redundant computations.

**Key Contributions:**

	3. Integration with caching for improved efficiency

**Result:** SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA and up to 34.22× when combined with caching, outperforming autoregressive models like LLaMA3 8B in throughput with minimal accuracy loss.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Well-designed sampling strategies such as SlowFast Sampling can significantly enhance the performance of diffusion-based language models for fast and high-quality text generation.

**Abstract:** Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

**Motivation:** To investigate how wav2vec2 models trained on different languages encode various types of information beyond English, focusing on phones, lexical tones, and speaker information.

**Method:** The study employs probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine representations in wav2vec2 models across four languages, analyzing the orthogonality of encoded subspaces.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examines wav2vec2 representation in multiple languages
	2. Discovers orthogonality in encoding phones, tones, and speakers
	3. Provides insights into layerwise probing accuracy patterns

**Result:** The findings reveal that for all tested languages, representations of phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, with similar probing accuracy patterns across layers, showing a slight advantage for matched-language probes in late layers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the structure of wav2vec2 representations is mostly independent of the pretraining speech material, indicating robustness across different languages.

**Abstract:** Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

**Conclusion:** Fine-tuning can significantly boost model capabilities in specific domains without extensive computational resources, emphasizing the need for appropriate dataset-task alignment.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1) commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3) multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).   Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2) performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

**Keywords:** large language models, human-computer interaction, machine learning, knowledge injection, out-of-context reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates out-of-context reasoning (OCR) in large language models (LLMs), linking it to both generalization and hallucination of information.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the dual behaviors of LLMs, specifically why they generalize from new knowledge but also hallucinate information, is crucial for improving their reliability and performance.

**Method:** The authors conduct experiments on five prominent LLMs to explore OCR and formalize it as a synthetic factual recall task, demonstrating the effects of matrix factorization in transformer architectures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies out-of-context reasoning as a central mechanism for LLM generalization and hallucination.
	2. Formalizes OCR as a factual recall task with implications for transformer design.
	3. Demonstrates the impact of matrix factorization on model learning capabilities.

**Result:** Their findings indicate that a one-layer transformer with factorized matrices successfully learns OCR, while one with combined weights does not, revealing insights into the implicit biases in training.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study provides a theoretical basis for OCR in LLMs, suggesting that enhancing understanding of this mechanism can help mitigate inaccuracies in knowledge injection.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information. However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

**Abstract:** Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base (150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

### [71] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)

*Lan Zhang, Marco Valentino, Andre Freitas*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** autoformalization, large language models, formal mathematics, evaluation, human-computer interaction

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a systematic method for automatically evaluating autoformalization tasks in formal mathematics using an ensemble of large language models (LLM) as judges, focusing on nuanced evaluation criteria.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve the evaluation of autoformalization tasks in advanced mathematics, where traditional human evaluation is time-consuming and requires substantial expertise.

**Method:** The paper proposes an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined by criteria such as logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality, to assess autoformalization tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a systematic method for LLMs to evaluate autoformalization tasks.
	2. Developed a new ensemble framework that considers nuanced evaluation criteria.
	3. Demonstrated improved correlation with human assessments in formal mathematics evaluation.

**Result:** Experiments show that the EFG ensemble correlates better with human assessments compared to conventional methods, particularly in evaluating formal qualities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that LLMs can effectively support the evaluation of formal mathematical reasoning when guided by a well-defined set of criteria.

**Abstract:** Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise, especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced, multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Magistral Medium demonstrates the effectiveness of RL training for reasoning tasks, and they have made Magistral Small available as an open-source model.

**Abstract:** We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model, and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data from Magistral Medium.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** interpretability, large language models, matrix factorization, causal evaluation, feature extraction

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to identify interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing activation directions, outperforming existing methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve mechanistic interpretability in LLMs by finding interpretable features from activation space without relying on neurons alone.

**Method:** The authors use semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations, producing sparse linear combinations that are directly interpretable and tied to inputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces SNMF as a novel method for interpretable feature extraction in LLMs.
	2. Demonstrates SNMF's efficacy over existing methods in causal evaluations and interpretability.
	3. Reveals hierarchical organization of neuron combinations linked to semantic features.

**Result:** SNMF derived features demonstrate better performance than sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and other traditional methods in causal evaluations, aligning well with human interpretations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SNMF serves as an effective approach for feature identification in LLMs, revealing hierarchical structures in activation space and enhancing interpretability.

**Abstract:** A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here, we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features, exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together, these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the concept of dynamic epistemic friction in human-AI collaborations, particularly in dialogue. It defines epistemic friction as the resistance to integrating new beliefs in response to conflicting information and analyzes how this resistance can predict belief updates during situated collaborative tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gaps in existing approaches to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by incorporating the concept of dynamic epistemic friction in belief revision during collaboration.

**Method:** The paper employs Dynamic Epistemic Logic to model dynamic epistemic friction and presents analyses from a situated collaborative task, predicting belief updates in dialogues based on this model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition and framework of dynamic epistemic friction in belief revision
	2. Analyses predicting belief updates during collaboration tasks
	3. Framework for refining models of belief alignment in dialogue scenarios

**Result:** The analysis shows that the proposed model of epistemic friction effectively predicts how individuals update their beliefs during dialogues, reflecting the complexities inherent in real-world communications.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating dynamic epistemic friction into models of belief alignment provides a nuanced understanding of belief integration in dialogue, suggesting pathways for improving human-AI collaboration.

**Abstract:** Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of "epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit, 2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the performance of language models by aligning training and validation data distributions using a new framework called Domain2Vec.

**Method:** Domain2Vec decomposes datasets into meta-domains and creates domain vectors that capture key features, optimizing data mixtures for language model pretraining based on the Distribution Alignment Assumption (DA²).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of meta-domains for dataset decomposition
	2. Establishment of the Distribution Alignment Assumption (DA²) for better training and validation alignment
	3. Significant reduction in computational requirements for language model training while enhancing performance

**Result:** Domain2Vec achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only 51.5% of the computation of the original mixture of The Pile dataset, improving downstream performance by an average of 2.83%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Domain2Vec is efficient and can be integrated into existing frameworks to enhance model performance with minimal computational resources.

**Abstract:** We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. \textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, \textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only $51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AutoMind represents a substantial advancement toward fully automating data science by effectively combining human expertise with LLM capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the self-reevaluation capabilities of reasoning models when exposed to unhelpful thoughts, revealing shortcomings in their ability to recover from these thoughts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how reasoning models can better identify and recover from unhelpful thoughts, which is essential for improving their accuracy and reliability.

**Method:** The study examines how reasoning models handle four types of unhelpful thoughts and measures their performance in identifying and recovering from these when injected into their reasoning process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of four types of unhelpful thoughts in reasoning models
	2. Demonstration of performance drop when models face injected irrelevant thoughts
	3. Highlighting inverse-scaling trends among different model sizes

**Result:** Models effectively identify most unhelpful thoughts, but struggle to recover from them, leading to performance drops; larger models demonstrate inverse-scaling trends, struggling more than smaller ones with irrelevant thoughts.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on specific types of unhelpful thoughts and may not encompass all reasoning failures; external factors influencing model performance were not fully explored.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for improving self-reevaluation mechanisms in reasoning models to create more reliable AI systems.

**Abstract:** Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness. Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection, showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better reasoning and safer systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ConvD demonstrates significant advancements in knowledge graph completion and model efficiency with reduced parameters and improved performance.

**Abstract:** Knowledge graphs often suffer from incompleteness issues, which can be alleviated through information completion. However, current state-of-the-art deep knowledge convolutional embedding models rely on external convolution kernels and conventional convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model, ConvD, which directly reshapes relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels. This approach effectively enhances the feature interactions between relation embeddings and entity embeddings. Simultaneously, we incorporate a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism that assigns different contribution weight coefficients to the multiple relation convolution kernels in dynamic convolution, further boosting the expressive power of the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 3.28% to 14.69% across all model evaluation metrics, while the number of parameters is reduced by 50.66% to 85.40% compared to other state-of-the-art models.

	2. Demonstration of its efficiency on open-source LLMs
	3. Initial proposal for a defense strategy against this type of attack

**Result:** The method increases the misalignment rate to over 99% across two datasets with just a single forward pass, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in aligned LLMs.

**Limitations:** Creating more advanced defenses remains a significant challenge beyond the initial proposals made in the study.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore serious safety issues in current LLM alignments and propose the need for advanced defensive strategies against such attacks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

**Keywords:** large multimodal models, visual perception, Primal Visual Description, Scalable Vector Graphics, zero-shot generalization

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM) to enhance large multimodal models' (LMMs) ability to bridge low-level visual perception and high-level reasoning by translating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) into a structured, text-based description known as Primal Visual Description (PVD).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in tasks requiring precise visual perception and high-level reasoning, particularly in the context of vector graphics.

**Method:** The authors introduce a new model, the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which translates SVG images into an intermediate representation called Primal Visual Description (PVD), capturing essential attributes of visual elements. This method facilitates understanding by LMMs and uses task-agnostic synthesized data for training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Primal Visual Description (PVD) for translating SVGs into text-based abstractions.
	2. Demonstrated improvements in LMMs on perception and reasoning tasks without human-annotated data.
	3. Increased interpretability of visual and reasoning tasks through the structured representation of visual primitives.

**Result:** VDLM significantly enhances the efficacy of state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4o, on multiple multimodal perception and reasoning challenges, demonstrating improved interpretability and performance without the need for human-annotated data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed VDLM with PVD representation leads to better zero-shot generalization in multimodal tasks and a positive correlation between the quality of the PVD and task performance.

**Abstract:** Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To combat the rise of hate speech in Indonesia, especially against marginalized groups, due to the lack of labeled data.

**Method:** The study provides a dataset of 43,692 entries annotated by diverse individuals and establishes baselines for binary classification tasks using the IndoBERTweet model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of IndoToxic2024 dataset for Indonesian hate speech
	2. Establishment of baseline scores for classification tasks
	3. Insights on the impact of demographic information on model performance

**Result:** Achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.78 for hate speech classification and demonstrated enhanced zero-shot performance by incorporating demographic information into a large language model.

**Limitations:** Overemphasis on demographic information can negatively impact the model's performance due to data fragmentation.

**Conclusion:** The dataset addresses critical gaps in hate speech detection, but care is needed to balance demographic information in model training to avoid performance degradation.

**Abstract:** Hate speech poses a significant threat to social harmony. Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of the large language model, gpt-3.5-turbo. However, we also caution that an overemphasis on demographic information can negatively impact the fine-tuned model performance due to data fragmentation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To test the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NEPA-related federal decision-making processes, as current evaluations in this specific domain are lacking.

**Method:** The authors created the NEPAQuAD benchmark derived from Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and developed an evaluation pipeline called MAPLE to assess LLM performance on NEPA regulatory reasoning tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the NEPAQuAD benchmark for LLM evaluation in environmental contexts.
	2. Development of the MAPLE evaluation pipeline for regulatory reasoning tasks.
	3. Insights into LLM performance and context utilization in handling NEPA documents.

**Result:** The evaluation showed that models perform best when provided with relevant context, and RAG-based approaches outperformed others in long-context scenarios.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on a limited number of state-of-the-art LLMs and may not generalize to all models or domains.

**Conclusion:** NEPA-specific regulatory reasoning tasks present significant challenges for LLMs, especially regarding complex semantics and lengthy documents.

**Abstract:** The National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) stands as a foundational piece of environmental legislation in the United States, requiring federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions. The primary mechanism for achieving this is through the preparation of Environmental Assessments (EAs) and, for significant impacts, comprehensive Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Large Language Model (LLM)s' effectiveness in specialized domains like NEPA remains untested for adoption in federal decision-making processes. To address this gap, we present NEPA Question and Answering Dataset (NEPAQuAD), the first comprehensive benchmark derived from EIS documents, along with a modular and transparent evaluation pipeline, MAPLE, to assess LLM performance on NEPA-focused regulatory reasoning tasks. Our benchmark leverages actual EIS documents to create diverse question types, ranging from factual to complex problem-solving ones. We built a modular and transparent evaluation pipeline to test both closed- and open-source models in zero-shot or context-driven QA benchmarks. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs using our framework to assess both their prior knowledge and their ability to process NEPA-specific information. The experimental results reveal that all the models consistently achieve their highest performance when provided with the gold passage as context. While comparing the other context-driven approaches for each model, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approaches substantially outperform PDF document contexts, indicating that neither model is well suited for long-context question-answering tasks. Our analysis suggests that NEPA-focused regulatory reasoning tasks pose a significant challenge for LLMs, particularly in terms of understanding the complex semantics and effectively processing the lengthy regulatory documents.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** uncertainty quantification, large language models, demographic subgroups, calibration, conformal prediction

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores uncertainty quantification methods for long-form text generated by large language models, focusing on individual claims and entire outputs across demographic subgroups.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The issue of whether uncertainty guarantees for LLM outputs persist within subgroups of data has not been thoroughly investigated.

**Method:** The study uses biography generation as a testbed, applying both calibration and conformal prediction methods to evaluate uncertainty across individual claims and overall output, while categorizing data into demographic subgroups.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifying breakdown of uncertainty guarantees in subgroup contexts
	2. Demonstrating the efficacy of group-conditional methods for uncertainty quantification
	3. Providing a benchmark for long-form text generation analysis

**Result:** Canonical methods perform well across the entire dataset but fail to maintain uncertainty guarantees within specific subgroups. Group-conditional methods improve performance for subgroup analysis.

**Limitations:** The focus is on demographic subgroups related to biography generation; other potential subgroupings need to be investigated.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of subgroup information for effective uncertainty quantification and establish a benchmark for further research in this area.

**Abstract:** While past works have shown how uncertainty quantification can be applied to large language model (LLM) outputs, the question of whether resulting uncertainty guarantees still hold within sub-groupings of data remains open. In our work, given some long-form text generated by an LLM, we study uncertainty at both the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Using biography generation as a testbed for this study, we derive a set of (demographic) attributes (e.g., whether some text describes a man or woman) for each generation to form such "subgroups" of data. We find that although canonical methods for both types of uncertainty quantification perform well when measuring across the entire dataset, such guarantees break down when examining particular subgroups. Having established this issue, we invoke group-conditional methods for uncertainty quantification -- multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction -- and find that across a variety of approaches, additional subgroup information consistently improves calibration and conformal prediction within subgroups (while crucially retaining guarantees across the entire dataset). As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these results to form a benchmark for this setting.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of individual large language models (LLMs) in generalization and performance due to biases, size constraints, and dataset quality.

**Method:** SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and a selection policy based on predictions and confidence scores to determine the optimal subset of LLMs for specific queries.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** SelectLLM outperforms existing ensemble-based methods and achieves competitive performance with top-performing LLMs, significantly reducing inference latency, achieving 13% less on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that SelectLLM not only enhances performance efficiency but also narrows the performance gap compared to an Oracle model.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.

**Motivation:** To automate and enhance the process of dataset generation for Preference Optimization by utilizing LLMs instead of human annotators.

**Method:** The methodology consists of two modules: response evaluation, where LLMs are used to rank responses via different prompting strategies; and response generation, which employs multi-model configurations for dataset creation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of multi-model workflows for dataset generation
	2. Automation of response evaluation using LLMs
	3. Demonstration of enhanced win rates through optimal model configurations

**Result:** The study identifies that the combination of Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer in the LLM Feedback Loop achieved win rates of 71.8% and 73.8%, respectively, against single models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework effectively creates synthetic PO datasets that can improve the efficiency of dataset generation processes.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-model workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for more effective identification of watermark segments in longer texts to combat misuse of AI-generated content.

**Method:** The authors propose a geometry cover detection framework and an adaptive online learning algorithm to locate watermarked segments in texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a geometry cover detection framework for watermark segment identification.
	2. Developed an adaptive online learning algorithm for precise watermark location detection.
	3. Showed high accuracy in detection across multiple watermarking techniques.

**Result:** The proposed methods were evaluated on three watermarking techniques, achieving high accuracy and greatly surpassing baseline methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework demonstrates adaptability to various watermarking techniques, providing significant insights for watermark detection.

**Abstract:** Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to detect synthetic text, mitigating misuse cases like fake news and academic dishonesty. While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach highlights the interconnectedness of model layers and provides a powerful tool for analyzing LLM behavior through topological data analysis.

**Abstract:** Understanding the decision-making processes of large language models is critical given their widespread applications. To achieve this, we aim to connect a formal mathematical framework -- zigzag persistence from topological data analysis -- with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes, persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the system-level perspective.

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore how many-shot ICL can better assess LCLMs, particularly what types of tasks benefit from more examples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MANYICLBENCH benchmark for ICL evaluation
	2. Categorization of ICL tasks into SSL and ASL
	3. Analysis of model performance across various long-context tasks

**Result:** Results indicate that classification and summarization tasks improve with more demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not show clear benefits; performance drops are noted in ASL tasks at lower token counts.

**Limitations:** The paper primarily focuses on benchmarking and may not address underlying model architecture issues affecting performance.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of MANYICLBENCH provides a new framework for evaluating LCLMs, highlighting the importance of task categorization in understanding model performance in long-context settings.

**Abstract:** Many-shot in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a unique setup to both utilize and test the ability of large language models to handle long context. This paper delves into long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot ICL. We first ask: what types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and how effective are they in evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and summarization tasks show performance improvements with additional demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear trends. Next, we investigate the extent to which different tasks necessitate retrieval versus global context understanding. We develop metrics to categorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) similar-sample learning (SSL): tasks where retrieval of the most similar examples is sufficient for good performance, and (ii) all-sample learning (ASL): tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of all examples in the prompt. Lastly, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark, MANYICLBENCH, to characterize model's ability on both fronts and benchmark 12 LCLMs using MANYICLBENCH. We find that while state-of-the-art models demonstrate good performance up to 64k tokens in SSL tasks, many models experience significant performance drops at only 16k tokens in ASL tasks.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes Squeezed Attention, an optimization method for large language models (LLMs) that reduces the computational cost of processing long input contexts by leveraging offline K-means clustering and hierarchical attention techniques.

**Read time:** 22 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Long input contexts in LLM applications pose significant challenges in terms of inference efficiency, as the cost increases with sequence length. There is an opportunity for optimization when a large part of the input context remains fixed across different user inputs.

**Method:** The proposed method groups fixed context keys using K-means clustering based on semantic similarity and uses centroids for inference, allowing relevance prediction of the keys which reduces the computational burden significantly. A hierarchical approach further decreases complexity from linear to logarithmic concerning context length.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Squeezed Attention for LLMs
	2. Offline optimization through K-means clustering of fixed context keys
	3. Implementation of hierarchical attention reducing complexity from linear to logarithmic

**Result:** The method achieves a 3.1× reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8× reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy loss across various LLaMA-2 and Longchat models. Speed improvements of over 4× are realized during prefill and generation phases with the implemented kernels.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Squeezed Attention provides a mechanism to efficiently handle long-context LLM applications, demonstrating significant reductions in resource consumption without sacrificing model performance.

**Abstract:** Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input context in order to perform complex tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations in order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also present a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context length. We evaluate our method on long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3.1$\times$ reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8$\times$ reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy gap for the LLaMA-2-7B-32K, LWM-Text-Chat-1M, and Longchat-7B-v1.5-32K models. Futhermore, we implement kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4$\times$ speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference.

**Method:** PuDDing employs a lightweight router trained to determine which transformer blocks to omit based on input prompts, constructed in a data-driven manner.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dynamic pruning method that adapts to input prompts.
	2. Empirical validation showing improved inference speed and task performance.
	3. Development of a lightweight router for predicting optimal block omission.

**Result:** Empirical tests show that PuDDing accelerates inference for language models and provides better performance on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to static pruning methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PuDDing demonstrates an effective method for dynamic depth pruning that tailors model inference to specific tasks, leading to both efficiency and improved accuracy.

**Abstract:** Depth pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of a large language model without any hardware-specific complications, by simply removing several less important transformer blocks. However, our empirical findings suggest that the importance of a transformer block may be highly task-dependent -- a block that is crucial for a task can be removed without degrading the accuracy on another task. Based on this observation, we develop a dynamic depth pruning algorithm, coined PuDDing (Prompt-routed Dynamic Depth Pruning), which determines which blocks to omit from the model based on the input prompt. PuDDing operates by training a lightweight router to predict the best omission set among a set of options, where this option set has also been constructed in a data-driven manner. Empirical results on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PuDDing effectively accelerates the inference language models, and achieves better on-task performance than static depth pruning baselines.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces BeamLoRA, a new approach to fine-tuning large language models that improves upon the conventional Low-Rank Adaptation method by dynamically optimizing sub-solution combinations.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need to improve the accuracy of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA while maintaining their efficiency.

**Method:** BeamLoRA conceptualizes LoRA modules as beams with each rank representing potential sub-solutions, dynamically adjusting during fine-tuning to optimize performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BeamLoRA for dynamic optimization of LoRA modules
	2. Empirical validation demonstrating improved performance on various tasks
	3. Insights into the importance and dynamics of LoRA ranks during fine-tuning

**Result:** BeamLoRA consistently improves the performance of LoRA across three base models and 12 datasets, surpassing other baseline methods.

**Limitations:** N/A

**Conclusion:** The BeamLoRA method enhances the efficiency and accuracy of fine-tuning large language models, revealing deeper insights into the dynamics of LoRA ranks.

**Abstract:** Due to the demand for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as one of the most effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Nevertheless, while LoRA improves efficiency, there remains room for improvement in accuracy. Herein, we adopt a novel perspective to assess the characteristics of LoRA ranks. The results reveal that different ranks within the LoRA modules not only exhibit varying levels of importance but also evolve dynamically throughout the fine-tuning process, which may limit the performance of LoRA. Based on these findings, we propose BeamLoRA, which conceptualizes each LoRA module as a beam where each rank naturally corresponds to a potential sub-solution, and the fine-tuning process becomes a search for the optimal sub-solution combination. BeamLoRA dynamically eliminates underperforming sub-solutions while expanding the parameter space for promising ones, enhancing performance with a fixed rank. Extensive experiments across three base models and 12 datasets spanning math reasoning, code generation, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that BeamLoRA consistently enhances the performance of LoRA, surpassing the other baseline methods.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** chain of thought, faithfulness, language models, machine learning, reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method to measure the faithfulness of chain of thought reasoning in language models by erasing information from their parameters and observing changes in predictions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate if the reasoning provided by language models in chain of thought (CoT) prompts is aligned with their internal beliefs.

**Method:** A framework is introduced to measure parametric faithfulness of CoTs, specifically using an approach called Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), which involves erasing information and observing changes in predictions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the FUR framework for evaluating CoT faithfulness
	2. Demonstration of FUR's effectiveness across multiple language models and datasets
	3. Insights into the impact of reasoning unlearning on model predictions

**Result:** Experiments with four language models and five multi-hop multiple-choice question answering datasets show that FUR can effectively change model predictions by unlearning certain reasoning steps, indicating a correlation between CoT and model faithfulness.

**Limitations:** The framework may require further validation across a broader range of models and tasks to establish generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that CoTs may not always reflect the models' internal beliefs, and alterations in reasoning can lead to different answers, indicating complexities in model reasoning.

**Abstract:** When prompted to think step-by-step, language models (LMs) produce a chain of thought (CoT), a sequence of reasoning steps that the model supposedly used to produce its prediction. Despite much work on CoT prompting, it is unclear if reasoning verbalized in a CoT is faithful to the models' parametric beliefs. We introduce a framework for measuring parametric faithfulness of generated reasoning, and propose Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), an instance of this framework. FUR erases information contained in reasoning steps from model parameters, and measures faithfulness as the resulting effect on the model's prediction. Our experiments with four LMs and five multi-hop multi-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets show that FUR is frequently able to precisely change the underlying models' prediction for a given instance by unlearning key steps, indicating when a CoT is parametrically faithful. Further analysis shows that CoTs generated by models post-unlearning support different answers, hinting at a deeper effect of unlearning.

**TL;DR:** Obliviate is a method that reduces copyright infringement in language models by suppressing exact reproductions of specified sequences while maintaining model fluency and performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for fine-grained control over language models to prevent copyright infringement due to the reproduction of copyrighted text.

**Method:** Obliviate identifies memorized passages and uses a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to suppress exact token reproduction, while enforcing consistency loss on non-target tokens.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a lightweight method for suppressing verbatim text reproduction in LLMs.
	2. Demonstrated significant reduction in copyright infringement while maintaining accuracy.
	3. Evaluated across multiple popular language models and benchmarks.

**Result:** Obliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude across various models, with minimal impact on overall task performance (at most 1% degradation).

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Obliviate is a practical and effective solution for ensuring copyright compliance in language models without significantly affecting their performance.

**Abstract:** Recent copyright agreements between AI companies and content creators underscore the need for fine-grained control over language models' ability to reproduce copyrighted text. Existing defenses-ranging from aggressive unlearning to simplistic output filters-either sacrifice model utility or inadequately address verbatim leakage. We introduce Obliviate, a lightweight post-training method that surgically suppresses exact reproduction of specified sequences while preserving semantic understanding. Obliviate first identifies memorized passages and then, for each target token, minimally adjusts the model's output distribution via a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to drive down the probability of exact reproduction. Simultaneously, we enforce a consistency loss on non-target tokens to retain the model's fluency and task performance. We evaluate Obliviate on four popular 6-8B-parameter models (LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.1-Instruct, Qwen-2.5, and Yi-1.5) using synthetic memorization benchmarks and organic copyrighted excerpts (e.g., Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and Les Miserables). Across all settings, Obliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude (e.g., from hundreds of words to fewer than 12) while degrading downstream accuracy by at most 1% on HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande. Furthermore, we benchmark Obliviate aganist different unlearning and copyright techniques using the MUSE and CoTaEval benchmarks. These results position Obliviate as a practical, high-fidelity solution for copyright compliance in deployed LLMs.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates metrics for style transfer in LLMs, emphasizing content preservation and introduces a new dataset for better assessment.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective evaluation methods for content preservation in style transfer using Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Method:** A large meta-evaluation of existing metrics for style and attribute transfer was conducted, leading to the creation of a new, challenging test set designed to assess these metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new test set for content preservation evaluation in style transfer.
	2. Demonstration that suitable metrics for content preservation are style-aware.
	3. Proposal of a new style-aware method using small language models for evaluation.

**Result:** The study reveals that common metrics, while showing high correlation with human judgments, do not effectively measure content preservation due to their inability to abstract from style changes.

**Limitations:** Existing metrics are misleading for judging content preservation; the results are limited to the datasets used in the study.

**Conclusion:** The authors propose a style-aware evaluation method and a new test set that provides better alignment with human judgments for content preservation metrics in style transfer.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) make it easy to rewrite a text in any style -- e.g. to make it more polite, persuasive, or more positive -- but evaluation thereof is not straightforward. A challenge lies in measuring content preservation: that content not attributable to style change is retained. This paper presents a large meta-evaluation of metrics for evaluating style and attribute transfer, focusing on content preservation. We find that meta-evaluation studies on existing datasets lead to misleading conclusions about the suitability of metrics for content preservation. Widely used metrics show a high correlation with human judgments despite being deemed unsuitable for the task -- because they do not abstract from style changes when evaluating content preservation. We show that the overly high correlations with human judgment stem from the nature of the test data. To address this issue, we introduce a new, challenging test set specifically designed for evaluating content preservation metrics for style transfer. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that suitable metrics for content preservation for style transfer indeed are style-aware. To support efficient evaluation, we propose a new style-aware method that utilises small language models, obtaining a higher alignment with human judgements than prompting a model of a similar size as an autorater.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of verifying claims that have already been fact-checked in different languages, thereby reducing duplicated efforts by human fact-checkers in the face of false information.

**Method:** The study evaluates seven large language models across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings to assess their effectiveness in detecting previously fact-checked claims.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for multilingual fact-checking detection
	2. In-depth analysis across 20 languages
	3. Findings highlight benefits of translation for low-resource languages

**Result:** The results indicate strong performance for LLMs on high-resource languages, but a significant struggle with low-resource languages. Translating texts into English was found to be beneficial for detection in low-resource scenarios.

**Limitations:** The performance of LLMs is notably weaker in low-resource languages, indicating a need for further advancements in this area.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that LLMs hold potential for improving multilingual fact-checking processes and provide a basis for further research in this area.

**Abstract:** In our era of widespread false information, human fact-checkers often face the challenge of duplicating efforts when verifying claims that may have already been addressed in other countries or languages. As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.

**Motivation:** Current training-time safety alignment techniques for LLMs are inadequate against jailbreak attacks, and existing methods like direct preference optimization (DPO) show limitations.

**Method:** The authors use gradient-based analysis to propose an improved safety alignment that separates DPO objectives into robust refusal training and targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of robust refusal training for LLMs
	2. Proposed targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge
	3. Token-level weighting mechanism to enhance refusal learning

**Result:** The proposed method significantly enhances LLM robustness against various jailbreak attacks, including prefilling and multi-turn attacks, in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution contexts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate a correlation between robustness to jailbreak attacks and shifts in token distributions during training, providing insights for future research in LLM safety alignment.

**Abstract:** Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a pressing need to evaluate social bias in LLMs, especially in long-form text generation, as current methods are inadequate.

**Method:** The authors created the Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG) that evaluates LLM outputs based on story prompt continuations in both English and Korean, measuring the instances of neutral versus biased content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG) tailored for story prompts.
	2. Cross-linguistic evaluation of bias in English and Korean.
	3. Comparison of results from long-form and multiple-choice evaluation methods demonstrating their inconsistencies.

**Result:** The study reveals varying probabilities of neutral and biased generations across ten different LLMs and highlights inconsistencies between the long-form generation evaluations and the multiple-choice evaluations from the existing BBQ framework.

**Limitations:** The benchmark is still in the early stages and may require further refinement and validation across different contexts.

**Conclusion:** BBG provides a new framework for assessing bias in long-form generations that could inform better understanding and mitigation of social biases in AI-generated content.

**Abstract:** Measuring social bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, but existing bias evaluation methods struggle to assess bias in long-form generation. We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how LLMs manage positional relevance and its computational processing, which has been largely overlooked in current research.

**Method:** The authors analyze the behavior of attention logits in LLMs and establish a connection between positional relevance and semantic importance through a linear correlation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates positional relevance in LLMs
	2. Establishes a correlation between attention logits and semantic importance
	3. Proposes a theoretical framework for understanding LLMs' tolerance to position perturbations

**Result:** They find a 0.959 linear correlation between attention logits and a combination of positional relevance and semantic importance, indicating a learned behavior rather than a consequence of architecture design.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study provides a framework for explaining the position generalization seen in LLMs, demonstrating it relates to internal mechanisms rather than just architectural features.

**Abstract:** Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.

**Motivation:** Existing approaches to zero-shot tool usage rely on manual rewriting or labeled data validation, which are not feasible in true zero-shot scenarios.

**Method:** PLAY2PROMPT systematically 'plays' with each tool through an iterative trial-and-error process to explore input-output behaviors, refine documentation, and generate usage examples without requiring labeled data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Automated exploration of tool behaviors without labeled data
	2. Refinement of tool documentation through iterative play
	3. Generated usage examples that enhance LLM inference and validation

**Result:** The framework significantly enhances zero-shot tool performance across various tasks and model types, demonstrating its effectiveness in domain-specific tool integration.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PLAY2PROMPT provides a scalable solution for improving the performance of LLMs when integrated with tools in a zero-shot context.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To create consistent phonemic representations from orthographic datasets and to provide a phonemic dataset that addresses gaps in multilingual and spontaneous child-directed speech research.

**Method:** G2P+ leverages established phonemic inventories from the Phoible database to improve on prior grapheme-to-phoneme conversion tools, while IPA CHILDES is created by augmenting the existing CHILDES dataset with phonemic transcriptions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of G2P+ for accurate grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.
	2. Creation of IPA CHILDES, a multilingual phonemic dataset for child-directed speech.
	3. Demonstration of the efficacy of phonemic distributions in learning linguistic features across languages.

**Result:** The utility of IPA CHILDES is demonstrated by training phoneme language models on 11 languages, revealing that the phonemic distributions can effectively learn major class and place features across languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** IPA CHILDES represents a significant advance in phonological research, addressing limitations in existing phonemic datasets and providing valuable resources for linguistics and child language studies.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce two resources: (i) G2P+, a tool for converting orthographic datasets to a consistent phonemic representation; and (ii) IPA CHILDES, a phonemic dataset of child-centered speech across 31 languages. Prior tools for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion result in phonemic vocabularies that are inconsistent with established phonemic inventories, an issue which G2P+ addresses by leveraging the inventories in the Phoible database. Using this tool, we augment CHILDES with phonemic transcriptions to produce IPA CHILDES. This new resource fills several gaps in existing phonemic datasets, which often lack multilingual coverage, spontaneous speech, and a focus on child-directed language. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for phonological research by training phoneme language models on 11 languages and probing them for distinctive features, finding that the distributional properties of phonemes are sufficient to learn major class and place features cross-lingually.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to address the limitations in phonological analysis using large language models (LLMs) and explore the representation of phonemes, as well as to advance methods for training subword tokenizers.

**Method:** The paper introduces unsupervised methods to extract word boundaries based on prediction-error peaks from a trained model, and employs linear probes to investigate the implicit tracking of word boundaries by language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of word segmentation as a phonological probing task.
	2. Unsupervised methods for word boundary extraction from LLMs.
	3. Cross-lingual validation of statistical learning theories related to language acquisition.

**Result:** The findings indicate that phoneme-based language models effectively learn to track word boundaries without explicit training on them and support statistical learning theories of acquisition.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work not only enhances understanding of phonological analysis in LLMs but also motivates novel approaches for the training of subword tokenizers, particularly in multilingual contexts.

**Abstract:** Language models provide a key framework for studying linguistic theories based on prediction, but phonological analysis using large language models (LLMs) is difficult; there are few phonological benchmarks beyond English and the standard input representation used in LLMs (subwords of graphemes) is not suitable for analyzing the representation of phonemes. In this work, we demonstrate how word segmentation can be used as a phonological probing task, allowing us to study the representations learned by phoneme-based language models trained on child-directed speech across 31 languages. Following computational models of word segmentation, we present unsupervised methods for extracting word boundaries from a trained model using the observation that prediction-error peaks at the start of words. We also use linear probes to identify that these models implicitly track word boundaries, even when they do not appear in training. This cross-lingual work corroborates statistical learning theories of acquisition and empirically motivates new methods for training subword tokenizers.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on a limited set of transformation types for prompt perturbations.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the fragility of current LLM reasoning systems and advocate for improved robust reasoning approaches.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

**Motivation:** Fairness in multi-document summarization is essential for providing balanced perspectives from diverse sources, impacting decision-making significantly.

**Method:** FairPO employs preference tuning to enhance both summary-level and corpus-level fairness by generating perturbation-based preference pairs and dynamically adjusting their weights for summaries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FairPO for fairness in MDS
	2. Simultaneous consideration of summary-level and corpus-level fairness
	3. Novel perturbation strategy for generating preference pairs

**Result:** FairPO demonstrates superior performance compared to strong existing methods while maintaining the quality of the generated summaries.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method improves fairness in summarization, enabling a more equitable representation of diverse viewpoints across documents.

**Abstract:** Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values, which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairnes.

### [107] [Towards Large Language Models with Self-Consistent Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07523)

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Interpretability, Feature Importance, Post-hoc Explanations, Direct Preference Optimization

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses the challenges of interpreting large language models (LLMs) by presenting the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB), a benchmark that pairs LLM-generated explanations with feature importance scores, highlighting issues with current explanation metrics and offering a new metric for improved alignment.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the limitations of existing post-hoc explanation methods for LLMs, particularly the inconsistency in feature importance, and to provide a scalable solution for trustworthy model interpretability.

**Method:** Introduced the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) as a benchmark containing diverse tasks and models, each with LLM-generated explanations and feature importance scores, analyzed explanation metrics, and developed an alternative metric to fine-tune LLMs through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) benchmark.
	2. Development of a new metric for evaluating explanation quality in LLMs.
	3. Method to fine-tune LLMs through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for better explanation alignment.

**Result:** The analysis showed that self-consistency scores do not effectively differentiate between correct and incorrect predictions, and that the proposed alternative metric improved the alignment of explanations with decision-relevant features, even when models faced domain shifts.

**Limitations:** The proposed solutions still require extensive evaluation across more diverse datasets to ensure generalizability and robustness.

**Conclusion:** The newly proposed metric provides a pathway toward more reliable and consistent explanations from LLMs, contributing to enhanced model trustworthiness and interpretability.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability: just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.
