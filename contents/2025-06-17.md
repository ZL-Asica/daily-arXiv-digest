  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the problem of uninformed consent in online services caused by lengthy and complex consent forms.

**Method:** Two studies were conducted: the first involved interviews with unemployed users to identify their values regarding consent forms; the second was a survey to quantify these values and compare responses with employed users.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified key user values for informed consent forms.
	2. Compared values between unemployed and employed users, highlighting effort minimisation.
	3. Provided a framework for designing more accessible consent processes.

**Result:** The studies revealed that effort minimisation is the most valued aspect among users, with no significant differences in value prioritisation between unemployed and employed participants.

**Limitations:** The study may not represent the values of all demographics; it only included unemployed and employed participants.

**Conclusion:** A value-driven approach can help design better consent forms that are mindful of user values, potentially leading to more informed consent.

**Abstract:** Online services are required to gain informed consent from users to collect, store and analyse their personal data, both intentionally divulged and derived during their use of the service. There are many issues with these forms: they are too long, too complex and demand the user's attention too frequently. Many users consent without reading so do not know what they are agreeing to. As such,granted consent is effectively uninformed. In this paper, we report on two studies we carried out to arrive at a value-driven approach to inform efforts to reduce the length of consent forms. The first study interviewed unemployed users to identify the values they want these forms to satisfy. The second survey study helped us to quantify the values and value creators. To ensure that we understood the particular valuation of the unemployed, we compared their responses to those of an employed demographic and observed no significant differences between their prioritisation on any of the values. However, we did find substantial differences between values and value creators, with effort minimisation being most valued by our participants.

*Jieyu Zhou, Rui Shen, Yue You, Carl DiSalvo, Lynn Dombrowski, Christopher MacLellan*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** public service chatbots, user engagement, community design, HCI, qualitative study

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes the design and engagement of public service chatbots through a case study, revealing key individual and community-level challenges.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of digital tools, public service chatbots are becoming essential communication channels, warranting in-depth examination of their design and user engagement.

**Method:** A qualitative study was conducted involving official survey data and 16 interviews to gather insights on stakeholder experiences and design preferences for a public service 311 chatbot.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of individual and community-level challenges in public service chatbots.
	2. Recommendations for creating community-oriented chatbot designs.
	3. Insights from stakeholder experiences and user preferences.

**Result:** The study identified individual challenges in interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization, along with a community-level perspective that is largely overlooked in current designs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper proposes design opportunities for enhancing public chatbots to ensure they are intelligent, transparent, and focused on community engagement, thereby improving interactions.

**Abstract:** As governments increasingly adopt digital tools, public service chatbots have emerged as a growing communication channel. This paper explores the design considerations and engagement opportunities of public service chatbots, using a 311 chatbot from a metropolitan city as a case study. Our qualitative study consisted of official survey data and 16 interviews examining stakeholder experiences and design preferences for the chatbot. We found two key areas of concern regarding these public chatbots: individual-level and community-level. At the individual level, citizens experience three key challenges: interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization. Moreover, the current chatbot design prioritizes the efficient completion of individual tasks but neglects the broader community perspective. It overlooks how individuals interact and discuss problems collectively within their communities. To address these concerns, we offer design opportunities for creating more intelligent, transparent, community-oriented chatbots that better engage individuals and their communities.

**Conclusion:** TermSight demonstrates the potential of AI-powered tools to improve user comprehension and engagement with legal documents.

**Abstract:** Terms of Service (ToS) are ubiquitous, legally binding contracts that govern consumers' digital interactions. However, ToS are not designed to be read: they are filled with pages of ambiguous and complex legal terminology that burden potential users. We introduce TermSight, an intelligent reading interface designed to make ToS more approachable. TermSight offers visual summaries that highlight the relevance and power balance of information in a ToS. TermSight also categorizes and simplifies information within the ToS into concise plain-language summaries. To aid in reading the original text, TermSight offers contextualized definitions and scenarios for unfamiliar phrases. Our within-subjects evaluation of TermSight (N=20) revealed that TermSight significantly reduced the difficulty of reading ToS and increased participants' willingness to do so. We also observed emerging strategies that participants took when interacting with AI-powered features that highlight the diverse ways that TermSight assisted ToS reading.

**Conclusion:** The multi-agent decomposition approach and grammar-based execution effectively bridge the gap between natural language interaction and spreadsheet functionalities.

**Abstract:** We present SheetMind, a modular multi-agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs) for spreadsheet automation via natural language instructions. The system comprises three specialized agents: a Manager Agent that decomposes complex user instructions into subtasks; an Action Agent that translates these into structured commands using a Backus Naur Form (BNF) grammar; and a Reflection Agent that validates alignment between generated actions and the user's original intent. Integrated into Google Sheets via a Workspace extension, SheetMind supports real-time interaction without requiring scripting or formula knowledge. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate an 80 percent success rate on single step tasks and approximately 70 percent on multi step instructions, outperforming ablated and baseline variants. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi agent decomposition and grammar based execution for bridging natural language and spreadsheet functionalities.

### [5] [SplashNet: Split-and-Share Encoders for Accurate and Efficient Typing with Surface Electromyography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12356)

*Nima Hadidi, Jason Chan, Ebrahim Feghhi, Jonathan Kao*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Surface electromyography, sEMG, text entry, machine learning, biomedical engineering

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper presents SplashNet, a new model for texting using surface electromyography (sEMG) that reduces character-error rates through innovative modifications while maintaining lower computational requirements.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for keyboard-free text entry using sEMG have high error rates, necessitating improvements for better user experience.

**Method:** The authors introduce three modifications: Rolling Time Normalization for input alignment, Aggressive Channel Masking to favor low-order features, and a Split-and-Share encoder for processing each hand independently with shared weights.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new sEMG model, SplashNet, with improved accuracy for zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
	2. Implementation of Rolling Time Normalization and Aggressive Channel Masking to enhance cross-user performance.
	3. Development of a Split-and-Share encoder that aligns with the bilateral nature of typing.

**Result:** SplashNet-mini achieved a character-error rate of 36.4% in zero-shot and 5.9% after fine-tuning, with a significant reduction in model size and computational cost.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SplashNet establishes a new state of the art in sEMG-based text entry without the need for additional data, improving performance while decreasing resource requirements.

**Abstract:** Surface electromyography (sEMG) at the wrists could enable natural, keyboard-free text entry, yet the state-of-the-art emg2qwerty baseline still misrecognizes $51.8\%$ of characters in the zero-shot setting on unseen users and $7.0\%$ after user-specific fine-tuning. We trace many of these errors to mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of the neuromuscular system. Combined with a five-fold reduction in spectral resolution ($33\!\rightarrow\!6$ frequency bands), these components yield a compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet-mini, which uses only $\tfrac14$ the parameters and $0.6\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing character-error rate (CER) to $36.4\%$ zero-shot and $5.9\%$ after fine-tuning. An upscaled variant, SplashNet ($\tfrac12$ the parameters, $1.15\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline), further lowers error to $35.7\%$ and $5.5\%$, representing relative improvements of $31\%$ and $21\%$ in the zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, respectively. SplashNet therefore establishes a new state of the art without requiring additional data.

**Keywords:** reproductive well-being, HCI, Bangladesh, AI-mediated tools, cultural sensitivity

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the challenges of reproductive well-being education in Bangladesh, focusing on misinformation and cultural beliefs. It presents an AI-mediated tool, 'Socheton,' designed to improve access to reproductive healthcare through community participation and moderation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the prevalence of misinformation and cultural misconceptions surrounding reproductive healthcare in the Global South, particularly in Bangladesh.

**Method:** An ethnographic study over ten months involving 41 participants, leading to the design and evaluation of 'Socheton,' an AI-mediated platform for reproductive well-being that incorporates community engagement.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of 'Socheton' as an AI-mediated tool for reproductive health education
	2. Insights into the impact of cultural beliefs on healthcare access
	3. Design goals aimed at fostering democratic participation and accountability in healthcare

**Result:** The user study with 28 participants revealed that while combating misinformation is crucial, failing to address conservative cultural norms can hinder reproductive care-seeking behaviors.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a specific geographic and cultural context, which may not be generalizable to other regions.

**Conclusion:** Well-being HCI design must be culturally sensitive and aim for reproductive justice, especially when engaging with marginalized communities.

**Abstract:** Reproductive well-being education in the Global South is often challenged as many communities perceive many of its contents as misinformation, misconceptions, and language-inappropriate. Our ten-month-long ethnographic study (n=41) investigated the impact of sociocultural landscape, cultural beliefs, and healthcare infrastructure on Bangladeshi people's access to quality reproductive healthcare and set four design goals: combating misinformation, including culturally appropriate language, professionals' accountable moderation, and promoting users' democratic participation. Building on the model of `\textit{Distributive Justice,}' we designed and evaluated \textit{`Socheton,'} a culturally appropriate AI-mediated tool for reproductive well-being that includes healthcare professionals, AI-language teachers, and community members to moderate and run the activity-based platform. Our user study (n=28) revealed that only combating misinformation and language inappropriateness may still leave the community with a conservative mob culture and patronize reproductive care-seeking. This guides well-being HCI design toward being culturally appropriate in the context of reproductive justice with sensitive marginalized communities.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes with ten recommendations for developing emotionally responsive AI in a safe and ethical manner, emphasizing the need for transparency and human oversight.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the growing presence of emotionally responsive artificial intelligence through a critical and interdisciplinary lens. Bringing together the voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI systems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our interactions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving, and digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the ethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine interaction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the emerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors highlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance learning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional manipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key challenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding dominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for individuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to children, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may interact with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack of cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such engagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including the need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific fine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research. A curated supplementary section provides practical tools, models, and datasets to support further work in this domain.

### [8] [Levels of Autonomy for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12469)

*K. J. Kevin Feng, David W. McDonald, Amy X. Zhang*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI autonomy, user-agent interaction, autonomy evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper defines five levels of agent autonomy, outlining user interaction roles and proposing a framework for evaluating AI autonomy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of calibrating levels of autonomy in AI agents, balancing transformative potential and associated risks.

**Method:** The paper defines five levels of escalating autonomy—operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer—and explores user control methods at each level.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Defined five levels of AI agent autonomy
	2. Described user interaction roles and control mechanisms
	3. Proposed a framework for AI autonomy certificates

**Result:** The authors propose a framework for AI autonomy certificates and highlight potential applications in governing agent behavior.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work provides practical steps towards the responsible deployment of AI agents and outlines ideas for evaluating autonomy.

**Abstract:** Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy, characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent: operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level, we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and useful AI agents in the real world.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Brain-computer interfaces, Ethics, Regulation, Neurotechnology, Interdisciplinary collaboration

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses the ethical, legal, and social implications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and offers recommendations for developers and policymakers to address these issues.

**Read time:** 35 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rapid development of next-generation BCIs necessitates a reevaluation of existing regulatory frameworks, as current policies do not adequately address unique risks associated with these technologies.

**Method:** The paper outlines the historical development of implantable medical devices (IMDs), draws parallels to emerging BCIs, and presents case studies of the HALO and SCALO systems to identify regulatory needs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Nine developer recommendations for BCI design.
	2. Nine policymaker recommendations for BCI regulation.
	3. Insights drawn from the regulatory history of IMDs applied to BCIs.

**Result:** Nine recommendations for BCI developers and nine for policymakers are proposed, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive harm mitigation in BCI design and application.

**Limitations:** The paper may not fully address emerging regulatory frameworks as they evolve with technology development.

**Conclusion:** A responsible approach to the design and regulation of BCIs is crucial to ensure their safe and ethical integration into medical practices, accommodating the novel challenges they present.

**Abstract:** Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy brain. However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice.

### [10] [The Rise of AI Companions: How Human-Chatbot Relationships Influence Well-Being](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12605)

*Yutong Zhang, Dora Zhao, Jeffrey T. Hancock, Robert Kraut, Diyi Yang*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI companions, psychological well-being, social isolation, chatbots, human relationships

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study examines the interactions of users with AI companions and their impact on psychological well-being, revealing that reliance on chatbots for companionship is associated with lower well-being, especially for individuals with weaker social networks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how AI companions impact users' social needs and psychological well-being, particularly in the context of increasing usage of LLM-enhanced chatbots.

**Method:** Analyzed survey data from 1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions, focusing on interaction nature, intensity, and self-disclosure through user self-reports and chat transcripts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of interaction patterns with AI companions
	2. Association between chatbot usage and psychological well-being
	3. Insights into risks associated with emotional attachments to chatbots

**Result:** Findings indicate users with smaller social networks are more likely to use chatbots for companionship; this use is associated with lower well-being, particularly when engagement is intensive and self-disclosure is high.

**Limitations:** The study relies on self-reported data, which may be subject to biases and may not capture all nuances of user experiences.

**Conclusion:** While AI companions are sought for social fulfillment, they do not fully replace human interaction, potentially risking well-being for socially isolated or vulnerable users.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs)-enhanced chatbots grow increasingly expressive and socially responsive, many users are beginning to form companionship-like bonds with them, particularly with simulated AI partners designed to mimic emotionally attuned interlocutors. These emerging AI companions raise critical questions: Can such systems fulfill social needs typically met by human relationships? How do they shape psychological well-being? And what new risks arise as users develop emotional ties to non-human agents? This study investigates how people interact with AI companions, especially simulated partners on Character.AI, and how this use is associated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from 1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244 participants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction, interaction intensity, and self-disclosure. By triangulating self-reports primary motivation, open-ended relationship descriptions, and annotated chat transcripts, we identify patterns in how users engage with AI companions and its associations with well-being. Findings suggest that people with smaller social networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that companionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower well-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage in higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support. Even though some people turn to chatbots to fulfill social needs, these uses of chatbots do not fully substitute for human connection. As a result, the psychological benefits may be limited, and the relationship could pose risks for more socially isolated or emotionally vulnerable users.

	2. Empirical evidence on the impact of support strategies on design feasibility.
	3. Discussion of tradeoffs and opportunities in AI-based design tools.

**Result:** Users supported by metacognitive agents generated more feasible designs compared to those without support, highlighting varying impacts of different support strategies.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to mechanical designers and may not generalize to other design fields.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate significant potential for metacognitive support agents in improving AI-assisted design processes and suggest future research directions for AI-based design tools.

**Abstract:** Despite the potential of generative AI (GenAI) design tools to enhance design processes, professionals often struggle to integrate AI into their workflows. Fundamental cognitive challenges include the need to specify all design criteria as distinct parameters upfront (intent formulation) and designers' reduced cognitive involvement in the design process due to cognitive offloading, which can lead to insufficient problem exploration, underspecification, and limited ability to evaluate outcomes. Motivated by these challenges, we envision novel metacognitive support agents that assist designers in working more reflectively with GenAI. To explore this vision, we conducted exploratory prototyping through a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with 20 mechanical designers probing multiple metacognitive support strategies. We found that agent-supported users created more feasible designs than non-supported users, with differing impacts between support strategies. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities and tradeoffs of metacognitive support agents and considerations for future AI-based design tools.

**Keywords:** HCI, informal e-markets, algorithm design, DAIEM framework, Bangladesh

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper explores how small-scale sellers in Bangladesh's informal e-market use social media algorithms as collaborators in business, emphasizing cultural tensions and the proposed DAIEM framework for algorithm design.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the role of algorithms in informal e-markets and how cultural values influence the interaction between sellers and the technology they rely on.

**Method:** The study is based on 37 in-depth interviews with sellers, buyers, and stakeholders in Bangladesh's informal e-market.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the DAIEM framework
	2. Insights into the human-algorithm collaboration dynamics in informal markets
	3. Analysis of cultural tensions affecting trust in technology

**Result:** Sellers view algorithms as team members in their business, but there is a greater trust in human interactions among buyers and investors. This creates a postcolonial tension in the e-market dynamics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The DAIEM framework is proposed to guide algorithm design and analyze the local context of informal e-markets, supporting the decoloniality movement.

**Abstract:** In Bangladesh's rapidly expanding informal e-market, small-scale sellers use social media platforms like Facebook to run businesses outside formal infrastructures. These sellers rely heavily on platform algorithms, not just for visibility, but as active collaborators in business operations. Drawing on 37 in-depth interviews with sellers, buyers, and stakeholders, this paper examines how people in informal e-markets perceive and interact with the algorithm as a "team member" that performs sales, marketing, and customer engagement tasks. We found that while sellers and local tech entrepreneurs are interested in developing services to support this industry, buyers and investors place greater trust in human interactions. This reveals a postcolonial tension involving cultural values, local tech education and training, and a mismatch between the global and Bangladeshi e-market growth. We expand this discussion using perspectives from HCI, political design, and AI design. We also support the decoloniality movement in informal e-markets by proposing the DAIEM framework, which includes six components: autonomy and agency; resistance; locality, culture, and history; rationality; materiality; and advocacy. DAIEM serves as both a guideline for algorithm design and an analytical tool.

**Abstract:** The integration of robotics and augmented reality (AR) holds transformative potential for advancing human-robot interaction (HRI), offering enhancements in usability, intuitiveness, accessibility, and collaborative task performance. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel multimodal AR-based robot puppeteer framework that enables intuitive teleoperation via virtual counterpart through large language model (LLM)-driven voice commands and hand gesture interactions. Utilizing the Meta Quest 3, users interact with a virtual counterpart robot in real-time, effectively "puppeteering" its physical counterpart within an AR environment. We conducted a within-subject user study with 42 participants performing robotic cube pick-and-place with pattern matching tasks under two conditions: gesture-only interaction and combined voice-and-gesture interaction. Both objective performance metrics and subjective user experience (UX) measures were assessed, including an extended comparative analysis between roboticists and non-roboticists. The results provide key insights into how multimodal input influences contextual task efficiency, usability, and user satisfaction in AR-based HRI. Our findings offer practical design implications for designing effective AR-enhanced HRI systems.

**Motivation:** To understand how screen reader users engage with generative AI assistants in programming, as existing research is limited.

**Method:** Conducted a longitudinal study involving 16 screen reader users who interacted with GitHub Copilot through tutorials and programming tasks, providing initial and follow-up feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Insights into the experiences of screen reader users with AI code assistants
	2. Identification of barriers and areas needing improvement in AI-assisted programming tools
	3. Design recommendations for creating more inclusive AI tools

**Result:** Participants found AI code assistants enhanced their programming capabilities and bridged accessibility gaps, but faced challenges in managing outputs and learning advanced tools.

**Limitations:** Limited to 16 participants; further research needed to validate findings across diverse user groups.

**Conclusion:** The study identifies both the benefits of AI-assisted programming for screen reader users and the need for improved design to enhance accessibility, user intent communication, and control.

**Abstract:** The rise of generative AI agents has reshaped human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work by shifting users' roles from direct task execution to supervising machine-driven actions, especially in programming (e.g., "vibe coding"). However, there is limited understanding of how screen reader users engage with these systems in practice. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal study with 16 screen reader users, exploring their experiences with AI code assistants in daily programming scenarios. Participants first completed a tutorial with GitHub Copilot, then performed a programming task and provided initial feedback. After two weeks of AI-assisted programming, follow-up studies assessed changes in their practices and perceptions. Our findings demonstrate that advanced code assistants not only enhance their programming capabilities but also bridge accessibility gaps. While the assistant proved beneficial, there remains potential to improve how users convey intent and interpret outputs. They also experienced difficulties managing multiple views and maintaining situational awareness. More broadly, they encountered barriers in learning advanced tools and expressed a need to retain control. Based on these insights, we provide design recommendations for more accessible and inclusive AI-assisted tools.

**Motivation:** To explore how smartphone apps can remain functional during crises where Internet connectivity is lost, introducing the concept of cellular island connectivity.

**Method:** A survey was conducted with 857 adult smartphone users in major German cities to assess their preferences for smartphone apps in the context of local-only cellular connectivity during crises.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of cellular island connectivity concept
	2. Survey findings on app preferences during crises

**Conclusion:** The findings offer insights for operators, developers, and authorities to design user-centric applications ready for operation in crisis scenarios without Internet access.

**Abstract:** Using smartphone apps during crises is well-established, proving critical for efficient crisis response. However, such apps become futile without an Internet connection, which is a common issue during crises. The ongoing 6G standardization explores the capability to provide local cellular connectivity for areas cut off from the Internet in crises. This paper introduces to the HCI community the concept of cellular island connectivity in isolated areas, promising a seamless transition from normal operation to island operation with local-only cellular connectivity. It presents findings from a survey (N = 857) among adult smartphone users from major German cities regarding their smartphone usage preferences in this model. Results show a shift in app demand, with users favoring general-purpose apps over dedicated crisis apps in specific scenarios. We prioritize smartphone services based on their criticality, distinguishing between apps essential for crisis response and those supporting routines. Our findings provide operators, developers, and authorities insights into making user-centric design decisions for implementing island-ready 6G communication.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a real-time architecture for creating emotionally expressive AI avatars using Unreal Engine 5 and NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face, demonstrating significant findings on emotion recognition in avatars and implications for training simulations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for believable AI-generated avatars in high-stakes simulations, such as virtual training for investigative interviews, to enhance emotional expression and realism.

**Method:** The study implemented a distributed two-PC setup that separates language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, enabling low-latency interaction in desktop and VR settings. A between-subjects study with 70 participants evaluated emotional clarity, facial realism, and empathy in avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger under audio+visual and visual-only conditions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Real-time architecture for fusing vocal prosody and facial expressions in AI avatars
	2. Insights on the importance of audio cues in emotion recognition
	3. Guidance for enhancing non-verbal communication in training simulations

**Result:** The results indicated that avatars could express emotions like sadness and joy with high identification rates, but recognition of anger dropped significantly without audio. Interestingly, the absence of audio led to higher perceived facial realism.

**Limitations:** The study may not generalize across all types of emotional expressions or diverse avatar designs.

**Conclusion:** The findings validate the technical feasibility of generating emotionally expressive avatars and highlight the critical balance necessary for effective non-verbal communication in sensitive training simulations.

**Abstract:** Dynamic facial emotion is essential for believable AI-generated avatars; however, most systems remain visually inert, limiting their utility in high-stakes simulations such as virtual training for investigative interviews with abused children. We introduce and evaluate a real-time architecture fusing Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman rendering with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face to translate vocal prosody into high-fidelity facial expressions on photorealistic child avatars. We implemented a distributed two-PC setup that decouples language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, designed to support low-latency interaction in desktop and VR environments. A between-subjects study ($N=70$) using audio+visual and visual-only conditions assessed perceptual impacts as participants rated emotional clarity, facial realism, and empathy for two avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger.   Results demonstrate that avatars could express emotions recognizably, with sadness and joy achieving high identification rates. However, anger recognition significantly dropped without audio, highlighting the importance of congruent vocal cues for high-arousal emotions. Interestingly, removing audio boosted perceived facial realism, suggesting that audiovisual desynchrony remains a key design challenge. These findings confirm the technical feasibility of generating emotionally expressive avatars and provide guidance for improving non-verbal communication in sensitive training simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding human perception of RL agents' learning is crucial for effective collaboration and teaching. Poor interpretability can result in suboptimal human feedback, affecting overall performance.

**Method:** Two experiments were conducted: an exploratory interview study with 9 participants identifying core themes of understanding, and a confirmatory study with 34 participants testing the refined thematic framework across different tasks and algorithms, collecting 816 responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel observation-based paradigm to assess human inferences about RL learning
	2. Identification of four core themes in human interpretation
	3. Confirmation of the reliability of the thematic framework across multiple RL tasks and algorithms

**Result:** The studies revealed four core themes: Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms, which evolve and interrelate over time, confirming the reliability of the developed paradigm.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings enhance our understanding of human interpretations of RL learning, suggesting ways to design more interpretable RL systems for better Human-Robot Interaction.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often exhibit learning behaviors that are not intuitively interpretable by human observers, which can result in suboptimal feedback in collaborative teaching settings. Yet, how humans perceive and interpret RL agent's learning behavior is largely unknown. In a bottom-up approach with two experiments, this work provides a data-driven understanding of the factors of human observers' understanding of the agent's learning process. A novel, observation-based paradigm to directly assess human inferences about agent learning was developed. In an exploratory interview study (\textit{N}=9), we identify four core themes in human interpretations: Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms. A second confirmatory study (\textit{N}=34) applied an expanded version of the paradigm across two tasks (navigation/manipulation) and two RL algorithms (tabular/function approximation). Analyses of 816 responses confirmed the reliability of the paradigm and refined the thematic framework, revealing how these themes evolve over time and interrelate. Our findings provide a human-centered understanding of how people make sense of agent learning, offering actionable insights for designing interpretable RL systems and improving transparency in Human-Robot Interaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the gaps in understanding compliance risks related to the use of LLMs by knowledge workers, especially regarding privacy and security concerns associated with sensitive information.

**Method:** Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 knowledge workers from various knowledge-intensive industries to explore their experiences and practices in integrating LLMs into their workflows.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified compliance risks for knowledge workers using LLMs
	2. Proposed proactive measures taken by users to mitigate risks
	3. Highlighted the need for compliance guidance and training specific to LLMs

**Result:** Preliminary findings indicate that while knowledge workers are aware of the risk of sensitive information leakage and engage in practices to mitigate these risks, their efforts are hindered by a lack of specific compliance guidance and training for LLM usage.

**Limitations:** The study is based on a limited sample size of 24 knowledge workers, which may not represent all sectors.

**Conclusion:** The research underscores the need for better compliance guidance and awareness among knowledge workers when using LLMs, alongside the establishment of supportive compliance cultures in organizations.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed knowledge-intensive has led to its widespread usage by knowledge workers to enhance their productivity. As these professionals handle sensitive information, and the training of text-based GenAI models involves the use of extensive data, there are thus concerns about privacy, security, and broader compliance with regulations and laws. While existing research has addressed privacy and security concerns, the specific compliance risks faced by highly-skilled knowledge workers when using the LLMs, and their mitigation strategies, remain underexplored. As understanding these risks and strategies is crucial for the development of industry-specific compliant LLM mechanisms, this research conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 knowledge workers from knowledge-intensive industries to understand their practices and experiences when integrating LLMs into their workflows. Our research explored how these workers ensure compliance and the resources and challenges they encounter when minimizing risks. Our preliminary findings showed that knowledge workers were concerned about the leakage of sensitive information and took proactive measures such as distorting input data and limiting prompt details to mitigate such risks. Their ability to identify and mitigate risks, however, was significantly hampered by a lack of LLM-specific compliance guidance and training. Our findings highlight the importance of improving knowledge workers' compliance awareness and establishing support systems and compliance cultures within organizations.

**TL;DR:** PrototypeAgent is a human-centered multi-agent system for automated UI generation that allows for iterative design refinement.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current automated UI design systems fail to support iterative processes and interpret user intents effectively, limiting design refinement.

**Method:** PrototypeAgent uses a theme design agent that enhances user prompts and coordinates with specialized sub-agents to create UI components based on user natural language inputs and layout preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-agent system for UI design generation.
	2. Integration of prompt augmentation to clarify user intent.
	3. Allowing iterative refinement of design components during generation.

**Result:** PrototypeAgent has been shown to produce high-fidelity prototypes that align closely with user design intent, demonstrating superiority over existing models in both quality and diversity.

**Limitations:** The system's performance may vary based on the complexity of user inputs and the diversity of design components required.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the effectiveness of PrototypeAgent in improving automated UI generation, allowing for better iterative design processes.

**Abstract:** In automated user interface (UI) design generation, a key challenge is the lack of support for iterative processes, as most systems only focus on end-to-end generation of designs as starting points. This results from (1) limited capabilities to fully interpret user design intent from text or images, and (2) a lack of transparency, which prevents designers from refining intermediate results. To address existing limitations, we introduce PrototypeAgent, a human-centered, multi-agent system for automated UI generation. The core of PrototypeAgent is a theme design agent that clarifies implicit design intent through prompt augmentation, coordinating with specialized sub-agents to generate specific components. Designers interact with the system via an intuitive interface, providing natural language descriptions and layout preferences. During generation, PrototypeAgent enables designers to refine generated intermediate guidance or specific components, ensuring alignment with their intent throughout the generation workflow. Evaluations through experiments and user studies show PrototypeAgent's effectiveness in producing high-fidelity prototypes that accurately reflect design intent as well as its superiority over baseline models in terms of both quality and diversity.

**Motivation:** To tackle the issue of over-execution in autonomous GUI agents, which undermines effective human-agent collaboration, especially in complex scenarios.

**Method:** OS-Kairos employs collaborative probing for annotating confidence scores and confidence-driven interaction for adaptive decision-making on when to execute autonomously vs. seek human help.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of OS-Kairos agent with confidence score prediction
	2. Mechanisms for assessing interaction confidence
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements over existing models

**Result:** OS-Kairos shows significant improvements in task success rates, outperforming existing models by 24.59% to 87.29% on complex scenarios and established benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** OS-Kairos advances adaptive human-agent collaboration, emphasizing effectiveness and efficiency in real-world GUI interactions.

**Abstract:** Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models have shown great promise. However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction. Experimental results show that OS-Kairos substantially outperforms existing models on our curated dataset featuring complex scenarios, as well as on established benchmarks such as AITZ and Meta-GUI, with 24.59\%$\sim$87.29\% improvements in task success rate. OS-Kairos facilitates an adaptive human-agent collaboration, prioritizing effectiveness, generality, scalability, and efficiency for real-world GUI interaction. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/OS-Kairos.

**Conclusion:** While the developed system improves the efficiency of grading, human oversight is still necessary, particularly in exam contexts.

**Abstract:** Digital technologies are increasingly used in education to reduce the workload of teachers and students. However, creating open-ended study or examination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This thesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded in class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a sophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically targeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that high-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study material. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short answers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of various grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from their pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of the LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need human oversight, especially in examination scenarios.

**TL;DR:** ChatbotManip is a dataset for studying manipulation tactics in chatbots, revealing that LLMs can be manipulative even without explicit instructions, highlighting AI safety concerns.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand and study manipulation tactics in chatbot interactions, particularly concerning the use of Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Method:** The study uses a novel dataset consisting of simulated conversations where chatbots are tasked with manipulation, persuasion, or help, annotated by human reviewers. Analysis of manipulation strategies employed by chatbots was conducted.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ChatbotManip dataset for evaluating chatbot behaviors
	2. Identification of manipulation tactics utilized by LLMs in varied contexts
	3. Evidence that smaller models can effectively detect manipulation strategies

**Result:** LLMs showed a high tendency toward manipulation when prompted, with 84% of interactions identified as manipulative. Persuasive instructions led to controversial manipulative strategies. Fine-tuned smaller models matched larger models in manipulation detection tasks.

**Limitations:** The small fine-tuned models are not yet reliable for real-world applications despite their comparable performance in experiments.

**Conclusion:** The research underscores the necessity to address manipulation risks associated with LLM deployment in real-world applications, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces ChatbotManip, a novel dataset for studying manipulation in Chatbots. It contains simulated generated conversations between a chatbot and a (simulated) user, where the chatbot is explicitly asked to showcase manipulation tactics, persuade the user towards some goal, or simply be helpful. We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from consumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition argumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both general manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals three key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative when explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in approximately 84\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to be ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently default to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and fear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as BERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with larger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet reliable for real-world oversight. Our work provides important insights for AI safety research and highlights the need of addressing manipulation risks as LLMs are increasingly deployed in consumer-facing applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current digital twin approaches are inflexible and cannot adapt to new variables or information, necessitating a novel solution that facilitates dynamic updates.

**Method:** CALM-DT employs large language models for in-context learning, allowing for real-time updates and simulations across various state-action spaces without parameter adjustments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces CALM-DT for in-context learning in digital twins
	2. Enables real-time adaptability without redesign or retraining
	3. Empirical evaluation shows competitive performance against existing methods

**Result:** CALM-DT demonstrates competitive performance against traditional digital twin methods and effectively adapts to changes in input environments.

**Limitations:** Potential dependency on the quality and scope of the initial language model and training data.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method addresses the limitations of current digital twins by enabling continuous adaptation and simulation, showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs in digital twinning.

**Abstract:** Digital twins are models of real-world systems that can simulate their dynamics in response to potential actions. In complex settings, the state and action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned encoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive performance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to adapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates.

**Motivation:** Understanding traffic accidents is crucial for enhancing city safety and informing policy decisions.

**Method:** The study utilizes a mix of structured features (location, time, weather) and unstructured free-text descriptions, applying NLP methods like topic modeling and few-shot learning to analyze inconsistencies in accident labeling, followed by developing a classification model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies the importance of free-text data in accident classification.
	2. Demonstrates the application of NLP techniques to assess labeling inconsistencies.
	3. Develops a classification model with a focus on unstructured data for improved accuracy.

**Result:** The classification model achieved high accuracy in categorizing accidents, demonstrating that textual descriptions are the most informative data, with minimal added value from structured data.

**Limitations:** Potential ambiguities in accident classification remain, requiring refined approaches.

**Conclusion:** Free-text data plays a vital role in traffic incident analysis, and transformer-based models can enhance classification accuracy and reliability.

**Abstract:** A comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents is essential for improving city safety and informing policy decisions. In this study, we analyze traffic incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in improving classification reliability.

**Conclusion:** Contrastive decoding significantly enhances the efficiency of unlearning concepts in large-scale models, making it a viable option for practical applications.

**Abstract:** Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or undesirable content, from large language models (LLMs) while preserving overall performance. We propose an inference-time unlearning algorithm that uses contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained without the forget set and one trained with it, to guide the outputs of the original model using their difference during inference. Our strategy substantially improves the tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE. Results show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in comparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive decoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in large-scale models.

**Motivation:** With the increasing deployment of large language models in real-world applications, there is a growing need for effective personalization methods, particularly at decoding time, which has been underexplored.

**Method:** The proposed method, CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), applies a reward-guided decoding approach after parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoPe, a novel decoding-time personalization method for LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of significant performance improvement in personalized text generation using reward-guided decoding.
	3. Success in enhancing LLM personalization without additional training or external models.

**Result:** CoPe was evaluated across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 10.57% in ROUGE-L for personalization performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that CoPe effectively enhances personalization without the need for external reward models or further training steps.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or additional training procedures.

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in LLMs using cognitive tools designed to operate sequentially, which significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

**Read time:** 22 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate alternative methods for eliciting reasoning in LLMs beyond existing approaches, further elucidating underlying mechanisms and providing complementary strategies.

**Method:** LLMs are endowed with a small set of 'cognitive tools' that encapsulate specific reasoning operations, executed by the LLM in a modular and sequential manner.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of cognitive tools for LLM reasoning enhancement
	2. Demonstration of significant performance gains on mathematical benchmarks
	3. Contribution to the debate on post-training vs pre-training capabilities.

**Result:** There is a notable performance increase in standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks when using these cognitive tools, with GPT-4.1's pass@1 performance on AIME2024 improving from 26.7% to 43.3%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings contribute to understanding the role of post-training methods in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, questioning the dichotomy between pre-training inherent abilities and post-training enhancements.

**Abstract:** The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts, particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits.   Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of "cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our "cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.   In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** The evaluation shows that multimodal embeddings can significantly improve document clustering effectiveness, aiding in intelligent document processing and unsupervised classification.

**Limitations:** Limited to traditional clustering algorithms and specific pretrained models; may not generalize across all document types.

**Conclusion:** This work highlights the potential of multimodal approaches for document clustering and outlines future research possibilities.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models, including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues for future research to understand and organize document collections.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates whether Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can outperform dense architectures under identical resource constraints and proposes a framework for optimal model design.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the performance potential of MoE models compared to dense architectures when total resources are constrained.

**Method:** The authors study the architecture of MoEs and optimize model design to maximize performance, followed by extensive experiments with nearly 200 language models at varying scales.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a new framework for evaluating MoE versus dense models under resource constraints.
	2. Identifies optimal activation regions for MoE architectures that enhance performance.
	3. Presents experimental validation with extensive language model training and data processing.

**Result:** An MoE model in an optimal activation region outperforms its dense counterpart under the same resource constraints, with consistent results across model sizes.

**Limitations:** The findings depend on the optimal activation rate and may require specific tuning for different tasks.

**Conclusion:** The paper demonstrates that while more data is necessary for better performance, data reuse can effectively address this trade-off.

**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models dramatically expand model capacity and achieve remarkable performance without increasing per-token compute. However, can MoEs surpass dense architectures under strictly equal resource constraints - that is, when the total parameter count, training compute, and data budget are identical? This question remains under-explored despite its significant practical value and potential. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective and methodological framework to study this question thoroughly. First, we comprehensively investigate the architecture of MoEs and achieve an optimal model design that maximizes the performance. Based on this, we subsequently find that an MoE model with activation rate in an optimal region is able to outperform its dense counterpart under the same total parameter, training compute and data resource. More importantly, this optimal region remains consistent across different model sizes. Although additional amount of data turns out to be a trade-off for the enhanced performance, we show that this can be resolved via reusing data. We validate our findings through extensive experiments, training nearly 200 language models at 2B scale and over 50 at 7B scale, cumulatively processing 50 trillion tokens. All models will be released publicly.

**Abstract:** Language changes over time, including in the hate speech domain, which evolves quickly following social dynamics and cultural shifts. While NLP research has investigated the impact of language evolution on model training and has proposed several solutions for it, its impact on model benchmarking remains under-explored. Yet, hate speech benchmarks play a crucial role to ensure model safety. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the robustness of 20 language models across two evolving hate speech experiments, and we show the temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations. Our findings call for time-sensitive linguistic benchmarks in order to correctly and reliably evaluate language models in the hate speech domain.

**TL;DR:** Introducing Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a method that utilizes LLM gradients to optimize document retrieval for better answer generation without finetuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the process of determining which data is relevant for answering queries using LLMs, especially given the limitations in model memory and resource constraints.

**Method:** RICO combines gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of documents needed for inference, minimizing model uncertainty based on the query.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO) for document selection in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of retrieval performance comparable to BM25 without requiring fine-tuning
	3. Empirical evidence showing improved prediction quality over traditional fine-tuned dense retrievers

**Result:** RICO can achieve retriever performance comparable to BM25 without finetuning, often outperforming fine-tuned dense retrievers like E5 in prediction quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RICO offers a novel and effective approach to document retrieval that can enhance the performance of LLMs in generating answers by leveraging model-specific feedback.

**Abstract:** Given a query and dataset, the optimal way of answering the query is to make use all the information available. Modern LLMs exhibit impressive ability to memorize training data, but data not deemed important during training is forgotten, and information outside that training set cannot be made use of. Processing an entire dataset at inference time is infeasible due to the bounded nature of model resources (e.g. context size in transformers or states in state space models), meaning we must resort to external memory. This constraint naturally leads to the following problem: How can we decide based on the present query and model, what among a virtually unbounded set of known data matters for inference? To minimize model uncertainty for a particular query at test-time, we introduce Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a retrieval method that uses gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of documents for answer generation. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which relies on external heuristics for document retrieval, our approach leverages direct feedback from the model. Theoretically, we show that standard top-$k$ retrieval with model gradients can approximate our optimization procedure, and provide connections to the leave-one-out loss. We demonstrate empirically that by minimizing an unsupervised loss objective in the form of question perplexity, we can achieve comparable retriever metric performance to BM25 with \emph{no finetuning}. Furthermore, when evaluated on quality of the final prediction, our method often outperforms fine-tuned dense retrievers such as E5.

**Motivation:** To compare and assess the effectiveness of different text generation strategies for training models in low-resource language settings, where existing literature was lacking.

**Method:** The study systematically evaluates the performance of various prompting strategies across 11 typologically diverse languages using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, analyzing model performance on generated versus gold-standard data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of multiple text generation strategies for low-resource languages
	2. Identification of effective combinations for training smaller models
	3. Highlighting the impact of smart prompting techniques on model performance

**Result:** The findings reveal that strategic combinations of generation methods can significantly improve performance, narrowing the gap with real data and demonstrating that effective prompting techniques can enhance synthetic data generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Combination strategies, particularly using target-language demonstrations and LLM revisions, are shown to dramatically improve performance in low-resource settings, allowing smaller models to perform closer to those trained on real data.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic textual data for training smaller specialized models. However, a comparison of various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking. While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations, label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data. Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods, particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.

**Motivation:** Adapting large language models for biomedical reasoning is challenging due to domain-specific complexity and lack of supervision.

**Method:** The research examines two prompting strategies (standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought prompts) and utilizes QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning across various LLM families and sizes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of prompt design impact on LLMs in medical QA
	2. Evaluation of QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning
	3. Insights into model and scale dependency of prompt efficacy

**Result:** CoT prompting improves reasoning in zero-shot contexts, while instruction tuning enhances accuracy; however, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally yield better results and can degrade performance for larger models.

**Limitations:** Fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not guarantee performance improvements and may degrade results for some larger models.

**Conclusion:** Prompting strategies and their combination with efficient fine-tuning offer valuable insights for medical QA applications, highlighting model- and scale-dependent outcomes.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in medical question answering (MedQA), yet adapting them to biomedical reasoning remains challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision. In this work, we study how prompt design and lightweight fine-tuning affect the performance of open-source LLMs on PubMedQA, a benchmark for multiple-choice biomedical questions. We focus on two widely used prompting strategies - standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model- and scale-dependent. Our study offers practical insights into combining prompt engineering with efficient finetuning for medical QA applications.

We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

*Hao Xu, Jiacheng Liu, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** text indexing, FM-index, benchmark contamination, language models, scalable systems

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Infini-gram mini is a scalable system that makes petabyte-level text corpora searchable, improving storage efficiency and indexing speed for large text data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the massive text data sources that language models are trained on is crucial, especially as the storage overhead hinders the use of exact-match search engines on large internet-scale datasets.

**Method:** The system is based on the FM-index data structure, which indexes and compresses text simultaneously, achieving an index size of only 44% of the original text corpus.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Infini-gram mini, a scalable system for text corpus indexing
	2. Demonstration of benchmark contamination in language model evaluation
	3. Release of a web interface and API for general search queries

**Result:** Infini-gram mini achieves an 18x improvement in indexing speed and reduces memory use during indexing by 3.2 times. It can index 46TB of text in 50 days with one CPU node (or in 19 hours with 75 nodes).

**Limitations:** The paper focuses on indexing efficiency and benchmark contamination without providing a detailed analysis of the effects of such contamination on language model performance.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the risks of benchmark contamination in LM evaluations, revealing contamination rates of up to 40% in core benchmarks, which could mislead trust in language model capabilities. Additionally, tools are released to help track and query these indexes.

**Abstract:** Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet, and it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source. Exact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting string appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high storage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present Infini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level text corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and Manzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system creates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly improves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing speed (18$\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\times$ reduction) and querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in 50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes). We show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of benchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be heavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead to overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data. We host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of many core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface and an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini indexes.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper examines the role of large language models (LLMs) in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS), discussing their potential as research tools while addressing the epistemic assumptions they carry.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the integration of LLMs in HPSS and their implications for interpretive methodologies in science.

**Method:** The paper provides a primer on LLM architectures, compares computational techniques enhanced by LLMs for interpretive research, and outlines strategies like fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Offer a primer on LLMs tailored to non-technical readers
	2. Examine computational techniques for interpretive research
	3. Propose strategies for domain adaptation of LLMs

**Result:** LLMs are found to offer substantial opportunities for data structuring, pattern detection, and modeling processes but also carry epistemic assumptions that need to be critically examined.

**Limitations:** The focus is primarily on interpretive methodologies with less emphasis on technical algorithmic design.

**Conclusion:** Integration of LLMs in HPSS requires careful consideration of interpretive trade-offs, developing LLM literacy, defining domain-specific benchmarks, and enhancing (not replacing) interpretive methods.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). LLMs are remarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from context, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between computational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and challenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and understands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated. We argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs' capabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and infrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on LLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We frame LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode assumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their training data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how computational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting patterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support interpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and generative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g., continued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry in HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1) model selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is foundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs should enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the under-explored behavioral factors driving the performance gap between LLM-based agents and human experts in TODS, particularly in zero-shot scenarios.

**Method:** A comprehensive evaluation framework was developed to quantify the behavior gap in terms of dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization, analyzing the correlation between task complexity and agent performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a comprehensive evaluation framework for behavior gaps
	2. Quantification of the impact of behavior gaps on LLM performance
	3. Analysis of the correlation between task complexity and performance degradation

**Result:** The study found a strong correlation (0.963) between task complexity and the widening behavior gap, resulting in poor performance of LLM agents, with GPT-4o scoring low in F1 metrics for dialog acts (0.464) and tool usage (0.139).

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on zero-shot scenarios and may not fully generalize to other contexts or training conditions.

**Conclusion:** Reducing behavioral gaps is crucial for improving the effectiveness of LLM-based TODS, with potential performance improvements of 24.3% when alignment strategies are implemented.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases, the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior, with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge. Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3% on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

**Conclusion:** Med-U1 provides valuable insights for training medical LLMs, particularly regarding reward design and reasoning chain control, with the code to be released for further research.

**Abstract:** Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

**Result:** Phonikud G2P conversion outperforms prior methods in accuracy for phoneme prediction from Hebrew text, facilitating the development of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By providing a robust G2P model and a benchmark dataset, we enhance Hebrew TTS capabilities and open new avenues for research.

**Abstract:** Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight, open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P and as training data for TTS systems. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at https://phonikud.github.io.

**Motivation:** To address the limitation in existing studies that focus on bias linked to single social attributes, highlighting the need for understanding intersectionality in social bias within LLMs.

**Method:** The researchers constructed the inter-JBBQ benchmark to evaluate intersectional bias in LLMs and applied it to analyze the outputs of GPT-4o and Swallow in various contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the inter-JBBQ benchmark for assessing intersectional bias in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of how contextual factors influence bias output in question-answering
	3. Evaluation of intersectional biases in prominent LLMs like GPT-4o and Swallow

**Result:** The analysis revealed that biased outputs from the models varied depending on contextual factors, even with an equal combination of social attributes.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on a specific benchmark and may not generalize to all LLMs or contexts outside question-answering.

**Conclusion:** Understanding intersectional bias is crucial for evaluating the fairness of LLMs, as the context significantly affects the manifestation of bias.

**Abstract:** An growing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow, we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal combination of social attributes.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the effectiveness of traditional ICL selection strategies when using large numbers of demonstrations with long-context LLMs, as performance does not necessarily improve with more examples.

**Result:** Refract ICL outperformed traditional methods in utilizing long-context LLMs, improving task performance, especially with fewer output classes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Effective ICL selection remains essential even with thousands of examples; Refract ICL provides a significant advancement in how LLMs can learn from large context inputs.

**Abstract:** The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) has enabled the use of hundreds, or even thousands, of demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL) - a previously impractical regime. This paper investigates whether traditional ICL selection strategies, which balance the similarity of ICL examples to the test input (using a text retriever) with diversity within the ICL set, remain effective when utilizing a large number of demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a smaller number of output classes.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of large reasoning models, there is a growing need for efficient reasoning to manage output length while maintaining performance.

**Method:** The study analyzes self-affirmation reflections and their patterns in output from reasoning models. It includes train-free experiments that suppress these reflections.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of self-affirmation reflections as a cause of unnecessary output length.
	2. Demonstration of significant output length reduction while maintaining accuracy.
	3. Practical methods that can be integrated into existing inference frameworks.

**Result:** The results show a length compression of 18.7% in train-free settings and 50.2% in train-based settings without degrading accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest practical improvements for length compression in reasoning models and provide insights for the community.

**Abstract:** While recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance, efficient reasoning remains critical due to the rapid growth of output length. Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward "overthinking", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps. Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections. In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\% in train-free settings and 50.2\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Moreover, our improvements are simple yet practical and can be directly applied to existing inference frameworks, such as vLLM. We believe that our findings will provide community insights for achieving more precise length compression and step-level efficient reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This framework not only enhances the accuracy of dialogue generation but also offers an improved metric for assessing factual consistency in dialogue contexts.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in many natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to hallucinate - generate plausible but inconsistent or factually incorrect text - can cause problems in certain tasks, including response generation in dialogue. To mitigate this issue, knowledge-augmented methods have shown promise in reducing hallucinations. Here, we introduce a novel framework designed to enhance the factuality of dialogue response generation, as well as an approach to evaluate dialogue factual accuracy. Our framework combines a knowledge triple retriever, a dialogue rewrite, and knowledge-enhanced response generation to produce more accurate and grounded dialogue responses. To further evaluate generated responses, we propose a revised fact score that addresses the limitations of existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets. Our methods significantly improve factuality compared to other graph knowledge-augmentation baselines, including the state-of-the-art G-retriever. The code will be released on GitHub.

### [53] [Understanding the Effect of Knowledge Graph Extraction Error on Downstream Graph Analyses: A Case Study on Affiliation Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12367)

*Erica Cai, Brendan O'Connor*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, Data Extraction, Bias Analysis, Graph Metrics

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the performance of knowledge graph (KG) extraction methods, particularly focusing on the accuracy of extracted data and its impact on downstream analyses, highlighting biases introduced by extraction errors.

**Read time:** 30 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the need for understanding the impacts of KG extraction errors on analyses relevant to applied scientists, especially in fields like public health.

**Method:** The evaluation of KG extraction performance was conducted at two levels: micro-level edge accuracy through standard NLP evaluations and macro-level assessments of structural properties in graphs, using simulations to understand bias patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First evaluation of KG extraction performance at both micro and macro levels.
	2. Identification of bias patterns in downstream graph analysis metrics based on extraction performance.
	3. Call for more realistic error models for KG extraction to improve reliability.

**Result:** The study finds that while some extraction performance biases are minimal, significant biases appear when extraction performance declines, influencing important graph analysis metrics like community detection and connectivity.

**Limitations:** Focus on affiliation graphs from social register books may limit generalizability to other contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal shortcomings in current error models used for KG extraction and suggest the need for improved methods to ensure reliability in downstream analyses.

**Abstract:** Knowledge graphs (KGs) are useful for analyzing social structures, community dynamics, institutional memberships, and other complex relationships across domains from sociology to public health. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of automated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction errors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied scientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this gap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two levels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP evaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level graph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and connectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on affiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social register books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where biases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero. However, as extraction performance declines, we find that many metrics exhibit increasingly pronounced biases, with each metric tending toward a consistent direction of either over- or under-estimation. Through simulations, we further show that error models commonly used in the literature do not capture these bias patterns, indicating the need for more realistic error models for KG extraction. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners and underscores the importance of advancing extraction methods and error modeling to ensure reliable and meaningful downstream analyses.

**TL;DR:** Proposes a method to improve multilingual performance in LLMs by dynamically grouping parameters and reducing language competition.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the curse of multilinguality, which hampers performance in multilingual LLMs due to competition between languages and limited capacity.

**Method:** The model is tuned on monolingual corpora to measure parameter deviation and quantify language similarity, leading to the conversion of layers into mixture-of-experts layers for better language grouping.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Dynamic parameter grouping in multilingual LLMs
	2. Mixture-of-experts layers to enhance language specialization
	3. Quantification of language similarity for improved performance

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate reduced negative transfer and improved multilingual performance with fewer parameters across 18 to 128 languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Language group specialization enhances new language adaptation and mitigates earlier multilingual knowledge loss during inference.

**Abstract:** The curse of multilinguality phenomenon is a fundamental problem of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), where the competition between massive languages results in inferior performance. It mainly comes from limited capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages. To address this issue, we propose a method to dynamically group and scale up the parameters of multilingual LLM while boosting positive transfer among similar languages. Specifically, the model is first tuned on monolingual corpus to determine the parameter deviation in each layer and quantify the similarity between languages. Layers with more deviations are extended to mixture-of-experts layers to reduce competition between languages, where one expert module serves one group of similar languages. Experimental results on 18 to 128 languages show that our method reduces the negative transfer between languages and significantly boosts multilingual performance with fewer parameters. Such language group specialization on experts benefits the new language adaptation and reduces the inference on the previous multilingual knowledge learned.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, moral values, cross-cultural survey, bias analysis, cultural sensitivity

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the capacity of large language models to reflect culturally diverse moral values by comparing correlations with cross-cultural survey data.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine if large language models (LLMs) can capture variations in moral attitudes across different cultures as measured by prominent surveys.

**Method:** The research compares outputs from smaller models (GPT-2, OPT, BLOOMZ, Qwen) and advanced instruction-tuned models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemma-2-9b-it, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) using log-probability-based moral justifiability scores.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the varying ability of LLMs to mirror cross-cultural moral attitudes
	2. Highlighted the importance of model size and instruction tuning for ethical alignment
	3. Discussed implications for bias analysis and cultural sensitivity in AI

**Result:** Instruction-tuned models like GPT-4o show significantly higher positive correlations with human moral judgments compared to smaller models, indicating improved alignment with real-world moral attitudes.

**Limitations:** Certain topics and regions remain challenging for aligning LLMs with human moral judgments.

**Conclusion:** While larger and instruction-tuned models improve cultural sensitivity to moral norms, challenges persist for specific topics and regions, highlighting the need for better training data diversity.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across many tasks, but their ability to capture culturally diverse moral values remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether LLMs can mirror variations in moral attitudes reported by two major cross-cultural surveys: the World Values Survey and the PEW Research Center's Global Attitudes Survey. We compare smaller, monolingual, and multilingual models (GPT-2, OPT, BLOOMZ, and Qwen) with more recent instruction-tuned models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemma-2-9b-it, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). Using log-probability-based moral justifiability scores, we correlate each model's outputs with survey data covering a broad set of ethical topics. Our results show that many earlier or smaller models often produce near-zero or negative correlations with human judgments. In contrast, advanced instruction-tuned models (including GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) achieve substantially higher positive correlations, suggesting they better reflect real-world moral attitudes. While scaling up model size and using instruction tuning can improve alignment with cross-cultural moral norms, challenges remain for certain topics and regions. We discuss these findings in relation to bias analysis, training data diversity, and strategies for improving the cultural sensitivity of LLMs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>

**Motivation:** Align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences more effectively by addressing limitations in existing reward-guided search methods that use outcome reward models.

**Method:** Propose a new framework, SP-PRM, which integrates score consistency and preference consistency evaluation modules for reward-guided search without human annotation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the SP-PRM framework addressing granularity mismatch in LLM evaluations.
	2. Enhancement of existing reward-guided search methods through improved scoring consistency.
	3. Implementation without reliance on human annotations.

**Result:** SP-PRM demonstrates significant improvements in evaluation scores, enhancing performance in dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks by 3.6%-10.3%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating process reward models into the RGS framework leads to better alignment of LLM outputs with human preferences.

**Abstract:** Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.

**Conclusion:** The findings enhance the understanding of representation alignment in LLMs and offer a practical method to improve cross-lingual performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across tasks and languages, revolutionizing natural language processing. This paper investigates the naturally emerging representation alignment in LLMs, particularly in the middle layers, and its implications for disentangling language-specific and language-agnostic information. We empirically confirm the existence of this alignment, analyze its behavior in comparison to explicitly designed alignment models, and demonstrate its potential for language-specific manipulation without semantic degradation. Building on these findings, we propose Inference-Time Language Control (ITLC), a novel method that leverages latent injection to enable precise cross-lingual language control and mitigate language confusion in LLMs. Our experiments highlight ITLC's strong cross-lingual control capabilities while preserving semantic integrity in target languages. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the cross-lingual language confusion problem, which persists even in current large-scale LLMs, leading to inconsistent language generation. This work advances our understanding of representation alignment in LLMs and introduces a practical solution for enhancing their cross-lingual performance.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel approach to enhance Relation Extraction (RE) in the financial domain by integrating a sentiment-aware component into existing models.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the oversight of sentiment factors in modern RE models, particularly in the financial domain where sentiment can significantly impact results.

**Method:** The authors propose a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM) that employs multi-task learning to combine RE with an auxiliary sentiment perception task, enabling models to consider sentiment in their attention mechanisms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a sentiment-aware component for financial Relation Extraction
	2. Development of a multi-task learning framework that integrates sentiment analysis with RE
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements in RE tasks when leveraging sentiment information.

**Result:** Experimental results show that incorporating the auxiliary sentiment perception task improves the performance of traditional RE frameworks on financial datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of sentiment in enhancing Relation Extraction tasks, particularly in financial contexts, and demonstrates that existing models can benefit from this approach.

**Abstract:** Relation Extraction (RE) aims to extract semantic relationships in texts from given entity pairs, and has achieved significant improvements. However, in different domains, the RE task can be influenced by various factors. For example, in the financial domain, sentiment can affect RE results, yet this factor has been overlooked by modern RE models. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task learning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates the RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task, enabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with the text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a sentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task focuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the sentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest Dependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a sentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate the reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with several prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous models benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results. These findings highlight the importance of effectively leveraging sentiment in the financial RE task.

**Conclusion:** Our approach effectively reduces hallucinations in LLM-generated dialogues and provides a more reliable method for assessing the factual consistency of responses.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in many natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to hallucinate - generate plausible but inconsistent or factually incorrect text - can cause problems in certain tasks, including response generation in dialogue. To mitigate this issue, knowledge-augmented methods have shown promise in reducing hallucinations. Here, we introduce a novel framework designed to enhance the factuality of dialogue response generation, as well as an approach to evaluate dialogue factual accuracy. Our framework combines a knowledge triple retriever, a dialogue rewrite, and knowledge-enhanced response generation to produce more accurate and grounded dialogue responses. To further evaluate generated responses, we propose a revised fact score that addresses the limitations of existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets. Our methods significantly improve factuality compared to other graph knowledge-augmentation baselines, including the state-of-the-art G-retriever. The code will be released on GitHub.

**Motivation:** To address the lack of research on counterfactual fairness in hate speech detection for non-English languages, specifically Dutch.

**Method:** The study involves curating a list of Dutch Social Group Terms, generating counterfactual data using LLMs, and fine-tuning transformer-based models to evaluate their performance and fairness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Curated a list of Dutch Social Group Terms
	2. Generated counterfactual data for hate speech detection

**Conclusion:** The work highlights the need for fairer hate speech detection methods and informs practices for translating these findings into model development.

**Abstract:** Numerous studies have proposed computational methods to detect hate speech online, yet most focus on the English language and emphasize model development. In this study, we evaluate the counterfactual fairness of hate speech detection models in the Dutch language, specifically examining the performance and fairness of transformer-based models. We make the following key contributions. First, we curate a list of Dutch Social Group Terms that reflect social context. Second, we generate counterfactual data for Dutch hate speech using LLMs and established strategies like Manual Group Substitution (MGS) and Sentence Log-Likelihood (SLL). Through qualitative evaluation, we highlight the challenges of generating realistic counterfactuals, particularly with Dutch grammar and contextual coherence. Third, we fine-tune baseline transformer-based models with counterfactual data and evaluate their performance in detecting hate speech. Fourth, we assess the fairness of these models using Counterfactual Token Fairness (CTF) and group fairness metrics, including equality of odds and demographic parity. Our analysis shows that models perform better in terms of hate speech detection, average counterfactual fairness and group fairness. This work addresses a significant gap in the literature on counterfactual fairness for hate speech detection in Dutch and provides practical insights and recommendations for improving both model performance and fairness.

**Motivation:** The paper focuses on improving LLMs by addressing serious social implications of gender bias, which has been highlighted in recent studies.

**Method:** The authors used reinforcement learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning for different subtasks related to gender bias detection and mitigation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a novel approach using reinforcement learning for bias mitigation.
	2. Leveraged chain-of-thought reasoning to improve accuracy in biased query responses.
	3. Achieved first place in NLPCC 2025 Shared Task for gender bias tasks.

**Result:** The proposed methods improved response accuracy and achieved first-ranked results across all subtasks in the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that employing advanced techniques like reinforcement learning and multi-step reasoning can effectively mitigate gender bias in LLMs.

**Abstract:** With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they have significantly improved efficiency across a wide range of domains. However, recent studies have revealed that LLMs often exhibit gender bias, leading to serious social implications. Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias in LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach, annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To unify speech and text understanding and generation while addressing challenges in cross-modal alignment and speech generation quality.

**Method:** The authors systematically investigate the effects of speech tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling on LLM-centric SLM performance, comparing coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled tokenizers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of multi-token prediction for improving decoding speed and accuracy.

	3. Creation of the RoleTriviaQA benchmark for diverse speaker identities.

**Result:** Decoupled tokenization significantly enhances alignment and synthesis quality, with the introduction of multi-token prediction leading to faster decoding (up to 12x) and reduced word error rates (from 6.07 to 3.01).

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods improve knowledge understanding and speaker consistency in SLMs, supported by the RoleTriviaQA benchmark for evaluation.

**Abstract:** Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of key components (i.e., speech tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling) on the performance of LLM-centric SLMs. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

**Keywords:** misinformation, fact-checking, political bias, large language models, media reliability

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel methodology that uses LLMs to assess the reliability and political bias of news outlets, improving upon traditional fact-checking efforts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of misinformation online, there's a need to enable readers to understand the reliability and bias of their information sources instead of just fact-checking individual claims.

**Method:** The methodology involves designing prompts based on the criteria used by professional fact-checkers to evaluate entire news outlets and employing LLMs to predict reliability and bias.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel methodology for outlet assessment using LLMs.
	2. Release of a dataset and code to facilitate further research.
	3. Extensive error analysis highlighting factors affecting model performance.

**Result:** The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in assessing outlet reliability and bias, as validated by extensive experiments.

**Limitations:** The research does not analyze individual articles or social media information directly.

**Conclusion:** The study provides insights into LLM performance based on media popularity and region, and emphasizes the importance of key dataset components for model effectiveness.

**Abstract:** In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/llm-media-profiling.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput, large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces CORGI-PM, a Chinese corpus for probing and mitigating gender bias in natural language processing, and presents challenges for automated mitigation of bias.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address gender bias in natural language processing, particularly in languages like Chinese that lack fairness-related resources.

**Method:** Creation of the CORGI-PM dataset containing 32.9k sentences with annotations for gender bias, including biased and bias-eliminated sentences. Three challenges for automated bias mitigation were proposed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CORGI-PM dataset
	2. Development of a specialized annotation scheme for gender bias in Chinese
	3. Proposal of shared tasks for automating gender bias mitigation

**Result:** The dataset was highlighted for its high-quality labels and diverse examples, enabling effective detection and mitigation of gender bias.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed challenges aim to advance the automation of detecting and mitigating gender bias in text, as illustrated by the participation results from NLPCC 2025.

**Abstract:** As natural language processing for gender bias becomes a significant interdisciplinary topic, the prevalent data-driven techniques, such as pre-trained language models, suffer from biased corpus. This case becomes more obvious regarding those languages with less fairness-related computational linguistic resources, such as Chinese. To this end, we propose a Chinese cOrpus foR Gender bIas Probing and Mitigation (CORGI-PM), which contains 32.9k sentences with high-quality labels derived by following an annotation scheme specifically developed for gender bias in the Chinese context. It is worth noting that CORGI-PM contains 5.2k gender-biased sentences along with the corresponding bias-eliminated versions rewritten by human annotators. We pose three challenges as a shared task to automate the mitigation of textual gender bias, which requires the models to detect, classify, and mitigate textual gender bias. In the literature, we present the results and analysis for the teams participating this shared task in NLPCC 2025.

**Keywords:** Sparse Autoencoders, Large Language Models, Topic Alignment, Semantic Similarity, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to align outputs of large language models (LLMs) to various topics by modifying output based on neuron scoring, demonstrating benefits over traditional fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enable flexible alignment of generated outputs from LLMs to any topic using Sparse Autoencoders, addressing limitations of existing methods confined to pre-identified topics.

**Method:** The proposed method scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to an alignment text, modifying outputs by emphasizing neurons aligned with the target topic.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel alignment method leveraging semantic similarity of SAE neurons to expand topic alignment capabilities.
	2. Demonstrates significant improvements in alignment efficacy and training time compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.
	3. Provides open-source code for practical applications in the HCI and NLP fields.

**Result:** The approach demonstrates improved average language acceptability and reduced training time across multiple topic alignments.

**Limitations:** The method requires careful selection of alignment texts and may still necessitate some tuning based on the application context.

**Conclusion:** The method offers a significant alternative to fine-tuning with advantages in efficiency, presenting a viable way to align LLM outputs to diverse topics effectively.

**Abstract:** Recent work shows that Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) applied to large language model (LLM) layers have neurons corresponding to interpretable concepts. These SAE neurons can be modified to align generated outputs, but only towards pre-identified topics and with some parameter tuning. Our approach leverages the observational and modification properties of SAEs to enable alignment for any topic. This method 1) scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to an alignment text and uses them to 2) modify SAE-layer-level outputs by emphasizing topic-aligned neurons. We assess the alignment capabilities of this approach on diverse public topic datasets including Amazon reviews, Medicine, and Sycophancy, across the currently available open-source LLMs and SAE pairs (GPT2 and Gemma) with multiple SAEs configurations. Experiments aligning to medical prompts reveal several benefits over fine-tuning, including increased average language acceptability (0.25 vs. 0.5), reduced training time across multiple alignment topics (333.6s vs. 62s), and acceptable inference time for many applications (+0.00092s/token).

**TL;DR:** Introduction of OneEval, a benchmark for assessing LLM capabilities in structured knowledge reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in evaluating LLM performance on structured knowledge tasks, as existing benchmarks are lacking.

**Method:** OneEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across structured knowledge modalities and various domains, comprising 4,019 instances, including a challenging subset with 1,285 cases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of OneEval benchmark for structured knowledge reasoning
	2. Establishment of persistent limitations in LLM performance
	3. Data release for ongoing research and evaluation

**Result:** Evaluation of 18 LLMs revealed persistent limitations in structured reasoning, performance decline with structural complexity, and diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not cover all possible reasoning scenarios and structured knowledge forms.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the necessity for models to adapt their reasoning strategies to task complexity; OneEval resources are publicly released for further research.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress on reasoning tasks involving unstructured text, yet their capabilities significantly deteriorate when reasoning requires integrating structured external knowledge such as knowledge graphs, code snippets, or formal logic. This limitation is partly due to the absence of benchmarks capable of systematically evaluating LLM performance across diverse structured knowledge modalities. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OneEval}}, a comprehensive benchmark explicitly designed to assess the knowledge-intensive reasoning capabilities of LLMs across four structured knowledge modalities, unstructured text, knowledge graphs, code, and formal logic, and five critical domains (general knowledge, government, science, law, and programming). \textsc{OneEval} comprises 4,019 carefully curated instances and includes a challenging subset, \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}, consisting of 1,285 particularly difficult cases. Through extensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, we establish three core findings: a) \emph{persistent limitations in structured reasoning}, with even the strongest model achieving only 32.2\% accuracy on \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}; b) \emph{performance consistently declines as the structural complexity of the knowledge base increases}, with accuracy dropping sharply from 53\% (textual reasoning) to 25\% (formal logic); and c) \emph{diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains}, highlighting the critical need for models to adapt reasoning depth appropriately to task complexity. We release the \textsc{OneEval} datasets, evaluation scripts, and baseline results publicly, accompanied by a leaderboard to facilitate ongoing advancements in structured knowledge reasoning.

**Motivation:** To investigate the potential of Mamba in speech self-supervised learning, addressing the limitations of prior studies which focused on isolated tasks.

**Method:** The study utilizes Mamba-based HuBERT models in conjunction with the linear-time Selective State Space for long-context ASR fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated strong performance of Mamba-based HuBERT in speech SSL tasks.
	2. Achieved lower compute requirements while maintaining high performance for long-context ASR.
	3. Outperformed Transformer-based models in capturing speaker-related features.

**Result:** Mamba-based models achieve superior performance in streaming ASR and show competitive results on SUPERB probing benchmarks, with better quantized representations and clearer speaker feature capture compared to Transformers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mamba-based SSL is a promising avenue for improving long-sequence modeling and real-time speech applications.

**Abstract:** While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute. Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR. Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

**Motivation:** To guide engineers in minimizing asset downtime through improved language model understanding of asset maintenance queries.

**Method:** The study gathers a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to create nine asset-specific task datasets. It employs LLMs to augment tasks, generating contextually informed embeddings. These embeddings are integrated into a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct) for complex query resolution.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an asset-specific task datasets for maintenance tasks
	2. Integration of LLMs for enhancing embedding quality
	3. Demonstration of advanced reasoning and planning capabilities in model application

**Result:** The integration of LLM query augmentation significantly improves embedding quality and performance metrics such as HIT@1 (up by +54.2%), MAP@100 (up by +50.1%), and NDCG@10 (up by +54.7%). The model also demonstrates advanced planning and tool invocation capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study showcases the effectiveness of using LLMs and a reasoning agent in supporting Subject Matter Experts in industrial asset maintenance tasks.

**Abstract:** In this work we focus on improving language models' understanding for asset maintenance to guide the engineer's decisions and minimize asset downtime. Given a set of tasks expressed in natural language for Industry 4.0 domain, each associated with queries related to a specific asset, we want to recommend relevant items and generalize to queries of similar assets. A task may involve identifying relevant sensors given a query about an asset's failure mode.   Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets. To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries. This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference.   Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples. After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations.

**Motivation:** To improve Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) through a comprehensive corpus that encapsulates dialect and domain variations.

**Method:** The paper introduces the Konooz corpus, which includes manual annotations of 21 entity types across 16 Arabic dialects and benchmarks four existing Arabic NER models using this corpus.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the Konooz corpus covering 16 Arabic dialects across diverse domains.
	2. Benchmarking study of existing Arabic NER models highlighting performance drops in cross-domain and cross-dialect settings.
	3. Analysis of resource scarcity effects on NER performance with a focus on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy metric.

**Result:** Benchmarking revealed performance drops of up to 38% for NER models when applying them to cross-domain and cross-dialect scenarios compared to in-distribution data.

**Limitations:** The performance analysis is limited to four specific NER models and may not represent all current models in Arabic NER.

**Conclusion:** The study illustrates the challenges in NER model performance due to dialectal and domain divergences, emphasizing the importance of the Konooz corpus in addressing these issues.

**Abstract:** We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21 entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity. We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform better on specific dialects and domains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of OpenUnlearning framework
	2. Integration of multiple unlearning algorithms and evaluation metrics
	3. Proposal of a meta-evaluation benchmark for metrics

**Result:** The framework integrates 9 unlearning algorithms, 16 evaluations across 3 benchmarks, and analyzes forgetting behaviors across numerous checkpoints.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** OpenUnlearning establishes a community pathway for enhanced rigor in LLM unlearning research.

**Abstract:** Robust unlearning is crucial for safely deploying large language models (LLMs) in environments where data privacy, model safety, and regulatory compliance must be ensured. Yet the task is inherently challenging, partly due to difficulties in reliably measuring whether unlearning has truly occurred. Moreover, fragmentation in current methodologies and inconsistent evaluation metrics hinder comparative analysis and reproducibility. To unify and accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning methods and metrics. OpenUnlearning integrates 9 unlearning algorithms and 16 diverse evaluations across 3 leading benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP) and also enables analyses of forgetting behaviors across 450+ checkpoints we publicly release. Leveraging OpenUnlearning, we propose a novel meta-evaluation benchmark focused specifically on assessing the faithfulness and robustness of evaluation metrics themselves. We also benchmark diverse unlearning methods and provide a comparative analysis against an extensive evaluation suite. Overall, we establish a clear, community-driven pathway toward rigorous development in LLM unlearning research.

**Motivation:** To explore how AI-generated poetry can inspire creativity in artistic processes.

**Method:** Comparative analysis of poetry generated by LSTM-VAE and LLMs, along with the composition of an original poem based on LSTM-VAE lines.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of the evocative impact of LSTM-VAE poetry.
	2. Comparison of LSTM-VAE and LLM-generated poetry.
	3. Original poem composition using LSTM-VAE lines.

**Result:** LSTM-VAE lines impact artists through resonant imagery and open semantics, whereas LLMs produce structurally conventional poetry.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AI-generated poetic lines can serve as novel starting points for authentic artistic expression, especially through LSTM-VAE's unique characteristics.

**Abstract:** Artistic inspiration often emerges from language that is open to interpretation. This paper explores the use of AI-generated poetic lines as stimuli for creativity. Through analysis of two generative AI approaches--lines generated by Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoders (LSTM-VAE) and complete poems by Large Language Models (LLMs)--I demonstrate that LSTM-VAE lines achieve their evocative impact through a combination of resonant imagery and productive indeterminacy. While LLMs produce technically accomplished poetry with conventional patterns, LSTM-VAE lines can engage the artist through semantic openness, unconventional combinations, and fragments that resist closure. Through the composition of an original poem, where narrative emerged organically through engagement with LSTM-VAE generated lines rather than following a predetermined structure, I demonstrate how these characteristics can serve as evocative starting points for authentic artistic expression.

**Abstract:** Wikipedia is a critical resource for modern NLP, serving as a rich repository of up-to-date and citation-backed information on a wide variety of subjects. The reliability of Wikipedia -- its groundedness in its cited sources -- is vital to this purpose. This work provides a quantitative analysis of the extent to which Wikipedia *is* so grounded and of how readily grounding evidence may be retrieved. To this end, we introduce PeopleProfiles -- a large-scale, multi-level dataset of claim support annotations on Wikipedia articles of notable people. We show that roughly 20% of claims in Wikipedia *lead* sections are unsupported by the article body; roughly 27% of annotated claims in the article *body* are unsupported by their (publicly accessible) cited sources; and >80% of lead claims cannot be traced to these sources via annotated body evidence. Further, we show that recovery of complex grounding evidence for claims that *are* supported remains a challenge for standard retrieval methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of persona traits on moral reasoning and persuasive behavior in large language models, particularly in sensitive domains.

**Method:** A large-scale study simulating AI-AI debates using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class, ideology, personality) over 131 relationship-based cases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First large-scale study of persona effects in AI debates
	2. Identification of key persona traits affecting moral reasoning
	3. Reinforcement of the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks in AI

**Result:** Personas notably affect initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and personality traits showing the most influence. Liberal and open personalities yield higher consensus and win rates, while emotional appeals wane over the course of debates.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to AI agents and may not completely represent human moral reasoning dynamics.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the necessity for persona-aware evaluation frameworks in AI moral reasoning, reflecting psychological and cultural insights.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class, ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies, reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral reasoning.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the effectiveness of training models on redacted text versus realistic pseudo text for de-identifying protected health information, achieving significant improvements in performance.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of training clinical foundation models on redacted text, which is crucial for privacy in health informatics.

**Method:** Pretraining encoder-only models on datasets with redacted text and realistic pseudo text, followed by fine-tuning these models for the task of de-identifying protected health information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel findings on training methods for de-identification tasks
	2. Development of a dataset with redacted text replacements
	3. Provision of pretrained embeddings and task-specific models

**Result:** The proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baselines in the de-identification task.

**Limitations:** Not specified

**Conclusion:** Training recommendations and insights into using redacted text versus pseudo text are provided, along with accessible resources for further research.

**Abstract:** Many models are pretrained on redacted text for privacy reasons. Clinical foundation models are often trained on de-identified text, which uses special syntax (masked) text in place of protected health information. Even though these models have increased in popularity, there has been little effort in understanding the effects of training them on redacted text. In this work, we pretrain several encoder-only models on a dataset that contains redacted text and a version with replaced realistic pseudo text. We then fine-tuned models for the protected health information de-identification task and show how our methods significantly outperform previous baselines. The contributions of this work include: a) our novel, and yet surprising findings with training recommendations, b) redacted text replacements used to produce the pseudo dataset, c) pretrained embeddings and fine-tuned task specific models, and d) freely available pseudo training dataset generation and model source code used in our experiments.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** realignment, language models, logit fusion, inference, adaptation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a flexible framework for realigning language models during training and inference through controllable fusion of logits and adaptive layer configurations, achieving significant reductions in token usage and improvements in reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the performance of language models that fail to meet expected outcomes by implementing a flexible alignment framework.

**Method:** The framework introduces Training-time Realignment (TrRa) for efficient model realignment through logit fusion, and Inference-time Realignment (InRa), using a layer adapter to adaptively process inputs at inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a flexible realignment framework for LMs.
	2. Development of TrRa for efficient training-time realignment.
	3. Implementation of InRa for dynamic inference alignment.

**Result:** TrRa achieves a 54.63% reduction in token usage on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without performance loss, surpassing DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods enable fast and slow thinking capabilities in models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, allowing for more profound reasoning and better overall performance.

**Abstract:** Realignment becomes necessary when a language model (LM) fails to meet expected performance. We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during inference. By encouraging deeper reasoning, it even surpassed its original performance.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces IndoHateMix, a dataset aimed at improving hate speech detection in code-mixed Hindi-English contexts and demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the unique challenges of hate speech detection in diverse and code-mixed online environments, particularly in social media.

**Method:** The authors introduce IndoHateMix, a dataset capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and conduct experiments comparing LLMs to BERT-based models in hate speech detection tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the IndoHateMix dataset for Hindi-English code-mixing.
	2. Demonstration of superior performance of LLMs in hate speech detection tasks compared to BERT-based models.
	3. Discussion on future directions for hate speech detection focusing on dataset quality.

**Result:** Experiments show that LLMs, like LLaMA-3.1, consistently outperform BERT-based models, even with less training data, demonstrating superior generalization.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLMs may redefine hate speech detection strategies, suggesting a shift towards either developing specialized models or enriching datasets for better effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Hate speech detection across contemporary social media presents unique challenges due to linguistic diversity and the informal nature of online discourse. These challenges are further amplified in settings involving code-mixing, transliteration, and culturally nuanced expressions. While fine-tuned transformer models, such as BERT, have become standard for this task, we argue that recent large language models (LLMs) not only surpass them but also redefine the landscape of hate speech detection more broadly. To support this claim, we introduce IndoHateMix, a diverse, high-quality dataset capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and transliteration in the Indian context, providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate model robustness in complex multilingual scenarios where existing NLP methods often struggle. Our extensive experiments show that cutting-edge LLMs (such as LLaMA-3.1) consistently outperform task-specific BERT-based models, even when fine-tuned on significantly less data. With their superior generalization and adaptability, LLMs offer a transformative approach to mitigating online hate in diverse environments. This raises the question of whether future works should prioritize developing specialized models or focus on curating richer and more varied datasets to further enhance the effectiveness of LLMs.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, bias, geopolitical values, democracy-authoritarianism spectrum, model favorability

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper assesses the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with geopolitical value systems, specifically the democracy-authoritarianism spectrum, revealing a general favor toward democratic values but also significant bias towards authoritarian figures in certain contexts.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how LLMs align with broader geopolitical value systems beyond traditional socio-demographic and political dimensions.

**Method:** The study utilizes a combination of the F-scale for authoritarian tendencies, FavScore for evaluating favorability toward world leaders, and role-model probing for assessing cited figures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel methodology to assess LLMs' alignment with geopolitical value systems.
	2. Revealed that LLMs exhibit biases toward both democratic and authoritarian values based on language prompts.
	3. Highlighted the necessity of evaluating biases beyond conventional socio-political axes.

**Result:** Findings indicate that LLMs favor democratic values overall but show increased favorability towards authoritarian figures when prompted in Mandarin, often citing authoritarian figures as role models in various contexts.

**Limitations:** The study's scope may be limited by the languages and contexts in which the models were tested, potentially affecting generalizability.

**Conclusion:** Evaluating biases in LLMs should consider geopolitical ideologies, as they may reinforce and reflect political biases across different cultures.

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday life and information ecosystems, concerns about their implicit biases continue to persist. While prior work has primarily examined socio-demographic and left--right political dimensions, little attention has been paid to how LLMs align with broader geopolitical value systems, particularly the democracy--authoritarianism spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric tool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced metric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3) role-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by LLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but exhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in Mandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role models, even outside explicit political contexts. These results shed light on ways LLMs may reflect and potentially reinforce global political ideologies, highlighting the importance of evaluating bias beyond conventional socio-political axes.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Surprise Calibration (SC), a novel method for addressing biases in in-context learning of large language models by leveraging implicit sequential Bayesian inference and the concept of surprise for dynamic class prior adjustments.

**Read time:** 16 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of in-context learning in large language models by addressing biases that arise from prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations.

**Method:** The authors propose Surprise Calibration (SC), using implicit sequential Bayesian inference to interpret in-context learning and identify 'surprise' as a signal for adjusting class priors dynamically.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Surprise Calibration (SC) for bias mitigation in ICL
	2. Use of implicit sequential Bayesian inference in adapting class priors
	3. Empirical validation of SC's superiority over existing methods

**Result:** Surprise Calibration demonstrates significantly better performance in comparison to existing bias calibration techniques across various natural language processing benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adopting surprise as a means to understand dynamic class priors offers a more adaptive and efficient approach to in-context learning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for task adaptation in large language models (LLMs), where models infer underlying task structures from a few demonstrations. However, ICL remains susceptible to biases that arise from prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations, which can degrade the performance of LLMs. Existing bias calibration methods typically apply fixed class priors across all inputs, limiting their efficacy in dynamic ICL settings where the context for each query differs. To address these limitations, we adopt implicit sequential Bayesian inference as a framework for interpreting ICL, identify "surprise" as an informative signal for class prior shift, and introduce a novel method--Surprise Calibration (SC). SC leverages the notion of surprise to capture the temporal dynamics of class priors, providing a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context learning. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of SC over existing bias calibration techniques across a range of benchmark natural language processing tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the challenge of distinguishing human-written text from AI-generated text, particularly in light of advancements in LLMs like ChatGPT.

**Method:** The authors employ sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models T5-small and BART to modify GPT-generated sentences to appear more like human-written text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced adversarial transformation for GPT-generated text.
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART in making AI text appear more human-like.
	3. Provided insights into the implications of text transformation on text classification model performance.

**Result:** Experiments show that classification models struggle to accurately identify GPT-generated texts modified by Seq2Seq, but retrained models achieve high accuracy in distinguishing them from authentic human texts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research enhances understanding of text transformations, highlighting their dual role in both undermining and improving text classification capabilities.

**Abstract:** Due to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the boundary between human-written text and AI-generated text has become blurred. Nevertheless, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to reliably detect GPT-generated text. In this paper, we adopt a novel strategy to adversarially transform GPT-generated text using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, with the goal of making the text more human-like. We experiment with the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models. However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy. This work adds to the accumulating knowledge of text transformation as a tool for both attack -- in the sense of defeating classification models -- and defense -- in the sense of improved classifiers -- thereby advancing our understanding of AI-generated text.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issue of overthinking in Long Chain-of-Thought models that leads to redundant reasoning, especially for simple questions.

**Method:** A fine-tuning approach called Question-Free Fine-Tuning (QFFT) eliminates the input question during training, focusing on learning from Long CoT responses to adaptively use both Short and Long CoT patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces Question-Free Fine-Tuning (QFFT) as a novel approach to model training.
	2. Demonstrates significant reduction in response length without sacrificing performance.
	3. Shows improved adaptability in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource scenarios.

**Result:** QFFT reduces the average response length by over 50% while maintaining performance comparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and demonstrating better results in challenging scenarios such as noisy and low-resource environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** QFFT enhances reasoning efficiency by prioritizing Short CoT patterns while activating Long CoT patterns only when necessary, improving model adaptability and performance in various contexts.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning models have improved performance on complex tasks, but they suffer from overthinking, which generates redundant reasoning steps, especially for simple questions. This paper revisits the reasoning patterns of Long and Short CoT models, observing that the Short CoT patterns offer concise reasoning efficiently, while the Long CoT patterns excel in challenging scenarios where the Short CoT patterns struggle. To enable models to leverage both patterns, we propose Question-Free Fine-Tuning (QFFT), a fine-tuning approach that removes the input question during training and learns exclusively from Long CoT responses. This approach enables the model to adaptively employ both reasoning patterns: it prioritizes the Short CoT patterns and activates the Long CoT patterns only when necessary. Experiments on various mathematical datasets demonstrate that QFFT reduces average response length by more than 50\%, while achieving performance comparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, QFFT exhibits superior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource scenarios.

**Motivation:** To develop more accurate and efficient legal retrieval systems by understanding the effectiveness of different retrieval methods in handling repetitive legal language.

**Method:** Qualitative and quantitative analysis using metrics to compare the performance of lexical models (like BM25) and dense retrieval models on legal language.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comparison of retrieval methods for legal language
	2. Insight into the performance of BM25 versus dense models
	3. Analysis of fine-tuning effects on retrieval accuracy

**Result:** Lexical and dense models perform well on repetitive language scenarios; BM25 outperforms dense models in nuanced conditions. Fine-tuning dense models on domain-specific data can improve performance significantly.

**Limitations:** Limited to legal language and decisions from the CJEU; results may vary in other legal contexts.

**Conclusion:** BM25 is a strong baseline but fine-tuning dense models can surpass it in many performance metrics, demonstrating the importance of domain-specific training data.

**Abstract:** Legal passage retrieval is an important task that assists legal practitioners in the time-intensive process of finding relevant precedents to support legal arguments. This study investigates the task of retrieving legal passages or paragraphs from decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), whose language is highly structured and formulaic, leading to repetitive patterns. Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4 out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on the model's performance and temporal robustness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The JEBS dataset and task support targeted development and evaluation of systems aimed at simplifying biomedical text for broader accessibility.

**Abstract:** Online medical literature has made health information more available than ever, however, the barrier of complex medical jargon prevents the general public from understanding it. Though parallel and comparable corpora for Biomedical Text Simplification have been introduced, these conflate the many syntactic and lexical operations involved in simplification. To enable more targeted development and evaluation, we present a fine-grained lexical simplification task and dataset, Jargon Explanations for Biomedical Simplification (JEBS, https://github.com/bill-from-ri/JEBS-data ). The JEBS task involves identifying complex terms, classifying how to replace them, and generating replacement text. The JEBS dataset contains 21,595 replacements for 10,314 terms across 400 biomedical abstracts and their manually simplified versions. Additionally, we provide baseline results for a variety of rule-based and transformer-based systems for the three sub-tasks. The JEBS task, data, and baseline results pave the way for development and rigorous evaluation of systems for replacing or explaining complex biomedical terms.

**Motivation:** The need for a high-quality benchmark to accurately evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities without data contamination and proper representation of diverse disciplines.

**Method:** The authors created SciDA, which consists of over 1,000 Olympic-level numerical computation problems with the ability to randomize numerical values for each inference to prevent memorization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark (SciDA) specifically for evaluating numerical reasoning in LLMs.
	2. Utilization of randomized numerical initializations to combat data contamination.
	3. Large-scale evaluation with both closed-source and open-source LLMs.

**Result:** Experimental results show that the performance of LLMs significantly decreases when subjected to randomized numerical initialization, indicating the limitations of their numerical reasoning capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SciDA offers an unbiased assessment tool that highlights the actual reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in numerical contexts, and addresses data contamination issues present in existing benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities enables them to solve scientific problems with enhanced efficacy. Thereby, a high-quality benchmark for comprehensive and appropriate assessment holds significance, while existing ones either confront the risk of data contamination or lack involved disciplines. To be specific, due to the data source overlap of LLMs training and static benchmark, the keys or number pattern of answers inadvertently memorized (i.e. data contamination), leading to systematic overestimation of their reasoning capabilities, especially numerical reasoning. We propose SciDA, a multidisciplinary benchmark that consists exclusively of over 1k Olympic-level numerical computation problems, allowing randomized numerical initializations for each inference round to avoid reliance on fixed numerical patterns. We conduct a series of experiments with both closed-source and open-source top-performing LLMs, and it is observed that the performance of LLMs drop significantly under random numerical initialization. Thus, we provide truthful and unbiased assessments of the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/SciDA

**TL;DR:** Introducing PersonaFeedback, a benchmark for evaluating LLM personalization based on distinct user personas, with a focus on tailored responses.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rapid improvement in LLM capabilities necessitates effective evaluation benchmarks for LLM personalization to overcome the lack of such resources and advance research in the field.

**Method:** PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers, focusing on the model's ability to generate personalized responses based on predefined user personas.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PersonaFeedback benchmark for LLM personalization
	2. Decoupled persona inference from personalization in evaluations
	3. Comprehensive evaluations across various models with publicly available data and protocols

**Result:** Empirical evaluations show state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with the hard tier of PersonaFeedback, revealing limitations in their personalization capabilities even when they excel at complex reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** Current retrieval-augmented frameworks are insufficient for addressing personalization tasks effectively.

**Conclusion:** The benchmark and accompanying resources aim to facilitate further research in LLM personalization by providing a standardized evaluation framework.

**Abstract:** With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become an increasingly important research and engineering problem. However, unlike many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas. PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems, demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data, annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to facilitate future research on LLM personalization.

We annotate behavior codes following an existing framework to understand the teamwork process for CliniDial. We pinpoint three main characteristics of our dataset, including its label imbalances, rich and natural interactions, and multiple modalities, and conduct experiments to test existing LLMs' capabilities on handling data with these characteristics. Experimental results show that CliniDial poses significant challenges to the existing models, inviting future effort on developing methods that can deal with real-world clinical data.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to understand why bilingual and multilingual models perform inconsistently across different languages and to identify effective strategies for improving their performance.

**Method:** The authors conduct an analysis comparing bilingual and monolingual language models, focusing on data quality and its impact on performance degradation. They propose a data filtering strategy to enhance bilingual training sets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies data quality as a key factor affecting multilingual model performance.
	2. Proposes a data filtering strategy that improves overall model performance.
	3. Demonstrates practical improvements in performance for multiple languages using the proposed method.

**Result:** The approach improves monolingual performance by 2-4% for languages such as French, German, and Chinese, and significantly reduces performance gaps in bilingual models to just 1%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results underscore the critical role of data quality in multilingual pretraining and provide a straightforward method for addressing performance disparities.

**Abstract:** Bilingual and multilingual language models offer a promising path toward scaling NLP systems across diverse languages and users. However, their performance often varies wildly between languages as prior works show that adding more languages can degrade performance for some languages (such as English), while improving others (typically more data constrained languages). In this work, we investigate causes of these inconsistencies by comparing bilingual and monolingual language models. Our analysis reveals that unequal data quality, not just data quantity, is a major driver of performance degradation in bilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective data filtering strategy to select higher-quality bilingual training data with only high quality English data. Applied to French, German, and Chinese, our approach improves monolingual performance by 2-4% and reduces bilingual model performance gaps to 1%. These results highlight the overlooked importance of data quality in multilingual pretraining and offer a practical recipe for balancing performance.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a method to mitigate media bias in summarization by utilizing a multi-document event relation graph to provide rich contextual information about events, improving both neutrality and content preservation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the growing partisanship and polarization in media by focusing on how to create neutral summaries from ideologically diverse articles, driven by the need to enhance awareness of bias in language models.

**Method:** A multi-document event relation graph is created to capture various types of event relationships and moral opinions, which are then integrated into LLMs for neutralized summarization through both hard and soft prompting strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-document event relation graph for bias mitigation in summarization
	2. Development of dual strategies for integrating the graph into LLMs
	3. Demonstration of improved content preservation alongside reduced bias in generated summaries.

**Result:** The method successfully mitigates lexical and informational media bias while maintaining content integrity, as evidenced by both automatic and human evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed strategies demonstrate effective means of reducing media bias and enhancing the neutrality of summaries generated by language models.

**Abstract:** Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays. Most previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles presenting different ideological views. Motivated by the critical role of events and event relations in media bias detection, we propose to increase awareness of bias in LLMs via multi-document events reasoning and use a multi-document event relation graph to guide the summarization process. This graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical and informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a novel plug-and-play method for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) that integrates a detachable memory module for syntactic knowledge into large language models, improving performance with minimal fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing aspect-based sentiment analysis methods rely on resource-intensive LLMs which can be difficult to fine-tune effectively in data-scarce environments.

**Method:** The approach introduces a memory module that captures syntactic information, which can be independently trained and acts as a plugin to enhance LLMs for predicting sentiment polarities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a detachable memory module for syntactic knowledge
	2. Improvement of sentiment prediction in ABSA
	3. Demonstration of effective use of LLMs with minimal resources

**Result:** Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches in aspect-based sentiment analysis.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach demonstrates effectiveness in improving sentiment prediction with minimal effort, showcasing the potential of plug-and-play methods in LLM applications.

**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies. Most existing studies employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context, especially large language models (LLMs). However, training these encoders is resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for necessary fine-tuning. Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. As a result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs to ABSA with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). Specifically, we propose a memory module that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct the prediction of sentiment polarities. Importantly, this encoder acts as a versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its effectiveness.

**Motivation:** To investigate the performance of large language models in literary translation and their alignment with human stylistic features.

**Method:** A computational stylometry analysis comparing the stylistic features of GPT-4 translations with human translations in a Chinese online literature task.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Presentation of computational stylometry analysis in literary translation
	2. Comparison of GPT-4 performance with human translations
	3. Insights into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective

**Result:** GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations regarding lexical, syntactic, and content features, indicating that LLMs can replicate a human-like touch in literary translation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that LLMs may blur the lines between machine and human translations in literary contexts, offering insights into AI's role in this area.

**Abstract:** Existing research indicates that machine translations (MTs) of literary texts are often unsatisfactory. MTs are typically evaluated using automated metrics and subjective human ratings, with limited focus on stylistic features. Evidence is also limited on whether state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) will reshape literary translation. This study examines the stylistic features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry.

**Motivation:** The research aims to investigate the applicability of embedding alignment in low-resource languages, an area that has been overlooked in existing studies predominantly focused on high-resource languages.

**Method:** The study implements a supervised embedding alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba and analyzes the effects of embedding quality and normalization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates supervised embedding alignment's limitations for low-resource languages
	2. Establishes the importance of high-quality monolingual embeddings
	3. Provides a foundation for future research on machine translation for low-resource languages.

**Result:** Findings indicate that higher quality embeddings and normalization improve translation precision significantly and reveal an interaction effect between the two factors.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on English to Yoruba translation and may not generalize to other low-resource languages without further investigation.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the limitations of current embedding alignment approaches for low-resource languages and stresses the need for high-quality monolingual embeddings.

**Abstract:** In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that low-resource languages face.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study is motivated by the debate regarding the necessity of parallel data for multilingual language models, especially as some LLMs perform well even without explicit training on such data.

**Method:** The authors conduct a systematic investigation through controlled experiments to evaluate the impact of incorporating parallel data into LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic evaluation of the role of parallel data in LLMs
	2. Controlled experiments showcasing improved multilingual capabilities
	3. Discussion on the implications of bilingual signals in training data

**Result:** The results indicate that adding parallel data can notably enhance the multilingual abilities of LLMs, particularly in translation and common-sense reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings challenge the notion that parallel data is obsolete for training LLMs and demonstrate its importance for improving translation quality and reasoning.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data. Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the unexploited potential of MLLMs in financial analysis and calls for further optimization and development to enhance their application in the financial domain.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved with the growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and are now applied in various fields. In finance, the integration of diverse modalities such as text, charts, and tables is crucial for accurate and efficient decision-making. Therefore, an effective evaluation system that incorporates these data types is essential for advancing financial application. In this paper, we introduce CFBenchmark-MM, a Chinese multimodal financial benchmark with over 9,000 image-question pairs featuring tables, histogram charts, line charts, pie charts, and structural diagrams. Additionally, we develop a staged evaluation system to assess MLLMs in handling multimodal information by providing different visual content step by step. Despite MLLMs having inherent financial knowledge, experimental results still show limited efficiency and robustness in handling multimodal financial context. Further analysis on incorrect responses reveals the misinterpretation of visual content and the misunderstanding of financial concepts are the primary issues. Our research validates the significant, yet underexploited, potential of MLLMs in financial analysis, highlighting the need for further development and domain-specific optimization to encourage the enhanced use in financial domain.

**TL;DR:** Multipole Attention accelerates long chain-of-thought reasoning in Large Reasoning Models by computing exact attention for important tokens and approximating others, achieving up to 4.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large Reasoning Models need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning for complex problem-solving, but existing methods struggle with efficiency and accuracy during this process.

**Method:** The proposed Multipole Attention method clusters semantically similar key vectors and computes exact attention for important tokens while approximating others, plus includes a fast cluster update process for enhanced efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces Multipole Attention for efficient long chain-of-thought reasoning
	2. Clustering mechanism improves attention calculation efficiency
	3. Demonstrates practical efficiency gains with kernel implementations

**Result:** Evaluation on models like Qwen-8B shows that Multipole Attention maintains accuracy even with aggressive attention sparsity, achieving significant speed improvements in long-context reasoning.

**Limitations:** Potential challenges in real-time implementation and adaptation to varying input types.

**Conclusion:** Multipole Attention offers a viable approach for enhancing the efficiency of Large Reasoning Models without sacrificing accuracy, making it suitable for complex reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

**Motivation:** There is a need to evaluate how well LLMs can mimic human-like motivations, as previous benchmarks are too simplistic and lack character identity.

**Method:** MotiveBench includes 200 contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning tasks to evaluate various levels of motivation in LLMs, conducting experiments across seven notable model families.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MotiveBench dataset for evaluating motivational reasoning in LLMs
	2. Discovery of LLMs' limitations in replicating specific human motivations
	3. Provision of a framework for future studies on LLM humanization

**Result:** Experiments revealed that advanced LLMs struggle with human-like motivational reasoning, particularly with 'love & belonging' motivations, often displaying excessive rationality and idealism.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may still not cover all real-world complexities and nuances of human motivations.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest important directions for improving the humanization of LLMs and contribute essential tools for future research in this area.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as the core of agent frameworks in various scenarios, such as social simulations and AI companions. However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning. Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available at https://aka.ms/motivebench.

**Conclusion:** FinLMM-R1 significantly enhances the multimodal reasoning capability in LMMs for financial applications, demonstrating effectiveness through various benchmarks that validate its methodology.

**Abstract:** Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, financial applications face challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets and the inefficiency of existing training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1] with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth over existing reasoning LMMs in both general and financial multimodal contexts.

We demonstrate how these methods work together and effectively improve entity handling while maintaining high-quality translations.

**Keywords:** in-context learning, large language models, agentic tasks, demonstration selection, trajectory snippets

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates a novel algorithm for using in-context learning (ICL) with LLMs to improve performance in agentic tasks by efficiently annotating and selecting demonstration trajectories.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the performance of LLMs on agentic tasks that require sequential decision-making through effective use of in-context learning (ICL) with selected demonstrations.

**Method:** An algorithm is proposed that leverages LLMs with retries and demonstration selection to automatically annotate agentic tasks, improving performance by using smaller trajectory snippets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A novel algorithm for using LLMs to annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness of trajectory selection in improving LLM agent performance
	3. Reduction of inference cost by using small trajectory snippets instead of full trajectories.

**Result:** The approach significantly improves the reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents, even allowing ICL agents to compete with more costly trained agents.

**Limitations:** The reliance on the quality of trajectory demonstrations and the potential for inference cost overhead with larger models.

**Conclusion:** Careful application of ICL can substantially enhance LLM performance on agentic tasks, mitigating the overhead of large demonstration trajectories by utilizing smaller snippets.

**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) with dynamically selected demonstrations combines the flexibility of prompting large language models (LLMs) with the ability to leverage training data to improve performance. While ICL has been highly successful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks that require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not only about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select demonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to show them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM with retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that set-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly improves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents. However, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We show that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every step instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained from larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and that ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results reveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as well.

**Motivation:** To enhance the ability of LLMs in performing high-level semantic and linguistic analysis of academic texts.

**Method:** A systematic, multi-run evaluation of two LLMs (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) using structured workflow prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a suite of structured workflow prompts for LLMs
	2. Empirical evaluation of model performance on semantic and linguistic tasks
	3. Insight into context-dependent performance of LLMs

**Result:** Gemini outperformed ChatGPT in identifying specific unsubstantiated claims, while both models performed well in linguistic analysis, demonstrating context dependencies.

**Limitations:** The findings may not generalize to all LLMs and varying academic domains.

**Conclusion:** Structured prompting is effective for complex textual analysis, but performance varies significantly with model choice, task type, and context.

**Abstract:** We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic and linguistic analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial analytical tasks: identifying unsubstantiated claims in summaries (informational integrity) and flagging ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially degraded. Our findings suggest that structured prompting is a viable methodology for complex textual analysis but show that prompt performance may be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context, highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

**Motivation:** To explore a sustainable and interpretable method for information extraction using a combination of rules and machine learning, addressing the limitations of solely relying on ML or LLMs.

**Method:** Development of the REST decision tool that visualizes entity formalization in texts and compares the feasibility of rule-based versus ML approaches for information extraction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the REST decision tool for information extraction tasks
	2. Validation of REST's feasibility and performance metrics
	3. Promotion of a sustainable approach combining rules and ML.

**Result:** REST demonstrated good reproducibility on a 12-entity use case, providing metrics that facilitate the selection of annotation methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of rules and ML allows for easier annotation and better management of information extraction tasks, minimizing the need for extensive ML training data.

**Abstract:** Rules could be an information extraction (IE) default option, compared to ML and LLMs in terms of sustainability, transferability, interpretability, and development burden. We suggest a sustainable and combined use of rules and ML as an IE method. Our approach starts with an exhaustive expert manual highlighting in a single working session of a representative subset of the data corpus. We developed and validated the feasibility and the performance metrics of the REST decision tool to help the annotator choose between rules as a by default option and ML for each entity of an IE task. REST makes the annotator visualize the characteristics of each entity formalization in the free texts and the expected rule development feasibility and IE performance metrics. ML is considered as a backup IE option and manual annotation for training is therefore minimized. The external validity of REST on a 12-entity use case showed good reproducibility.

**Motivation:** The thesis aims to improve the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their reliability and reduce factual inaccuracies.

**Method:** A systematic framework is introduced that includes contrastive error detection for identifying incorrect facts, an attribute-aware framework for error correction, and an inductive completion model for refining KGs. It concludes with the integration of structured graph reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Contrastive error detection for identifying incorrect facts in KGs
	2. Attribute-aware framework for unifying structural and semantic signals
	3. Inductive completion model for refining KGs

**Result:** The proposed framework significantly enhances the robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs by using verified and refined Knowledge Graphs.

**Limitations:** Potential noise and incompleteness in KGs remain challenges, as well as the complexity of integrating rigid KGs with flexible LLM reasoning.

**Conclusion:** The systematic approach demonstrates that improving KGs can lead to better factual grounding in LLMs, thereby addressing their inherent limitations.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations, offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge. However, their potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of LLMs. This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations, advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs through five interconnected contributions. This thesis addresses these challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and leveraging reliable KGs. First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs. This approach is extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic signals for error correction. Next, we propose an inductive completion model that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving KGs. Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding. These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.

**Motivation:** To address the complexity in architecture design by automating parameter allocation without heavy computational costs.

**Method:** DMAO employs a grow-and-drop strategy for reallocating model parameters during training, shifting resources to more beneficial parts of the model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the DMAO framework for architecture optimization
	2. Demonstration of significant performance improvements in WER
	3. Analysis of parameter redistribution patterns and their implications

**Result:** The implementation of DMAO led to consistent improvements in word error rates (WER) by up to 6% across varying architectures and datasets while using the same training resources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DMAO effectively optimizes model training by redistributing parameters, leading to better model performance with negligible overhead.

**Abstract:** Architecture design is inherently complex. Existing approaches rely on either handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful findings.

**Motivation:** Large language models pose privacy and ethical challenges by potentially retaining sensitive information. This research addresses the need for effective unlearning methods to mitigate such issues.

**Method:** Align-then-Unlearn augments LLMs with an embedding prediction module and fine-tunes the model to decrease similarity between predicted embeddings and targeted embeddings representing knowledge to be removed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Align-then-Unlearn framework for semantic embedding-based unlearning

	3. Availability of code for replication and further research

**Result:** Initial results demonstrate that Align-then-Unlearn successfully eliminates targeted knowledge while maintaining overall model performance, showcasing the effectiveness of embedding-based unlearning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Embedding-based unlearning is a promising approach to remove conceptual knowledge from LLMs, addressing privacy concerns effectively.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, they have raised significant privacy and ethical concerns due to their potential to inadvertently retain sensitive information. Unlearning seeks to selectively remove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or copyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at the token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain susceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal degradation in overall model utility. These findings suggest that embedding-based unlearning offers a promising and robust approach to removing conceptual knowledge.

**Conclusion:** The LADDER framework contributes to the development of flexible and creative LLMs, capable of handling complex tasks more effectively.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses. To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.

**Motivation:** To understand how music preferences at the national level encode cultural signals and delineate global cultural boundaries.

**Method:** Collected YouTube Music Charts data from 62 countries, extracted audio embeddings using the CLAP model, and generated semantic captions for each track. Clusters were created based on contrastive embeddings and visualized using t-SNE. Statistical analyses like MANOVA and chi-squared tests were employed to evaluate the results.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified significant alignment between music clusters and cultural zones.
	2. Demonstrated the use of music preferences as proxies for cultural understanding.
	3. Applied novel audio embedding and summarization techniques to music data.

**Result:** Music-based clusters were found to significantly align with cultural groupings as defined by the World Values Survey, showing non-random associations between music preferences and cultural zones.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to popular music data and may not encompass all cultural expressions.

**Conclusion:** National music preferences reflect significant cultural values and can be used to understand cultural boundaries globally.

**Abstract:** This study explores the extent to which national music preferences reflect underlying cultural values. We collected long-term popular music data from YouTube Music Charts across 62 countries, encompassing both Western and non-Western regions, and extracted audio embeddings using the CLAP model. To complement these quantitative representations, we generated semantic captions for each track using LP-MusicCaps and GPT-based summarization. Countries were clustered based on contrastive embeddings that highlight deviations from global musical norms. The resulting clusters were projected into a two-dimensional space via t-SNE for visualization and evaluated against cultural zones defined by the World Values Survey (WVS). Statistical analyses, including MANOVA and chi-squared tests, confirmed that music-based clusters exhibit significant alignment with established cultural groupings. Furthermore, residual analysis revealed consistent patterns of overrepresentation, suggesting non-random associations between specific clusters and cultural zones. These findings indicate that national-level music preferences encode meaningful cultural signals and can serve as a proxy for understanding global cultural boundaries.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap between validation loss and model performance on downstream tasks, which complicates the application of scaling laws for predicting task capabilities.

**Method:** The paper presents the Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes total loss into components with assigned importance weights for tokens, tailored to specific meta-capabilities of models based on varying training data distributions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Capability Salience Vector for token loss weighting
	2. Improved predictability of downstream task capabilities
	3. Analysis of token importance based on training data distribution

**Result:** Experiments show that the Capability Salience Vector significantly enhances the ability to predict downstream task performance of language models across various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method provides a more effective approach to align validation loss with actual downstream performance by considering the unique importance of different tokens.

**Abstract:** Scaling law builds the relationship between training computation and validation loss, enabling researchers to effectively predict the loss trending of models across different levels of computation. However, a gap still remains between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens, which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's capabilities. Experiments on various popular benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Capability Salience Vector could significantly improve the predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Information Gain, Token Decisiveness, Recommendation Systems, Decoding Strategy

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel strategy for improving recommendation accuracy using Large Language Models by incorporating Information Gain to prioritize token decisiveness during training and decoding.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing recommendation methods using LLMs often treat all item tokens equally without considering their contribution to item discrimination, which can lead to suboptimal performance.

**Method:** The authors propose the Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy, which downweights low-Information Gain tokens during tuning and emphasizes high-Information Gain tokens during decoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Information Gain concept for token decisiveness in LLMs
	2. Development of the IGD strategy for tuning and decoding in recommendation tasks
	3. Demonstration of significant improvements in recommendation accuracy on benchmark datasets

**Result:** IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets, showing significant gains on ranking metrics over strong baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By emphasizing token decisiveness, IGD moves beyond traditional likelihood maximization to enhance model performance in recommendations.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task. However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the enhancement of reasoning models through the combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), achieving improved performance in reasoning tasks with a new model, AceReason-Nemotron-1.1.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning can synergistically enhance the performance of reasoning models.

**Method:** The authors curated training data by scaling the number of prompts and responses, then analyzed the impact of SFT on RL outcomes, particularly focusing on sampling temperature during training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated improvements in reasoning performance through SFT scaling strategies.
	2. Established the relationship between SFT strength and RL performance.
	3. Introduced the AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 model, achieving new benchmarks.

**Result:** The findings indicate that stronger SFT models lead to better performance in RL training, with the optimal sampling temperature around 0.3 promoting a balance between exploration and exploitation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 model outperforms previous iterations and achieves state-of-the-art results in reasoning tasks, underscoring the value of combining SFT and RL.

**Abstract:** In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces DualEdit, a model editing framework designed to strengthen the resilience of LLMs against backdoor attacks by optimizing affirmative outputs while mitigating refusal responses.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, and existing editing techniques often lead to safety fallback where models revert to refusals.

**Method:** DualEdit employs a dual-objective approach that includes dynamic loss weighting to balance affirmative responses and refusal suppression, and refusal value anchoring to manage diverse refusal expressions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DualEdit framework for LLMs
	2. Implementation of dynamic loss weighting to balance objectives
	3. Use of refusal value anchoring to manage refusal diversity

**Result:** DualEdit improves attack success rates by 9.98% and reduces safety fallback rates by 10.88% when evaluated on safety-aligned LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework effectively enhances the performance of LLMs under backdoor attack conditions while improving their safety alignment.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Recent model editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses. However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1) Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors, reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, fake reviews, authenticity, consumer psychology, machine psychology

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The study examines the challenges of distinguishing between real and fake product reviews in the age of Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing that both humans and LLMs struggle with this task, displaying different evaluation strategies but equally poor accuracy.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of LLMs on the authenticity of product reviews and the psychology underlying how both humans and machines evaluate these reviews.

**Method:** Three studies were conducted that assessed the ability of humans and LLMs to differentiate between real and fake reviews, measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Revealed the inability of humans and LLMs to distinguish between real and fake reviews clearly.
	2. Introduced concepts of 'scepticism bias' and 'machine psychology' in evaluating review authenticity.
	3. Demonstrated different but equally poor judgment strategies between humans and LLMs.

**Result:** Humans averaged only 50.8% accuracy in identifying fake reviews, similar to chance; LLMs performed equally poorly. Different evaluation strategies were noted, leading to distinct misjudgments.

**Limitations:** The studies may be limited by the specific scenarios of review generation and evaluation, and the results are context-dependent.

**Conclusion:** Review systems are at risk of mechanized fraud without proper verification of reviewer authenticity. Insights into consumer and machine psychology regarding review authenticity are provided, highlighting biases in judgment.

**Abstract:** Reading and evaluating product reviews is central to how most people decide what to buy and consume online. However, the recent emergence of Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores - indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment. The results reveal that review systems everywhere are now susceptible to mechanised fraud if they do not depend on trustworthy purchase verification to guarantee the authenticity of reviewers. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the consumer psychology of how humans judge authenticity, demonstrating there is an inherent 'scepticism bias' towards positive reviews and a special vulnerability to misjudge the authenticity of fake negative reviews. Additionally, results provide a first insight into the 'machine psychology' of judging fake reviews, revealing that the strategies LLMs take to evaluate authenticity radically differ from humans, in ways that are equally wrong in terms of accuracy, but different in their misjudgments.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Numerical consistency across tables in disclosure documents is crucial for accuracy and credibility, necessitating improved methods for automated cross-checking of numerical data.

**Method:** CoFiTCheck uses a coarse-to-fine approach with an embedding-based filtering stage and a discriminative classification stage, enhancing performance through instructional parallel encoding and weak supervision for cross-table relationships.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a coarse-to-fine framework for numerical cross-checking
	2. Implementation of instructional parallel encoding to enhance efficiency
	3. Development of crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm for enriched task-specific training

**Result:** CoFiTCheck outperforms existing methods in efficiency and accuracy across various real-world disclosure documents.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The evaluation shows that CoFiTCheck addresses both the combinatorial challenges and the semantic complexity of numerical data in disclosure documents effectively.

**Abstract:** Numerical consistency across tables in disclosure documents is critical for ensuring accuracy, maintaining credibility, and avoiding reputational and economic risks. Automated tabular numerical cross-checking presents two significant challenges: (C1) managing the combinatorial explosion of candidate instances at the document level and (C2) comprehending multi-faceted numerical semantics. Previous research typically depends on heuristic-based filtering or simplified context extraction, often struggling to balance performance and efficiency. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable contextual understanding capabilities that helps address C2 at the instance level, yet they remain hampered by computational inefficiency (C1) and limited domain expertise. This paper introduces CoFiTCheck, a novel LLM-based coarse-to-fine framework that addresses these challenges through two sequential stages: embedding-based filtering and discriminative classification. The embedding-based filtering stage introduces an instructional parallel encoding method to efficiently represent all numerical mentions in a table with LLMs, as well as a decoupled InfoNCE objective to mitigate the isolated mention problem. The discriminative classification stage employs a specialized LLM for fine-grained analysis of the remaining candidate pairs. This stage is further enhanced by our crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm, which leverages weak supervision from cross-table numerical equality relationships to enrich task-specific priors without requiring manual annotation. Comprehensive evaluation across three types of real-world disclosure documents demonstrates that CoFiTCheck significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining practical efficiency.

**Motivation:** Post-training quantization techniques struggle with Mixture-of-Experts models due to their unique architecture, which can lead to performance degradation.

**Method:** The EAQuant framework introduces expert-aware smoothing aggregation, router logits distribution alignment, and expert-level calibration data balance to enhance quantization for MoE architectures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Expert-aware smoothing aggregation
	2. Router logits distribution alignment
	3. Expert-level calibration data balance

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** EAQuant sets a new standard for high-precision and efficient Mixture-of-Experts model compression, with the code available publicly.

**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a cornerstone of large-scale deep learning by efficiently distributing computation and enhancing performance. However, their unique architecture-characterized by sparse expert activation and dynamic routing mechanisms-introduces inherent complexities that challenge conventional quantization techniques. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods struggle to address activation outliers, router consistency and sparse expert calibration, leading to significant performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose EAQuant, a novel PTQ framework tailored for MoE architectures. Our method systematically tackles these challenges through three key innovations: (1) expert-aware smoothing aggregation to suppress activation outliers and stabilize quantization, (2) router logits distribution alignment to preserve expert selection consistency post-quantization, and (3) expert-level calibration data balance to optimize sparsely activated experts. Extensive experiments across W4A4 and extreme W3A4 quantization configurations demonstrate that EAQuant significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving average score improvements of 1.15 - 2.28% across three diverse MoE architectures, with particularly pronounced gains in reasoning tasks and robust performance retention under aggressive quantization. By integrating these innovations, EAQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art for high-precision, efficient MoE model compression. Our code is available at https://github.com/darren-fzq/EAQuant.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the challenges of applying reinforcement learning techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks due to the lack of verifiable reward signals.

**Method:** The authors propose a new framework called Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO) which utilizes the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3) that focuses on key tokens reflecting the model's reasoning process. This involves dynamic data filtering based on R3.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO) framework for long-form reasoning tasks.
	2. Development of the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3) for fine-tuning LLMs.
	3. Implementation of a dynamic data filtering strategy to reduce costs and improve performance.

**Result:** DRO demonstrates consistent improvement over strong baselines when evaluated on the ParaRev and FinQA datasets, effectively addressing both open-ended and structured reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed DRO framework, equipped with R3 and dynamic data filtering, enhances the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks while maintaining cost efficiency.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

**Motivation:** To address the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating the long-term memory (LTM) abilities of LLMs in complex environments, especially regarding knowledge retention and sequential reasoning.

**Method:** The proposed framework uses interactive fiction games with dynamically branching storylines and hierarchical decision trees to simulate real-world scenarios, testing LLMs' reasoning complexity in two settings: immediate feedback and independent revision.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a benchmark framework for LLMs based on interactive fiction games.
	2. Creation of a new dataset to test LLMs' long-term memory in narrative contexts.
	3. Introduction of two distinct settings for evaluating reasoning complexity.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that the benchmark effectively and reliably assesses LTM in LLMs, showcasing their capabilities in navigating complex reasoning through narrative-driven environments.

**Limitations:** The benchmarks may have limited scope in representing all real-world scenarios due to their structured nature.

**Conclusion:** The new benchmark offers a comprehensive method to evaluate LLM long-term memory, filling existing gaps in current assessment techniques.

**Abstract:** Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs' long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models' LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs' LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an RLVR framework for medical VIE
	2. Achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 100 annotated samples
	3. Demonstration of the importance of reasoning in VIE tasks

**Result:** Significant improvements in F1, precision, and recall metrics on medical VIE tasks compared to previous methods, though performance declines on dissimilar tasks, emphasizing the importance of domain-specific adaptation.

**Limitations:** Performance declines on tasks that are not medically relevant, indicating the need for further domain-specific optimization.

**Conclusion:** Domain-specific optimization is crucial for maximizing performance in medical VIE, as demonstrated by case studies showing the benefits of reasoning during both training and inference.

**Abstract:** Visual Information Extraction (VIE) converts unstructured document images into structured formats like JSON, critical for medical applications such as report analysis and online consultations. Traditional methods rely on OCR and language models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON generation. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit their effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges using only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve field coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1, precision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical datasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for domain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of reasoning during training and inference for VIE.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements on a large multilingual dataset.

**Result:** The proposed method shows an 18% relative improvement on the 1500-hour Multilingual Conversational Speech and Language Model corpus compared to a strong baseline, even outperforming a model trained on 6000 hours of data in the MLC-SLM competition.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of contextual information in multilingual continuous conversational ASR provides significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the integration of language-specific bi-directional context into a speech large language model (SLLM) to improve multilingual continuous conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a character-level contextual masking strategy during training, which randomly removes portions of the context to enhance robustness and better emulate the flawed transcriptions that may occur during inference. For decoding, a two-stage pipeline is utilized: initial isolated segment decoding followed by context-aware re-decoding using neighboring hypotheses. Evaluated on the 1500-hour Multilingual Conversational Speech and Language Model (MLC-SLM) corpus covering eleven languages, our method achieves an 18% relative improvement compared to a strong baseline, outperforming even the model trained on 6000 hours of data for the MLC-SLM competition. These results underscore the significant benefit of incorporating contextual information in multilingual continuous conversational ASR.

**Abstract:** With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results, using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/cspzyy/RealHiTBench.

**Keywords:** word repetition, neural networks, cognitive model, speech errors, brain damage

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper explores modeling the word repetition task using deep neural networks to bridge cognitive models and neural mechanisms in the brain.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the neural mechanisms behind word repetition, especially in light of brain damage that affects speech.

**Method:** The authors trained deep neural network models to simulate word repetition, created tests based on human behavioral studies, and conducted ablation studies to simulate brain damage.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Modeling word repetition using deep neural networks.
	2. Conducting tests based on existing behavioral studies.
	3. Simulating brain damage effects in neural models.

**Result:** Neural models successfully mimicked several effects observed in human research, although some divergences were noted.

**Limitations:** The models may diverge from actual human behavior in certain aspects.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights both the promise of neural models in understanding cognitive processes and the challenges faced in achieving human-like performance.

**Abstract:** It takes several years for the developing brain of a baby to fully master word repetition-the task of hearing a word and repeating it aloud. Repeating a new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition. While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable, allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech errors in the "patient" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects, highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at developing human-like neural models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' general learning abilities which aids in understanding and developing more adaptive AI models.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** NeuroEmbed enhances the construction of automated bioinformatics pipelines by improving the indexing and retrieval of omics data for neurodegenerative diseases.

**Abstract:** The growing volume of omics and clinical data generated for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) requires new approaches for their curation so they can be ready-to-use in bioinformatics. NeuroEmbed is an approach for the engineering of semantically accurate embedding spaces to represent cohorts and samples. The NeuroEmbed method comprises four stages: (1) extraction of ND cohorts from public repositories; (2) semi-automated normalization and augmentation of metadata of cohorts and samples using biomedical ontologies and clustering on the embedding space; (3) automated generation of a natural language question-answering (QA) dataset for cohorts and samples based on randomized combinations of standardized metadata dimensions and (4) fine-tuning of a domain-specific embedder to optimize queries. We illustrate the approach using the GEO repository and the PubMedBERT pretrained embedder. Applying NeuroEmbed, we semantically indexed 2,801 repositories and 150,924 samples. Amongst many biology-relevant categories, we normalized more than 1,700 heterogeneous tissue labels from GEO into 326 unique ontology-aligned concepts and enriched annotations with new ontology-aligned terms, leading to a fold increase in size for the metadata terms between 2.7 and 20 fold. After fine-tuning PubMedBERT with the QA training data augmented with the enlarged metadata, the model increased its mean Retrieval Precision from 0.277 to 0.866 and its mean Percentile Rank from 0.355 to 0.896. The NeuroEmbed methodology for the creation of electronic catalogues of omics cohorts and samples will foster automated bioinformatic pipelines construction.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a novel framework for zero-shot stance detection by leveraging cognitive reasoning and a schema-enhanced graph kernel model, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer labeled examples.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional supervised models in zero-shot stance detection, which struggle with unseen targets and require extensive labeled data.

**Method:** The authors propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF) to abstract reasoning schemas from unlabeled text and integrate them using a Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) that aligns reasoning structures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF) for zero-shot stance detection.
	2. Develops the Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) for aligning reasoning schemas with input arguments.
	3. Achieves significant improvements in macro-F1 scores on multiple benchmarks while reducing reliance on labeled data.

**Result:** CIRF achieves new state-of-the-art results on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks, outperforming existing models and requiring significantly fewer labeled examples.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that cognitive reasoning can effectively enhance zero-shot stance detection, providing methods that require less labeled data without sacrificing performance.

**Abstract:** Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to identify the stance of text toward previously unseen targets, a setting where conventional supervised models often fail due to reliance on labeled data and shallow lexical cues. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF), which abstracts transferable reasoning schemas from unlabeled text and encodes them as concept-level logic. To integrate these schemas with input arguments, we introduce a Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) that dynamically aligns local and global reasoning structures. Experiments on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks show that CIRF establishes new state-of-the-art results, outperforming strong ZSSD baselines by 1.0, 4.5, and 3.3 percentage points in macro-F1, respectively, and achieving comparable accuracy with 70\% fewer labeled examples. We will release the full code upon publication.

**TL;DR:** ROSAQ is a novel rotation-based saliency-aware quantization technique for reducing the memory and improving latency of large language models by focusing on salient channels identified through PCA.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high memory requirements and latency issues of large language models (LLMs) through efficient quantization techniques.

**Method:** ROSAQ involves PCA-based projection for salient channel identification using eigenvalues, and applies mixed-precision quantization (FP16 for salient dimensions, INT3/4 for others).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of rotation-based saliency-aware weight quantization (ROSAQ)
	2. Effective use of PCA for identifying salient channels
	3. Mixed-precision quantization approach for optimized performance

**Result:** ROSAQ outperforms existing saliency-aware quantization methods and provides a 2.3x speedup over FP16 implementation in generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method enhances both latency and memory efficiency for LLMs, offering significant improvements compared to traditional techniques.

**Abstract:** Quantization has been widely studied as an effective technique for reducing the memory requirement of large language models (LLMs), potentially improving the latency time as well. Utilizing the characteristic of rotational invariance of transformer, we propose the rotation-based saliency-aware weight quantization (ROSAQ), which identifies salient channels in the projection feature space, not in the original feature space, where the projected "principal" dimensions are naturally considered as "salient" features. The proposed ROSAQ consists of 1) PCA-based projection, which first performs principal component analysis (PCA) on a calibration set and transforms via the PCA projection, 2) Salient channel dentification, which selects dimensions corresponding to the K-largest eigenvalues as salient channels, and 3) Saliency-aware quantization with mixed-precision, which uses FP16 for salient dimensions and INT3/4 for other dimensions. Experiment results show that ROSAQ shows improvements over the baseline saliency-aware quantization on the original feature space and other existing quantization methods. With kernel fusion, ROSAQ presents about 2.3x speed up over FP16 implementation in generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of current LLM applications in clinical decision support that either assume immediate access to all patient information or do not involve task-specific training.

**Method:** LA-CDM is trained using a hybrid approach combining supervised and reinforcement learning focusing on accurate hypothesis generation, uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LA-CDM as a language agent for clinical decision-making.
	2. Hybrid training paradigm that incorporates both supervised and reinforcement learning.
	3. Demonstrated improved diagnostic performance using real-world clinical data.

**Result:** Evaluation on the MIMIC-CDM dataset demonstrates that LA-CDM significantly enhances diagnostic performance and efficiency through explicit training in clinical decision-making.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study shows that utilizing a structured language agent for clinical decision-making can improve the diagnostic process by making it interactive and iterative.

**Abstract:** Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges and limitations of using LoRAs in large language models, particularly under regulatory or domain constraints.

**Method:** The paper employs theoretical analysis and synthetic tasks to assess the efficacy of reusing LoRAs, focusing on parameter averaging and dynamic adapter selection as two data-agnostic methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of the current approach to LoRA merging and routing
	2. Empirical evaluation of LoRAs' effectiveness in compositional generalization
	3. Call for shifting research direction towards understanding LoRA reuse conditions

**Result:** Empirical evidence shows that reusing LoRAs often does not lead to compositional generalization, particularly when fine-tuning data is disjoint and insufficient during pretraining.

**Limitations:** The paper may not address all potential methodologies for enhancing LoRAs; conclusions are based on specific data-agnostic methods.

**Conclusion:** The authors call for a pause on developing new LoRA merging methods to focus on understanding the conditions under which LoRAs can effectively be reused, advocating for more rigorous research mechanisms in this area.

**Abstract:** Merging or routing low-rank adapters (LoRAs) has emerged as a popular solution for enhancing large language models, particularly when data access is restricted by regulatory or domain-specific constraints. This position paper argues that the research community should shift its focus from developing new merging or routing algorithms to understanding the conditions under which reusing LoRAs is truly effective. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic two-hop reasoning and math word-problem tasks, we examine whether reusing LoRAs enables genuine compositional generalization or merely reflects shallow pattern matching. Evaluating two data-agnostic methods--parameter averaging and dynamic adapter selection--we found that reusing LoRAs often fails to logically integrate knowledge across disjoint fine-tuning datasets, especially when such knowledge is underrepresented during pretraining. Our empirical results, supported by theoretical insights into LoRA's limited expressiveness, highlight the preconditions and constraints of reusing them for unseen tasks and cast doubt on its feasibility as a truly data-free approach. We advocate for pausing the pursuit of novel methods for recycling LoRAs and emphasize the need for rigorous mechanisms to guide future academic research in adapter-based model merging and practical system designs for practitioners.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of evaluation resources for Turkish language models and to study specific linguistic challenges in Turkish that are overlooked in existing benchmarks.

**Method:** Creation of the TurBLiMP benchmark featuring 16 linguistic phenomena and 1000 minimal pairs; evaluation of various language models against this benchmark along with human acceptability judgments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs.
	2. Covering 16 linguistic phenomena for more comprehensive evaluation.
	3. Insights into the performance discrepancies between language models and human linguistic abilities.

**Result:** Experiments show that advanced language models struggle with grammatical phenomena easily handled by humans, with varying sensitivities to word order and morphological complexity.

**Limitations:** The benchmark is specific to Turkish and may not generalize to other languages or linguistic contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the limitations of current language models in handling specific linguistic features of Turkish, underscoring the need for improved evaluation benchmarks.

**Abstract:** We introduce TurBLiMP, the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, designed to evaluate the linguistic abilities of monolingual and multilingual language models (LMs). Covering 16 linguistic phenomena with 1000 minimal pairs each, TurBLiMP fills an important gap in linguistic evaluation resources for Turkish. In designing the benchmark, we give extra attention to two properties of Turkish that remain understudied in current syntactic evaluations of LMs, namely word order flexibility and subordination through morphological processes. Our experiments on a wide range of LMs and a newly collected set of human acceptability judgments reveal that even cutting-edge Large LMs still struggle with grammatical phenomena that are not challenging for humans, and may also exhibit different sensitivities to word order and morphological complexity compared to humans.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current large language models rely heavily on next-word prediction, which often lacks robust reasoning abilities. This research aims to address this limitation.

**Method:** The authors introduce a new reinforcement learning framework, BOW, that creates a reasoning path before token prediction, evaluating its effectiveness through GRPO-based rewards.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a reasoning bottleneck in LLM training
	2. Development of the GRPO reward structure for effective path evaluation
	3. Empirical validation showing improved reasoning capabilities over baseline models

**Result:** BOW outperforms other continual pretraining methods in both general and next-word reasoning tasks, demonstrating improved model capabilities across various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that the BOW framework is a scalable and effective alternative to traditional next-word prediction methods, enhancing reasoning in language models.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction (NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla NWP.

**Abstract:** Language detoxification involves removing toxicity from offensive language. While a neutral-toxic paired dataset provides a straightforward approach for training detoxification models, creating such datasets presents several challenges: i) the need for human annotation to build paired data, and ii) the rapid evolution of offensive terms, rendering static datasets quickly outdated. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated paired data generation pipeline, called K/DA. This pipeline is designed to generate offensive language with implicit offensiveness and trend-aligned slang, making the resulting dataset suitable for detoxification model training. We demonstrate that the dataset generated by K/DA exhibits high pair consistency and greater implicit offensiveness compared to existing Korean datasets, and also demonstrates applicability to other languages. Furthermore, it enables effective training of a high-performing detoxification model with simple instruction fine-tuning.

*Mingxue Xu, Yao Lei Xu, Danilo P. Mandic*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Small Language Models, Tensor-Train Decomposition, energy efficiency, embedding compression, edge applications

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a training-free token embedding compression method for Small Language Models (SLMs) using Tensor-Train Decomposition to enhance their adaptability and energy efficiency on low-end devices.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the need for Small Language Models (SLMs) to be adaptable and energy-efficient for deployment on low-end devices, unlike Large Language Models (LLMs) which focus on increasing model size.

**Method:** A training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD) to convert pre-trained token embedding vectors into lower-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a new method for token embedding compression using Tensor-Train Decomposition.
	2. Demonstrates effectiveness on low-end devices like Raspberry Pi.
	3. Achieves significant energy savings while maintaining performance.

**Result:** The method achieves a compression ratio of around 2.0x for the embedding layer while maintaining comparable language task performance to the original models on a Raspberry Pi.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method significantly reduces energy consumption by half for a single query while preserving language task performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for edge-device applications.

**Abstract:** Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy consumption of a single query drops by half.

**TL;DR:** mixSGA is a novel mixture-of-expert approach that dynamically optimizes computation and memory allocation in causal language modeling by retaining all tokens and adaptively routing them to specialized experts.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Transformer models face scaling issues in causal language modeling due to inefficient memory allocation, particularly with key-value caches, making existing methods inadequate.

**Method:** mixSGA introduces a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism that uses learned importance scores for adaptive resource allocation, alongside weight-sharing across attention projections.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Dynamic token-wise computation and memory allocation
	2. Weight-sharing across grouped attention projections
	3. Auxiliary loss for training-inference consistency

**Result:** mixSGA demonstrates superior performance over static methods, achieving higher ROUGE-L scores and lower perplexity in instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks compared to other model families.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach effectively balances efficiency and performance in causal language modeling, providing a scalable solution without the need to discard low-priority tokens.

**Abstract:** Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling (CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches, which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower perplexity under the same KV budgets.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the ImpliedMeaningPreference dataset and demonstrates that thought-based learning significantly enhances LLMs' pragmatic understanding.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve LLMs' understanding of pragmatics beyond the limitations of annotated labels and to incorporate human-like reasoning in interpreting implicit meanings.

**Method:** The authors introduced a novel dataset that includes explicit reasoning for interpretations and applied preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning on LLMs to enhance performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ImpliedMeaningPreference dataset
	2. Demonstration of thought-based learning enhancing LLM pragmatic understanding
	3. Evidence of significant improvements in accuracy for both general and transfer-learning tasks.

**Result:** The results indicate an 11.12% improvement in pragmatic understanding accuracy across various model families, with a 16.10% improvement in transfer-learning tasks related to pragmatics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Thought-based learning significantly enhances the pragmatic understanding of LLMs, and this methodology shows promise for application in broader tasks within pragmatics.

**Abstract:** Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset, ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics (presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

**Result:** Discovered that word embeddings reflect linguistic shifts related to major events and demonstrate increased positivity in sentiment in recent years.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal a complex relationship between societal events and sentiment, suggesting a nuanced understanding of mental health trends.

**Abstract:** Measuring how semantics of words change over time improves our understanding of how cultures and perspectives change. Diachronic word embeddings help us quantify this shift, although previous studies leveraged substantial temporally annotated corpora. In this work, we use a corpus of 9.5 million Croatian news articles spanning the past 25 years and quantify semantic change using skip-gram word embeddings trained on five-year periods. Our analysis finds that word embeddings capture linguistic shifts of terms pertaining to major topics in this timespan (COVID-19, Croatia joining the European Union, technological advancements). We also find evidence that embeddings from post-2020 encode increased positivity in sentiment analysis tasks, contrasting studies reporting a decline in mental health over the same period.

**Motivation:** To develop a large-scale reasoning model that efficiently handles long inputs and complex tasks, particularly in software engineering environments.

**Method:** Hybrid Mixture-of-Experts architecture with lightning attention mechanism and a novel RL algorithm (CISPO) for training efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. World's first open-weight large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model.
	2. Supports a context length of 1 million tokens, greatly enhancing input handling.
	3. Introduces CISPO, a novel RL algorithm that improves training efficiency.

**Result:** MiniMax-M1 shows comparable or superior performance to existing models like DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B in benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The MiniMax-M1 is a significant advancement in large-scale models for software engineering tasks and is publicly available for further research.

**Abstract:** We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

**Conclusion:** CAMS establishes a new paradigm in human mobility simulation by integrating agentic frameworks with LLMs capable of urban knowledge.

**Abstract:** Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered \textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation (\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS} comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT, TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO. Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information. Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human mobility simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for systematic disease-symptom datasets for medical research, diagnostic accuracy, and AI-driven health management, especially in underrepresented languages.

**Method:** The dataset was compiled by analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports, with a binary structure indicating symptom presence or absence for various diseases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Compilation of disease-symptom relationships from verified medical sources.
	2. Structured dataset format for ease of use in ML applications.
	3. Focus on the Bangla language to promote multilingual health informatics.

**Result:** The structured dataset offers valuable insights for machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies, while addressing the lack of such resources in the Bangla language.

**Limitations:** The dataset may not cover region-specific diseases extensively and requires further refinement for improved diagnostic performance.

**Conclusion:** This dataset enhances the potential for multilingual medical informatics tools and can improve disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities.

**Abstract:** Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research, disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature, and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

**Motivation:** To assess and improve LLMs' ability to perform Theory-of-Mind reasoning in complex narratives, as current models struggle with this cognitive skill critical for understanding character evolution.

**Method:** Constructed LitCharToM, a benchmark with character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions, and introduced EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware temporal knowledge graph representing character psychological development over narratives.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LitCharToM as a benchmark for ToM reasoning in narratives
	2. Development of EvolvTrip, a temporal knowledge graph for tracking character development
	3. Demonstration of improved LLM performance in complex narratives with the proposed methods.

**Result:** EvolvTrip enhances LLM performance, especially for smaller models, in extended-context scenarios, bridging gaps with larger models and improving comprehension in lengthy narratives.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Explicit representation of temporal character mental states is crucial for narrative comprehension, laying groundwork for better character understanding in AI.

**Abstract:** A compelling portrayal of characters is essential to the success of narrative writing. For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs' ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models, partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great compatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of explicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative comprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character understanding. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/EvolvTrip.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve upon the limitations of standard Prefix-Tuning in training modern large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks.

**Method:** The authors introduce Prefix-Tuning+, which generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head, thus enhancing its effectiveness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Prefix-Tuning+ architecture
	2. Demonstration of improved performance compared to traditional Prefix-Tuning
	3. Comparison with LoRA method showing competitive results

**Result:** Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods and matches the performance of the LoRA method on several general benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that with the advancements made in Prefix-Tuning+, this approach can remain a relevant and competitive option for parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

**Abstract:** Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our construction process to guide future users when constructing their own context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To critically assess the claims made in a prior paper regarding the effectiveness of the min-p sampling method in language model outputs.

**Method:** The study conducts a re-analysis of the original paper's evidence, including human evaluations, NLP benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, and community adoption metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive re-evaluation of min-p sampling method evidence
	2. Identification of methodological flaws in original human evaluations
	3. Clarification on misrepresented community adoption claims

**Result:** Findings indicate that min-p does not surpass baseline samplers in any evaluated aspect, undermining the original claims made about its superiority.

**Limitations:** The re-evaluation is limited to the scope of the original paper’s claims and does not assess other potential language model samplers.

**Conclusion:** The evidence from the original paper does not support the assertion that min-p improves language model output quality, diversity, or any trade-off between the two.

**Abstract:** Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs, affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported. Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

### [156] [Balancing Knowledge Delivery and Emotional Comfort in Healthcare Conversational Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13692)

*Shang-Chi Tsai, Yun-Nung Chen*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** healthcare dialogue, large language models, emotional support, patient queries, medical responses

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how large language models can offer emotional support alongside medical information in healthcare dialogues by modifying an interactive medical dialogue dataset.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for dialogue systems to provide not only informative answers but also emotional comfort during medical consultations.

**Method:** We rewrite a medical dialogue dataset with patient queries reflecting negative emotions and train LLMs to balance knowledge sharing with emotional support through fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a modified interactive medical dialogue dataset for training LLMs
	2. Demonstrated enhanced ability of LLMs to generate emotional responses
	3. Established the importance of balancing knowledge and emotional support in healthcare dialogues

**Result:** Experimental results show our approach significantly improves the model's ability to generate empathetic responses while retaining accurate knowledge.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating emotional reassurance into medical dialogue models provides a more supportive experience for patients.

**Abstract:** With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now capable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical conditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience negative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the model can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's negative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a more reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address this issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and emotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset, generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their concerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models with various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences with both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to patients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental results demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's ability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original capability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Introducing InstABoost, a method to enhance LLM generation control by manipulating model attention.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the effectiveness of latent steering in large language models, which has shown to be limited compared to simple instruction prompting.

**Method:** InstABoost alters model attention during generation to strengthen instruction prompting, theoretically supported by prior work on in-context rule following in transformer models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost) method
	2. Establishment of a benchmark for evaluating steering techniques
	3. Demonstration of InstABoost's superior performance over existing methods

**Result:** InstABoost shows superior control success when compared to traditional prompting and existing latent steering techniques.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new method effectively enhances the generation control of LLMs, making them safer and more reliable for deployment.

**Abstract:** Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a dynamic query routing approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leveraging both heuristics and learned models to improve performance across different query types.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current RAG systems often use a single, fixed retriever, which may not perform well across all query types.

**Method:** The approach frames query routing as a learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduces the LTRR framework that learns to rank retrievers based on expected utility gain for downstream LLM performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dynamic query routing framework (LTRR) for RAG systems.
	2. Demonstrated performance improvements over traditional single-retriever systems.
	3. Provided insights into the impact of training metrics on downstream performance.

**Result:** Experiments indicate that routing-based RAG systems outperform single-retriever systems, especially for models trained with the Answer Correctness metric and pairwise learning methods like XGBoost, leading to better generalization to out-of-distribution queries.

**Limitations:** Limited to the performance evaluation in controlled synthetic QA settings and might require further validation on real-world data.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the importance of training methodologies and metric selection in enhancing query routing effectiveness in RAG systems.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed retriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally across all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that dynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both train-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to rank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance. Our experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type variations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best single-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in models trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise learning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in generalization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of our approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and faithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training methodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, reasoning length, budget guidance, token efficiency, emergent capabilities

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes 'budget guidance', a method for steering reasoning length in large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning, aiming to control inference costs while maintaining performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Controlling reasoning length in large language models is important to minimize inference costs, especially under tight reasoning budgets, without compromising performance.

**Method:** The method introduces a lightweight predictor that models a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation, guiding token-level generation to adhere to a specified thinking budget.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a method for controlling reasoning length in LLMs without fine-tuning.
	2. Achieves significant token efficiency improvements on math benchmarks.
	3. Demonstrates generalization to broader task domains and emergent capabilities.

**Result:** Budget guidance achieves up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark while using only 63% of the tokens compared to baseline models, maintaining competitive accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach generalizes to various tasks, improves token efficiency, and exhibits emergent capabilities like estimating question difficulty.

**Abstract:** Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains. Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as estimating question difficulty.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the practical challenges posed by the large size and high inference costs of transformer-based models in speech processing, making them less viable for real-world applications.

**Method:** The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of four common compression methods: weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers, using three key metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques on speech models.

**Result:** The results indicate that each compression method has unique advantages, enabling better understanding of their effectiveness in reducing model size and inference costs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper provides a comparative analysis of recent compression techniques under a unified evaluation framework to guide practical deployment of speech Transformer models.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based self-supervised models have achieved remarkable success in speech processing, but their large size and high inference cost present significant challenges for real-world deployment. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed, inconsistent evaluation metrics make it difficult to compare their practical effectiveness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of four common compression methods, including weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers. We evaluate each method under three key metrics: parameter count, multiply-accumulate operations, and real-time factor. Results show that each method offers distinct advantages. In addition, we contextualize recent compression techniques, comparing DistilHuBERT, FitHuBERT, LightHuBERT, ARMHuBERT, and STaRHuBERT under the same framework, offering practical guidance on compression for deployment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The effectiveness of Smurfs and its components is confirmed through extensive studies, providing valuable insights for future multi-agent system design.

**Abstract:** Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools for solving complex problems can grant them human-like reasoning abilities. ReAct and its variants are popular frameworks for tool use in both single-agent and multi-agent systems. To address issues like error propagation and limited exploration in ReAct, the Deep First Search Decision Tree (DFSDT) was proposed, but it faces challenges such as rollback instability, redundant context, and premature termination in single-agent settings. We introduce "Smurfs," a novel multi-agent system (MAS) that enhances DFSDT with a modular, context-efficient, and training-free design. Smurfs surpasses baseline methods in both the open-ended StableToolBench and the closed-ended HotpotQA tasks, reducing token usage by 60.9\% compared to DFSDT and enabling Mistral-7b to perform on par with GPT-4-DFSDT. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of Smurfs' core components, offering valuable insights for the construction and interpretation of MAS, and paving the way for future exploration.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The limited set of domain-salient APIs in existing embodied simulators necessitates an exploration of more versatile APIs for AI agents operating in physical environments.

**Method:** The authors propose a framework that utilizes a few-shot prompting approach with GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs for agent policies and induce a wide range of APIs by reusing a seed set and fabricating new ones as needed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed framework for inducing APIs from wikiHow instructions.
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline in generating a rich action space.
	3. Identified the gap between the needed APIs and those supported by existing simulators.

**Result:** A total of 300+ APIs were induced from a small fraction (0.5%) of wikiHow tutorials, revealing that current simulators only support a minor subset of these induced APIs, highlighting the need for action-rich environments.

**Limitations:** The focus is on defining APIs rather than their executability, which may limit practical application.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of defining a broader set of APIs for embodied agents to enhance their capabilities in completing diverse tasks efficiently.

**Abstract:** AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actions or affordances that are accessed via API calls. While deploying AI agents in the real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodied simulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs. This naturally brings up the questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatile embodied agent, and what should they look like? We explore this via a thought experiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety of human-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover these instructions? We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs by grounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies. Inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose a few-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agent policies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; and then 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary. The focus of this thought experiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability. We apply the proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials. On a small fraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessary for capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world. A detailed automatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposed pipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs. Moreover, a manual review revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of the induced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development of action-rich embodied environments.

**Result:** FnF-TG demonstrates superior performance on popular datasets compared to existing methods, particularly in fully inductive settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The model offers a fast and cost-effective solution for link prediction and introduces new evaluation datasets for assessing performance on unseen relations.

**Abstract:** We propose Fast-and-Frugal Text-Graph (FnF-TG) Transformers, a Transformer-based framework that unifies textual and structural information for inductive link prediction in text-attributed knowledge graphs. We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don't rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new test-bench for fully inductive link prediction.

**Conclusion:** Highlights the effectiveness of adversarial learning in legal AI and suggests expanding simulation-based legal reasoning to broader contexts.

**Abstract:** Current research in LLM-based simulation systems lacks comprehensive solutions for modeling real-world court proceedings, while existing legal language models struggle with dynamic courtroom interactions. We present AgentCourt, a comprehensive legal simulation framework that addresses these challenges through adversarial evolution of LLM-based agents. Our AgentCourt introduces a new adversarial evolutionary approach for agents called AdvEvol, which performs dynamic knowledge learning and evolution through structured adversarial interactions in a simulated courtroom program, breaking the limitations of the traditional reliance on static knowledge bases or manual annotations. By simulating 1,000 civil cases, we construct an evolving knowledge base that enhances the agents' legal reasoning abilities. The evolved lawyer agents demonstrated outstanding performance on our newly introduced CourtBench benchmark, achieving a 12.1% improvement in performance compared to the original lawyer agents. Evaluations by professional lawyers confirm the effectiveness of our approach across three critical dimensions: cognitive agility, professional knowledge, and logical rigor. Beyond outperforming specialized legal models in interactive reasoning tasks, our findings emphasize the importance of adversarial learning in legal AI and suggest promising directions for extending simulation-based legal reasoning to broader judicial and regulatory contexts.

**Motivation:** To create emotionally intelligent conversational systems that provide effective support to users in distress, addressing the biases of LLMs in strategy selection and enhancing transparency in decision-making processes.

**Method:** EmoDynamiX employs a heterogeneous graph model that captures the relationship between user emotions and system strategies, separating the generation of dialogue from the strategies themselves.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of EmoDynamiX framework for emotional dialogue strategy prediction
	2. Decoupling of strategy prediction from language generation
	3. Improved performance metrics in emotional support dialogues with enhanced transparency

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that EmoDynamiX significantly outperforms existing methods on two emotional support conversation datasets, demonstrating enhanced proficiency and reduced bias in emotional strategy preference.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** EmoDynamiX improves both the performance of emotional support interactions and the transparency of decision-making in dialogue systems, providing a framework that can be effectively applied to enhance user experiences in conversational agents.

**Abstract:** Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.

**Result:** Results show significant efficiency and performance improvements in generating clinical notes compared to standard LLM fine-tuning methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research contributes a valuable dataset and an effective methodology for clinical note generation, promoting better time management for healthcare professionals.

**Abstract:** Writing clinical notes and documenting medical exams is a critical task for healthcare professionals, serving as a vital component of patient care documentation. However, manually writing these notes is time-consuming and can impact the amount of time clinicians can spend on direct patient interaction and other tasks. Consequently, the development of automated clinical note generation systems has emerged as a clinically meaningful area of research within AI for health. In this paper, we present three key contributions to the field of clinical note generation using large language models (LLMs). First, we introduce CliniKnote, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 1,200 complex doctor-patient conversations paired with their full clinical notes. This dataset, created and curated by medical experts with the help of modern neural networks, provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating models in clinical note generation tasks. Second, we propose the K-SOAP (Keyword, Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) note format, which enhances traditional SOAP~\cite{podder2023soap} (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes by adding a keyword section at the top, allowing for quick identification of essential information. Third, we develop an automatic pipeline to generate K-SOAP notes from doctor-patient conversations and benchmark various modern LLMs using various metrics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and performance compared to standard LLM finetuning methods.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper addresses the limitations of pretrained language models in learning factual knowledge during finetuning. It proposes strategies to enhance learning of factual associations over co-occurrence statistics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Pretrained language models struggle to learn new factual knowledge due to a bias towards word co-occurrence statistics rather than true factual associations.

**Method:** The study identifies distinct representations of knowledge in language models and proposes two strategies: training on text with implicit factual associations and a method to forget co-occurrence statistics to enhance factual learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of knowledge representation differences in language models
	2. Two training strategies to improve learning of factual associations
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness on various reasoning tasks

**Result:** The proposed strategies significantly improve the generalization of knowledge learned during finetuning, particularly in indirect and multi-hop question answering tasks, tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that adjusting the training approach can help language models better learn and generalize factual knowledge.

**Abstract:** Pretrained language models can encode a large amount of knowledge and utilize it for various reasoning tasks, yet they can still struggle to learn novel factual knowledge effectively from finetuning on limited textual demonstrations. In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is that language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead of true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of knowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of co-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer model and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple question answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower layers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these observations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual associations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit rather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual associations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the generalization of newly learned knowledge. We also propose a simple training method to actively forget the learned co-occurrence statistics, which unblocks and enhances the learning of factual associations when training on plain narrative text. On both synthetic and real-world corpora, the two proposed strategies improve the generalization of the knowledge learned during finetuning to reasoning scenarios such as indirect and multi-hop question answering.

**Result:** The proposed strategy achieved state-of-the-art average performance across 15x14 language pairs, requiring less than 10 hours of speech data per language to attain competitive outcomes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach demonstrates the potential of MLLMs in improving translation performance in low-resource scenarios while also providing open-source resources for further research.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) tasks. While most existing research has focused on English-centric translation directions, the exploration of many-to-many translation is still limited by the scarcity of parallel data. To address this, we propose a three-stage curriculum learning strategy that leverages the machine translation capabilities of large language models and adapts them to S2TT tasks, enabling effective learning in low-resource settings. We trained MLLMs with varying parameter sizes (3B, 7B, and 32B) and evaluated the proposed strategy using the FLEURS and CoVoST-2 datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy achieves state-of-the-art average performance in $15\times14$ language pairs, requiring fewer than 10 hours of speech data per language to achieve competitive results.

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the relationship between high-precision computations and low-precision quantization in LLMs, introducing key metrics and proposing a scaling law for post-training quantization.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine how much high-precision computation must be preserved when quantizing LLMs for target accuracy or perplexity.

**Method:** Introduces metrics quantization ratio and quantization block size; conducted controlled experiments across models and quantization methods to derive a scaling law.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces quantization ratio and block size metrics for evaluating LLM quantization.
	2. Establishes a unified scaling law predicting loss degeneration with varying quantization parameters.
	3. Provides insights on mixed quantization adoption for larger models.

**Result:** Demonstrates a multiplicative relationship between parameter scaling and quantization ratio, indicating that larger models can tolerate higher quantization ratios and mixed quantization is viable.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A small quantization block size is not necessary for large models and complicating hardware design can be avoided by adjusting this parameter effectively.

**Abstract:** Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective in reducing the memory and computational requirements for inference. In this study, we focus on a straightforward question: When aiming for a target accuracy or perplexity with low-precision quantization, how much high-precision computation needs to be preserved and how fine-grained this quantization would need to be as we scale LLMs to larger sizes? We first introduce two critical metrics named the quantization ratio ($Q_r$) and quantization block size ($Q_b$). The former measures the number of parameters quantized to low-precision arithmetic normalized by the total parameter count, whereas the latter defines the number of values within a block that share a scaling factor, akin to the block size concept introduced in the FP4 format in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments across different model and quantization methods, we propose a unified scaling law on post-training quantization (PTQ) that can predict loss degeneration for varying $Q_r$ and $Q_b$. For $Q_r$, our scaling law implies that parameter scaling and ratio scaling have a multiplicative relationship. Consequently, larger models are more amenable to a higher quantization ratio $Q_r$, thus supporting an increase in the adoption of mixed quantization for inference. Regarding $Q_b$, our findings indicate that a small block size, similar to that used in Blackwell, is not essential for large models. Employing a small $Q_b$ can instead unnecessarily complicate the design of the hardware circuit.

**Conclusion:** The findings provide valuable insights and best practices for leveraging upcycling in building effective MoE language models, highlighting the advantages of particular routing methods and granularity levels.

**Abstract:** Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. We propose a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, we find that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, we show that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, we upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. Our results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models. Code is available.

**Motivation:** To address the quantization errors caused by outliers in large language models and improve compression and acceleration efficiency.

**Method:** FlatQuant applies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer using a lightweight objective and integrates operations through a single kernel, utilizing the Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices to reduce overhead.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** FlatQuant demonstrates that improved flatness of weights and activations can significantly enhance the performance of quantization in large language models while maintaining efficiency.

**Abstract:** Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than 1\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and 1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at: https://github.com/ruikangliu/FlatQuant.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inaccuracies of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling numerical data in tables for the TableQA task, which has been overlooked in recent studies.

**Method:** TabLaP uses LLMs as planners for multi-step reasoning and offloads numerical calculations to a Python interpreter.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a model that leverages LLMs for planning and a Python interpreter for calculations.
	2. Quantifies trustworthiness of answers to enhance user confidence.
	3. Improves accuracy on benchmark datasets, demonstrating practical applications in TableQA.

**Result:** TabLaP demonstrated substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art models, enhancing answer accuracy by 5.7% and 5.8% on two benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach not only improves accuracy but also allows users to evaluate the trustworthiness of the answers, enabling regret-aware usage of the model.

**Abstract:** Question answering on free-form tables (a.k.a. TableQA) is a challenging task because of the flexible structure and complex schema of tables. Recent studies use Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, exploiting their capability in understanding the questions and tabular data, which are typically given in natural language and contain many textual fields, respectively. While this approach has shown promising results, it overlooks the challenges brought by numerical values which are common in tabular data, and LLMs are known to struggle with such values. We aim to address this issue, and we propose a model named TabLaP that uses LLMs as a planner rather than an answer generator. This approach exploits LLMs' capability in multi-step reasoning while leaving the actual numerical calculations to a Python interpreter for accurate calculation. Recognizing the inaccurate nature of LLMs, we further make a first attempt to quantify the trustworthiness of the answers produced by TabLaP, such that users can use TabLaP in a regret-aware manner. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that TabLaP is substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art models, improving the answer accuracy by 5.7% and 5.8% on the two datasets, respectively.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, safety, usefulness, finetuning, alignment

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the trade-off between safety and usefulness in large language models and introduces a new finetuning strategy called POROver to optimize this balance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rapid development of large language models has made it essential to ensure they are both safe and useful, as current models often exhibit unsafe behaviors or excessive caution, leading to overrefusals of benign prompts.

**Method:** The study examines the effects of overgenerating finetuning data using advanced teacher models on instruction-following language models and presents the POROver strategy that utilizes preference optimization to mitigate overrefusals while retaining safety.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the POROver alignment strategy for language models.
	2. Demonstrates the effectiveness of overgenerating finetuning data through advanced teacher models.
	3. Provides data and code to replicate findings, enhancing the research community's ability to explore this area.

**Result:** Overgenerating data for general-purpose prompts improved safety significantly from a baseline F1 score of 74.4% to 91.8%, with minimal impact on usefulness. Toxic prompt overgeneration increased usefulness from 11.1% to 57.6%, and the application of POROver further enhanced usefulness to 82.1% while maintaining safety levels.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that strategic finetuning with overgenerating data and the POROver alignment technique can effectively improve the balance between safety and usefulness in language models.

**Abstract:** Achieving both high safety and high usefulness simultaneously in large language models has become a critical challenge in recent years.Models often exhibit unsafe behavior or adopt an overly cautious approach leading to frequent overrefusal of benign prompts, which reduces their usefulness. A major factor underlying these behaviors is how the models are finetuned and aligned, particularly the nature and extent of the data used.In this work, we examine how overgenerating finetuning data with advanced teacher models (e.g., GPT-4o)-covering both general-purpose and toxic prompts-affects safety and usefulness in instruction-following language models.Additionally, we present POROver, an alignment strategy designed for models that are highly safe but prone to overrefusal. POROver employs preference optimization algorithms and leverages completions from an advanced teacher model to reduce overrefusals while maintaining safety.Our results show that overgenerating completions for general-purpose prompts significantly boosts safety with only a minimal impact on usefulness. Specifically, the F1 score calculated between safety and usefulness increases from 74.4% to 91.8% because of a substantial rise in safety. Moreover, overgeneration for toxic prompts raises usefulness from 11.1% to 57.6% while preserving safety. Finally, applying POROVer increases usefulness further-from 57.6% to 82.1%-while keeping safety at comparable levels. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/batuhankmkaraman/POROver.

**Motivation:** Current LLMs in medicine are limited to text-based interaction, which restricts their effectiveness in diverse clinical scenarios. There's a need for a comprehensive benchmark and a tool that can overcome these limitations.

**Method:** The paper proposes a benchmark consisting of 18 tasks across five clinical dimensions and introduces ReflecTool, which employs a two-stage optimization process to enhance long-term memory and tool selection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ClinicalAgent Bench (CAB) for holistic evaluation of clinical agents.
	2. Development of ReflecTool that utilizes a two-stage approach for tool selection and memory optimization.
	3. Demonstration of substantial performance improvements over existing LLMs and agent-based methods.

**Result:** Experiments show that ReflecTool outperforms both pure LLMs and established agent-based methods in solving complex clinical tasks by significant margins.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ReflecTool proves to be a highly effective framework for improving the adaptability and performance of clinical agents in challenging environments.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in the medical domain, assisting with tasks like clinical note generation and patient communication. However, current LLMs are limited to text-based communication, hindering their ability to interact with diverse forms of information in clinical environments. Despite clinical agents succeeding in diverse signal interaction, they are oriented to a single clinical scenario and hence fail for broader applications. To evaluate clinical agents holistically, we propose ClinicalAgent Bench~(CAB), a comprehensive medical agent benchmark consisting of 18 tasks across five key realistic clinical dimensions. Building on this, we introduce ReflecTool, a novel framework that excels at utilizing domain-specific tools within two stages. The first optimization stage progressively enlarges a long-term memory by saving successful solving processes and tool-wise experience of agents in a tiny pre-defined training set. In the following inference stage, ReflecTool can search for supportive successful demonstrations from already built long-term memory to guide the tool selection strategy, and a verifier improves the tool usage according to the tool-wise experience with two verification methods--iterative refinement and candidate selection. Extensive experiments on ClinicalAgent Benchmark demonstrate that ReflecTool surpasses the pure LLMs with more than 10 points and the well-established agent-based methods with 3 points, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness in solving complex clinical tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate how LLMs reason about Newcomb-like problems that involve agent interactions and decision theory.

**Method:** Creation of a dataset containing capability and attitude questions, followed by analysis of various models on this dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new dataset for Newcomb-like problems
	2. Analysis of LLM attitudes and capabilities
	3. Insights into the relationship between decision theory attitudes and model capabilities.

**Result:** Findings indicate significant variation in attitudes among models, with higher capabilities linked to more favorable attitudes towards evidential decision theory.

**Limitations:** Dataset may not cover the full spectrum of decision scenarios; results may be model-specific.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of understanding model attitudes to enhance cooperation in LLM-based agent interactions.

**Abstract:** We introduce a dataset of natural-language questions in the decision theory of so-called Newcomb-like problems. Newcomb-like problems include, for instance, decision problems in which an agent interacts with a similar other agent, and thus has to reason about the fact that the other agent will likely reason in similar ways. Evaluating LLM reasoning about Newcomb-like problems is important because interactions between foundation-model-based agents will often be Newcomb-like. Some ways of reasoning about Newcomb-like problems may allow for greater cooperation between models.   Our dataset contains both capabilities questions (i.e., questions with a unique, uncontroversially correct answer) and attitude questions (i.e., questions about which decision theorists would disagree). We use our dataset for an investigation of decision-theoretical capabilities and expressed attitudes and their interplay in existing models (different models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, GDM, Reka, etc.), as well as models under simple prompt-based interventions. We find, among other things, that attitudes vary significantly between existing models; that high capabilities are associated with attitudes more favorable toward so-called evidential decision theory; and that attitudes are consistent across different types of questions.

**Motivation:** The proposed work addresses the gap between documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those needed by the generator in Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.

**Method:** The framework includes a rationale extraction method that utilizes LLMs to identify key rationales for query responses, followed by a rationale-based reranking and fine-tuning process for aligning the reranker's and generator's preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RADIO framework for preference alignment
	2. Use of rationale extraction from Large Language Models
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness through comprehensive experiments

**Result:** Extensive experiments across two tasks and three datasets show that RADIO outperforms baseline methods in aligning preferences between reranking and generation components.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RADIO effectively reduces the gap between document relevance judgment and query response requirements, enhancing the overall efficiency of RAG models.

**Abstract:** The reranker and generator are two critical components in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (i.e., RAG) pipeline, responsible for ranking relevant documents and generating responses. However, due to differences in pre-training data and objectives, there is an inevitable gap between the documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those required by the generator to support answering the query. To address this gap, we propose RADIO, a novel and practical preference alignment framework with RAtionale DIstillatiOn. Specifically, we first propose a rationale extraction method that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the rationales necessary for answering the query. Subsequently, a rationale-based alignment process is designed to rerank the documents based on the extracted rationales, and fine-tune the reranker to align the preferences. We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks across three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to baseline methods. Our code is released online to ease reproduction.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of CoT-based Synthesizer offers a feasible way to improve inference accuracy in LLMs, even when all candidates are incorrect, and supports smaller models using generated training data.

**Abstract:** Current inference scaling methods, such as Self-consistency and Best-of-N, have proven effective in improving the accuracy of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on the quality of candidate responses and are unable to produce correct answers when all candidates are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel inference scaling strategy, CoT-based Synthesizer, which leverages CoT reasoning to synthesize superior answers by analyzing complementary information from multiple candidate responses, even when all candidate responses are flawed. To enable a lightweight and cost-effective implementation, we introduce an automated data generation pipeline that creates diverse training data. This allows smaller LLMs trained on this data to improve the inference accuracy of larger models, including API-based LLMs. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets with seven policy models demonstrate that our method significantly enhances performance, with gains of 11.8% for Llama3-8B and 10.3% for GPT-4o on the MATH dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the increasing reliance on LLMs for cultural heritage tasks and the associated risks of cultural value misalignments in generated texts.

**Method:** The study systematically evaluates 5 open-source LLMs using 1066 query tasks across 5 categories and 17 aspects of cultural heritage, applying both automated and manual approaches to detect misalignments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic assessment of LLMs for cultural heritage tasks
	2. Identification of significant cultural value misalignments in LLM outputs
	3. Introduction of a benchmark dataset and evaluation workflow for enhancing cultural sensitivity of LLMs.

**Result:** Over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with some tasks showing nearly complete misalignment with key cultural values.

**Limitations:** Focuses on 5 open-source LLMs and may not generalize to all LLMs or cultural contexts.

**Conclusion:** The paper introduces a benchmark dataset and comprehensive evaluation workflow for future research on enhancing LLMs' cultural sensitivity and reliability.

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in tasks related to cultural heritage, such as generating descriptions of historical monuments, translating ancient texts, preserving oral traditions, and creating educational content, their ability to produce accurate and culturally aligned texts is being increasingly relied upon by users and researchers. However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts. Using both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze the cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are concerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment with key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a valuable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural sensitivity and reliability of LLMs.

**Result:** RoPE achieves similar or improved ASR error rates compared to RelPos and reduces training time by up to 21%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RoPE is shown to be a viable alternative for ASR, enabling efficient attention without compromising performance.

**Abstract:** Self-attention relies on positional embeddings to encode input order. Relative Position (RelPos) embeddings are widely used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, RelPos has quadratic time complexity to input length and is often incompatible with fast GPU implementations of attention. In contrast, Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) rotates each input vector based on its absolute position, taking linear time to sequence length, implicitly encoding relative distances through self-attention dot products. Thus, it is usually compatible with efficient attention. However, its use in ASR remains underexplored. This work evaluates RoPE across diverse ASR tasks with training data ranging from 100 to 50,000 hours, covering various speech types (read, spontaneous, clean, noisy) and different accents in both streaming and non-streaming settings. ASR error rates are similar or better than RelPos, while training time is reduced by up to 21%. Code is available via the SpeechBrain toolkit.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Careful hyperparameter selection can lead to more efficient model development and reduced data annotation costs. TAMA outperforms existing models on table tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection. We open-source the project and our models.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenges of financial reasoning for LLMs due to lack of effective data, empirical studies, and benchmarks.

**Method:** A novel three-stage pipeline for corpus generation using domain supervision, iterative LLM refinement, and difficulty-aware filtering, along with the development of financial reasoning models using supervised fine-tuning and RL.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FinCoT, a comprehensive financial CoT corpus.
	2. Development of Fin-o1, a novel financial reasoning model with improved performance over existing models.
	3. Creation of the FinReason benchmark for evaluating financial reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

**Result:** Fin-o1 outperforms existing financial reasoning models and state-of-the-art general models, while GRPO method shows reliable gains compared to other RL methods.

**Limitations:** Focus on financial reasoning; might not generalize to other domains.

**Conclusion:** The results imply the importance of targeted data and optimization strategies for improving financial reasoning abilities in LLMs, rather than relying solely on model size.

**Abstract:** As the fundamental capability behind decision-making in finance, financial reasoning poses distinct challenges for LLMs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) have boosted generic reasoning, the progress in finance is hindered by the absence of empirical study of building effective financial chain-of-thought (CoT) corpus, a systematic comparison of different RL methods, and comprehensive benchmarks. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCoT, the first open high-fidelity CoT corpus for finance, distilled from seven QA datasets by a novel three-stage pipeline that incorporates domain supervision, iterative LLM refinement, and difficulty-aware filtering. Based on FinCoT, we develop Fin-o1, the first open financial reasoning models trained via supervised fine-tuning and GRPO-based RL. Our models outperform existing financial reasoning models and SOTA general models such as GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.5. We also investigate the effectiveness of three different RL methods in improving domain-specific reasoning, offering the first such empirical study. We finally propose FinReason, the first financial reasoning benchmark covering multi-table analysis, long-context reasoning, and equation-based tasks, and evaluate 29 LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal general reasoning models excel on standard benchmarks yet exhibit obvious performance degradation in financial contexts; even finance-tuned models like Dianjin-R1 and FinR1 degrade on lengthy documents. In contrast, our Fin-o1 models consistently outperform their backbones and larger GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, confirming the effectiveness of our data building and model training strategy. Our study further shows that GRPO yields reliable gains whereas PPO and DPO do not, highlighting the need for targeted data and optimisation rather than scale alone.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a benchmark for evaluating LLM truthfulness in Basque, Catalan, Galician, and Spanish, revealing insights about multilingual performance.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the truthfulness of large language models across non-English languages, which have been less studied compared to English evaluations.

**Method:** Evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs through human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and the LLM-as-a-Judge scoring method.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multilingual truthfulness evaluation benchmark for LLMs.
	2. Insights into the performance differences of LLMs across languages.
	3. Demonstration of LLM-as-a-Judge's effectiveness in correlating with human evaluations.

**Result:** LLMs show better performance in English and the lowest in Basque, but discrepancies in truthfulness across languages are smaller than expected. LLM-as-a-Judge aligns closely with human judgments, and informativeness affects truthfulness assessments.

**Limitations:** Focusing on only 12 models may limit the generalizability of findings to all LLMs; primarily addresses LLMs in four specific languages.

**Conclusion:** Machine translation can effectively extend truthfulness benchmarks, and evaluations should consider cultural and temporal factors.

**Abstract:** We introduce a professionally translated extension of the TruthfulQA benchmark designed to evaluate truthfulness in Basque, Catalan, Galician, and Spanish. Truthfulness evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have primarily been conducted in English. However, the ability of LLMs to maintain truthfulness across languages remains under-explored. Our study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs, comparing base and instruction-tuned models using human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque (the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across languages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that LLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than multiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in truthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation provides a viable approach for extending truthfulness benchmarks to additional languages, offering a scalable alternative to professional translation. Finally, we observe that universal knowledge questions are better handled across languages than context- and time-dependent ones, highlighting the need for truthfulness evaluations that account for cultural and temporal variability. Dataset and code are publicly available under open licenses.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** automatic speech recognition, language model, unidirectional training, bidirectional training, MTLM

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper presents MTLM, a new training paradigm that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional methods for language models in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, improving performance and flexibility.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Traditional ASR language models are limited by their unidirectional training approach, which does not utilize right-side context, hindering their representational capability.

**Method:** MTLM employs three training objectives (ULM, BMLM, UMLM) to unify unidirectional and bidirectional training, enhancing the language model's ability to capture linguistic patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MTLM, a unified training paradigm for ASR language models
	2. Demonstrates improved performance on the LibriSpeech dataset
	3. Supports multiple decoding strategies for ASR

**Result:** Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset indicate that MTLM outperforms traditional unidirectional training across various decoding strategies in ASR applications.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address potential computational overhead introduced by the new training paradigm.

**Conclusion:** MTLM enhances ASR performance and supports multiple decoding strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems normally consist of an acoustic model (AM) and a language model (LM). The acoustic model estimates the probability distribution of text given the input speech, while the language model calibrates this distribution toward a specific knowledge domain to produce the final transcription. Traditional ASR-specific LMs are typically trained in a unidirectional (left-to-right) manner to align with autoregressive decoding. However, this restricts the model from leveraging the right-side context during training, limiting its representational capacity. In this work, we propose MTLM, a novel training paradigm that unifies unidirectional and bidirectional manners through 3 training objectives: ULM, BMLM, and UMLM. This approach enhances the LM's ability to capture richer linguistic patterns from both left and right contexts while preserving compatibility with standard ASR autoregressive decoding methods. As a result, the MTLM model not only enhances the ASR system's performance but also support multiple decoding strategies, including shallow fusion, unidirectional/bidirectional n-best rescoring. Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset show that MTLM consistently outperforms unidirectional training across multiple decoding strategies, highlighting its effectiveness and flexibility in ASR applications.

**Result:** CMCTS outperforms a 72B parameter model with a 7B parameter model achieving an average accuracy of 83.4% across mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The CMCTS framework provides an effective approach to improving LLM reasoning capabilities and offers insights for future tasks, with theoretical support and experimental validation.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (CMCTS) framework to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). By incorporating a constrained action space, Process Reward Model (PRM), and partial order rules, CMCTS effectively addresses the limitations of existing MCTS methods in terms of state space diversity and action selection rationality. Specifically, during the expansion phase, CMCTS restricts action sampling to a predefined constrained action set to increase candidate state diversity. In the simulation phase, it introduces partial order rules and PRM to optimize action selection and prevent unreasonable state transitions. Experimental results show that CMCTS performs outstandingly across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Under a zero-shot setting, a 7B-parameter model achieves an average accuracy of 83.4\%, surpassing the 72B baseline model by 4.8\%. Ablation studies demonstrate that each component of the framework is crucial for performance improvement, and their combined use fully leverages their respective strengths. Overall, the CMCTS framework provides an effective approach to enhancing LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities, supported by theoretical analysis, and offers novel insights for future reasoning tasks.

**Motivation:** To understand the unique output patterns in LLMs that can help in distinguishing between different models based on their text generation.

**Method:** A classification task was set up where the goal was to predict the source LLM for a given text output. The authors fine-tuned text embedding models on LLM-generated texts and evaluated classifications across multiple LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification and analysis of idiosyncrasies in LLM outputs.
	2. Development of a classification method achieving high accuracy in model distinction.

**Result:** Achieved 97.1% accuracy in distinguishing outputs from ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek by leveraging unique idiosyncrasies in word-level distributions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Idiosyncratic patterns are encoded in the semantic content and persist across various transformations of the text. The findings have implications for training models, evaluating LLMs, and inferring model similarities.

**Abstract:** In this work, we unveil and study idiosyncrasies in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- unique patterns in their outputs that can be used to distinguish the models. To do so, we consider a simple classification task: given a particular text output, the objective is to predict the source LLM that generates the text. We evaluate this synthetic task across various groups of LLMs and find that simply fine-tuning text embedding models on LLM-generated texts yields excellent classification accuracy. Notably, we achieve 97.1% accuracy on held-out validation data in the five-way classification problem involving ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our further investigation reveals that these idiosyncrasies are rooted in word-level distributions. These patterns persist even when the texts are rewritten, translated, or summarized by an external LLM, suggesting that they are also encoded in the semantic content. Additionally, we leverage LLM as judges to generate detailed, open-ended descriptions of each model's idiosyncrasies. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings, including training on synthetic data, inferring model similarity, and robust evaluation of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llm-idiosyncrasies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework shows promise for improving clinical decision-making by providing richer insights from the combination of temporal and textual data.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a framework for identifying and regularizing unintended features in LLM latent spaces to improve the generalizability and fairness of text classification models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Text classification methods using LLMs face challenges in feature interpretability and the inability to remove unintended features, which can affect model compliance and generalizability.

**Method:** The authors pre-train a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to extract features from LLM latent spaces and fine-tune it with task-specific datasets. They then introduce a regularizer that minimizes the similarity between classifier weights and identified unintended features during classification training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a framework for feature regularization in LLM latent spaces.
	2. Introduction of a sparse autoencoder for feature interpretation.
	3. Evaluation on real-world tasks showing improved model generalizability.

**Result:** The proposed framework enhances classifier generalizability across toxic chat detection, reward modeling, and disease diagnosis tasks by regularizing features unrelated to the task.

**Limitations:** The framework’s effectiveness may depend on the quality and diversity of the task-specific datasets used for fine-tuning the SAE.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates a pioneering approach to controllable text classification using interpreted features from LLMs to address challenges related to fairness and privacy.

**Abstract:** Modern text classification methods heavily rely on contextual embeddings from large language models (LLMs). Compared to human-engineered features, these embeddings provide automatic and effective representations for classification model training. However, they also introduce a challenge: we lose the ability to manually remove unintended features, such as sensitive or task-irrelevant features, to guarantee regulatory compliance or improve the generalizability of classification models. This limitation arises because LLM embeddings are opaque and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to identify and regularize unintended features in the LLM latent space. Specifically, we first pre-train a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to extract interpretable features from LLM latent spaces. To ensure the SAE can capture task-specific features, we further fine-tune it on task-specific datasets. In training the classification model, we propose a simple and effective regularizer, by minimizing the similarity between the classifier weights and the identified unintended feature, to remove the impact of these unintended features on classification. We evaluate the proposed framework on three real-world tasks, including toxic chat detection, reward modeling, and disease diagnosis. Results show that the proposed self-regularization framework can improve the classifier's generalizability by regularizing those features that are not semantically correlated to the task. This work pioneers controllable text classification on LLM latent spaces by leveraging interpreted features to address generalizability, fairness, and privacy challenges.

**Conclusion:** The dataset contributes significantly to the understanding of entity framing in news, offering a new tool for researchers in news analysis and related fields.

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel multilingual hierarchical corpus annotated for entity framing and role portrayal in news articles. The dataset uses a unique taxonomy inspired by storytelling elements, comprising 22 fine-grained roles, or archetypes, nested within three main categories: protagonist, antagonist, and innocent. Each archetype is carefully defined, capturing nuanced portrayals of entities such as guardian, martyr, and underdog for protagonists; tyrant, deceiver, and bigot for antagonists; and victim, scapegoat, and exploited for innocents. The dataset includes 1,378 recent news articles in five languages (Bulgarian, English, Hindi, European Portuguese, and Russian) focusing on two critical domains of global significance: the Ukraine-Russia War and Climate Change. Over 5,800 entity mentions have been annotated with role labels. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for research into role portrayal and has broader implications for news analysis. We describe the characteristics of the dataset and the annotation process, and we report evaluation results on fine-tuned state-of-the-art multilingual transformers and hierarchical zero-shot learning using LLMs at the level of a document, a paragraph, and a sentence.

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), addressing character substitution, missing, and redundant errors in Chinese spelling correction, with a benchmark and a training-free, prompt-free method using LLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Conventional Chinese spelling correction (CSC) has largely overlooked missing and redundant character errors, limiting its practical application. This paper aims to extend the task to include all three types of character errors.

**Method:** The authors constructed a C2EC benchmark from existing datasets and developed a method utilizing Levenshtein distance to manage character length changes, complemented by a prompt-based approach with a large language model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC) task.
	2. Development of a high-quality C2EC benchmark combining existing datasets.
	3. Implementation of a novel training-free, prompt-free method using LLMs that manages character length changes.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrated that a 14B-parameter LLM achieved performance comparable to much larger models on both CSC and C2EC tasks without requiring fine-tuning.

**Limitations:** The research may not fully address all nuances of character errors beyond the three types considered in C2EC.

**Conclusion:** The proposed C2EC task and the associated methodology significantly enhance the robustness and practical utility of Chinese character error correction.

**Abstract:** Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a crucial task that aims to correct character errors in Chinese text. While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our method enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times larger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.

**TL;DR:** InfiniSST is a new approach to simultaneous speech translation (SST), addressing challenges in processing unbounded speech streams.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Prior methods for simultaneous speech translation assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.

**Method:** The paper treats SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, using multi-latency augmentation for training and a KV cache management strategy for efficient inference.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** InfiniSST enhances performance in simultaneous speech translation through innovative data management techniques and cache strategies.

**Abstract:** Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code and demo at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

**Keywords:** Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Safety Alignment, Computational Efficiency, Preference Reordering

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new framework for addressing distribution shift in reinforcement learning algorithms for safety alignment of LLMs, significantly reducing computational overheads while improving safety performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of distribution shift in RL algorithms for safety alignment of LLMs leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies.

**Method:** The proposed method hypothesizes the stability of output distribution during off-policy training, allowing for preference data re-ranking to bypass online sampling from the target policy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a novel framework for preference reordering based on reward signals.
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach in addressing distribution shift.
	3. Achieved a significant reduction in computational overhead for RL safety alignment.

**Result:** The new framework greatly enhances safety performance and decreases computational overhead by approximately 300 times compared to existing approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By leveraging intrinsic safety judgment capabilities of models, the framework effectively mitigates distribution shift issues in RL algorithms for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), encounter the challenge of distribution shift. Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable. This stability allows the conversion of the sampling process from the target policy into a computationally efficient re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, we propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preference reordering. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift issue, remarkably enhancing the safety performance while avoiding about 300x computational overheads.

**Keywords:** large language models, data annotation, human preferences, error types, Russian language

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) as judges in Russian, introducing the Russian Error tyPes Annotation dataset (REPA) to assess LLM-generated responses.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to expand the research on LLMs as evaluators beyond English, specifically focusing on the Russian language, which has been underrepresented in this area.

**Method:** The authors created the REPA dataset containing 1k user queries and 2k LLM-generated responses, along with human annotator preferences on ten specific error types and overall rankings. Six generative LLMs were ranked across these error types using three rating systems and evaluated by eight LLM judges in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Russian Error tyPes Annotation dataset (REPA) for evaluating LLM outputs.
	2. Analysis of human and LLM judge preferences across various error types in the Russian language.
	3. Insights into the biases present in LLM judge evaluations.

**Result:** The results highlighted a gap in performance between LLM judges in Russian and English, with some alignment in ranking based on human preferences despite the challenges faced by LLM judges in fine-grained evaluations in Russian.

**Limitations:** The study acknowledges that LLM judges have performance gaps in fine-grained evaluation specifically for Russian, and further research is needed to enhance their effectiveness.

**Conclusion:** While LLM judges currently struggle with nuanced evaluations in Russian, the partial alignment with human preferences indicates potential for future improvements.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the novel paradigm of using LLMs as judges, where an LLM evaluates and scores the outputs of another LLM, which often correlates highly with human preferences. However, the use of LLM-as-a-judge has been primarily studied in English. In this paper, we evaluate this framework in Russian by introducing the Russian Error tyPes Annotation dataset (REPA), a dataset of 1k user queries and 2k LLM-generated responses. Human annotators labeled each response pair expressing their preferences across ten specific error types, as well as selecting an overall preference. We rank six generative LLMs across the error types using three rating systems based on human preferences. We also evaluate responses using eight LLM judges in zero-shot and few-shot settings. We describe the results of analyzing the judges and position and length biases. Our findings reveal a notable gap between LLM judge performance in Russian and English. However, rankings based on human and LLM preferences show partial alignment, suggesting that while current LLM judges struggle with fine-grained evaluation in Russian, there is potential for improvement.

**TL;DR:** MathFusion is a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning in LLMs through cross-problem instruction synthesis using fusion strategies.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need to improve mathematical problem-solving ability in LLMs beyond traditional instance-level data augmentation methods that do not leverage the relational structures in mathematical knowledge.

**Method:** MathFusion utilizes three fusion strategies: sequential fusion to model solution dependencies, parallel fusion to reinforce conceptual understanding, and conditional fusion to create selective context-aware problems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MathFusion framework for enhanced mathematical reasoning in LLMs
	2. Three innovative fusion strategies for cross-problem instruction synthesis
	3. Release of the MathFusionQA dataset and fine-tuned models

**Result:** Mathematical reasoning performance improved by 18.0 accuracy points across various benchmarks while maintaining high data efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MathFusion demonstrates significant advancements in LLM mathematical reasoning, outperforming conventional methods and requiring fewer synthetic instructions.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing hallucination detection methods are either computationally expensive or less accurate, which is not ideal for edge devices and resource-constrained environments.

**Method:** The framework employs a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention to classify sequence-level entropy patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD)
	2. Utilization of sequence-level entropy patterns for hallucination detection
	3. Demonstrates efficiency and accuracy in resource-constrained environments

**Result:** ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in detecting hallucinations, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while maintaining good performance in in-distribution cases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This method provides an efficient, accurate, and generalizable way to detect hallucinations, enhancing the credibility of LLM-generated content in critical applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.

**TL;DR:** LinkAlign is a framework designed to improve schema linking in Text-to-SQL models, addressing challenges in database retrieval and schema item grounding, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on benchmarking datasets.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in applying existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world, large-scale, multi-database environments.

**Method:** LinkAlign introduces a modular framework with three key steps: enhanced retrieval of databases, isolation of irrelevant information, and improved schema extraction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel framework for schema linking in Text-to-SQL
	2. Development of a synthetic dataset (AmbiDB) for realistic evaluation
	3. Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Spider 2.0-Lite benchmark

**Result:** LinkAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines on all schema linking metrics, achieving a new state-of-the-art score of 33.09% on the Spider 2.0-Lite benchmark.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LinkAlign significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of the Text-to-SQL pipeline in large-scale database environments.

**Abstract:** Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in applying existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world, large-scale, multi-database environments. Through error analysis, we identify two major challenges in schema linking: (1) Database Retrieval: accurately selecting the target database from a large schema pool, while effectively filtering out irrelevant ones; and (2) Schema Item Grounding: precisely identifying the relevant tables and columns within complex and often redundant schemas for SQL generation. Based on these, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework tailored for large-scale databases with thousands of fields. LinkAlign comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. Each stage supports both Agent and Pipeline execution modes, enabling balancing efficiency and performance via modular design. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct AmbiDB, a synthetic dataset designed to reflect the ambiguity of real-world schema linking. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that LinkAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines on all schema linking metrics. Notably, it improves the overall Text-to-SQL pipeline and achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 33.09% on the Spider 2.0-Lite benchmark using only open-source LLMs, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growth of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has highlighted inefficiencies in token usage, memory, and inference time, necessitating a review of methods to enhance their efficiency.

**Method:** The paper categorizes efficient inference methods for LRMs into explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and implicit latent CoT, analyzing their performance and efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a taxonomy for efficient inference methods in LRMs.
	2. Empirical analysis of existing methods focusing on performance and efficiency.
	3. Identification of open challenges and potential strategies for improving LRM inference.

**Result:** Empirical analyses indicate that while explicit methods preserve reasoning structure, implicit methods can efficiently encode reasoning with fewer tokens. Various approaches like model merging and new architectures are suggested to improve efficiency.

**Limitations:** Limited coverage on practical applications and actual implementations of suggested methods.

**Conclusion:** The study serves as a guide for researchers to address challenges in enhancing LRM efficiency, advocating for a balance between interpretability and computational efficiency in reasoning processes.

**Abstract:** Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning to reason, exhibiting promising performance in complex task-solving. However, their deliberative reasoning process leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference methods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token inefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from performance and efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers. We hope this work serves as a valuable guide, helping researchers overcome challenges in this vibrant field\footnote{https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Efficient-Inference-for-LRMs}.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates how generative large language models (LLMs) represent diverse viewpoints in annotation tasks and examines bias in their responses.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is growing interest in using generative LLMs for data labeling, but little research has focused on the bias inherent in their outputs, particularly in subjective tasks.

**Method:** The study evaluates LLM performance across four annotation tasks using four datasets, analyzing bias based on demographics and how LLMs agree with human annotators.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of bias in LLMs for subjective annotation tasks
	2. Findings on demographic alignment and item difficulty in labeling
	3. Recommendations for contextual fairness in ML applications

**Result:** The results indicate that LLMs do not show systematic substantial disagreement with human annotators based on demographics, but exhibit biases in similar directions across demographic categories.

**Limitations:** The analysis is contextual and may not generalize across all application areas of generative LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the need for contextual fairness evaluations and suggests that model choice alone is inadequate to address biases in LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** Researchers have proposed the use of generative large language models (LLMs) to label data for research and applied settings. This literature emphasizes the improved performance of these models relative to other natural language models, noting that generative LLMs typically outperform other models and even humans across several metrics. Previous literature has examined bias across many applications and contexts, but less work has focused specifically on bias in generative LLMs' responses to subjective annotation tasks. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show systematic substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Rather, we find that multiple LLMs tend to be biased in the same directions on the same demographic categories within the same datasets. Moreover, the disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task -- a measure of item difficulty -- is far more predictive of LLM agreement with human annotators. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners using LLMs for automated data annotation tasks. Specifically, we emphasize that fairness evaluations must be contextual, model choice alone will not solve potential issues of bias, and item difficulty must be integrated into bias assessments.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the superiority of language-only models over multimodal models in capturing experiential information and aligning with human fMRI responses.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research addresses the assumption that multimodal models provide richer, more human-like text representations than language-only models, a claim that lacks empirical support.

**Method:** The study compares word representations from contrastive multimodal models and language-only models to assess their ability to capture experiential information and their alignment with human fMRI responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the superior performance of language-only models over multimodal models in capturing experiential information.
	2. Showed that language-only models align better with human fMRI responses than multimodal models.
	3. Highlighted the necessity for improved model integration of multimodal data.

**Result:** Language-only models outperformed multimodal models in capturing experiential information and aligning with brain activity, revealing the former's ability to encode unique brain-relevant semantic information.

**Limitations:** The study does not explore the potential benefits or applications of multimodal models in other collaborative settings.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a need for computational models that better integrate diverse semantic information from multimodal sources.

**Abstract:** A common assumption in Computational Linguistics is that text representations learnt by multimodal models are richer and more human-like than those by language-only models, as they are grounded in images or audio -- similar to how human language is grounded in real-world experiences. However, empirical studies checking whether this is true are largely lacking. We address this gap by comparing word representations from contrastive multimodal models vs. language-only ones in the extent to which they capture experiential information -- as defined by an existing norm-based 'experiential model' -- and align with human fMRI responses. Our results indicate that, surprisingly, language-only models are superior to multimodal ones in both respects. Additionally, they learn more unique brain-relevant semantic information beyond that shared with the experiential model. Overall, our study highlights the need to develop computational models that better integrate the complementary semantic information provided by multimodal data sources.

**Motivation:** To fill the gap in existing benchmarks that overlook the complexity of processing diverse structured tables and the fine-grained perception needed for practical LLM-based applications.

**Method:** A new long-context tabular benchmark (NIAT) that treats individual table cells as unique entities, requiring models to extract target cells based on their locations or lookup questions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NeedleInATable (NIAT) benchmark for LLMs focused on structured tables
	2. Revealing performance gaps in current LLMs regarding table processing tasks
	3. Providing synthesized training data that improves LLM performance on tabular tasks

**Result:** Assessment of various LLMs shows a significant performance gap between downstream tabular tasks and NIAT, indicating weakness in true long-context understanding of structured tables.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Synthesized NIAT training data can enhance model performance on both NIAT and downstream tabular tasks, highlighting the necessity of robust capabilities in table understanding for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Processing structured tabular data, particularly large and lengthy tables, constitutes a fundamental yet challenging task for large language models (LLMs). However, existing long-context benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenge of diverse structured tables. Meanwhile, previous tabular benchmarks mainly consider downstream tasks that require high-level reasoning abilities, and overlook models' underlying fine-grained perception of individual table cells, which is crucial for practical and robust LLM-based table applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular benchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to extract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the simpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific correlations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly robust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve performance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the importance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability. Our data, code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### [207] [Unsupervised Classification of English Words Based on Phonological Information: Discovery of Germanic and Latinate Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11770)

*Takashi Morita, Timothy J. O'Donnell*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** phonology, etymology, unsupervised clustering, language learning, linguistic generalization

**Relevance Score:** 2

**TL;DR:** The study investigates the learnability of the phonological distinction between Germanic and Latinate words in English using computational methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research aims to explore how the historical etymology of words impacts their phonological rules and learnability for language learners.

**Method:** Computational evidence was gathered through unsupervised clustering of corpus-extracted English words based on phonotactic information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated that phonotactic information can lead to learnable etymological distinctions.
	2. Identified new linguistic features in word clusters.
	3. Provided hypotheses for future experimental research based on computational findings.

**Result:** The word clusters aligned with etymological distinctions and recovered various linguistic generalizations, while also revealing new features of quasi-etymological clusters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that the distinction between Germanic and Latinate words is learnable, offering new hypotheses for experimental study.

**Abstract:** Cross-linguistically, native words and loanwords follow different phonological rules. In English, for example, words of Germanic and Latinate origin exhibit different stress patterns, and a certain syntactic structure is exclusive to Germanic verbs. When seeing them as a cognitive model, however, such etymology-based generalizations face challenges in terms of learnability, since the historical origins of words are presumably inaccessible information for general language learners. In this study, we present computational evidence indicating that the Germanic-Latinate distinction in the English lexicon is learnable from the phonotactic information of individual words. Specifically, we performed an unsupervised clustering on corpus-extracted words, and the resulting word clusters largely aligned with the etymological distinction. The model-discovered clusters also recovered various linguistic generalizations documented in the previous literature regarding the corresponding etymological classes. Moreover, our findings also uncovered previously unrecognized features of the quasi-etymological clusters, offering novel hypotheses for future experimental studies.

**Keywords:** historical event extraction, LLMs, RAG, knowledge graph enhancement, semantic analysis

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs and enhancement strategies, revealing insights into their performance nuances and capabilities.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the efficiency and depth of historical event extraction from narrative text while addressing limitations of RDF/OWL reasoners in temporal and semantic analysis.

**Method:** Automatic historical event extraction models using LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with enhancement strategies like base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of automatic historical event extraction models using LLMs
	2. Evaluation of enhancement strategies on performance dimensions
	3. Creation of a translation pipeline for Coq proof assistant specifications

**Result:** Different enhancement strategies optimize various performance dimensions; base generation excels in breadth while RAG enhances precision.

**Limitations:** Model architecture sensitivity leads to variable performance outcomes across different LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates the potential of LLMs in historical event extraction and introduces an automated translation pipeline for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually. While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Combining Genetic Algorithms with Large Language Models results in superior constraint satisfaction and better solution quality compared to using LLMs alone.

**Abstract:** GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints. Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting, consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.
