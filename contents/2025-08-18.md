  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the challenges and processes involved in creating journalistic maps, particularly given the diverse backgrounds of data journalists.

**Method:** Analyzed 462 journalistic maps from five major news outlets and conducted semi-structured interviews with four data journalists.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a design space for journalistic maps with eight dimensions
	2. Identification of common design rationales in map production
	3. Empirical validation of the design space through practitioner feedback.

**Result:** Developed a design space with eight dimensions detailing article aspects and map features, and identified common design rationales among journalists.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide empirical data to aid researchers and journalists in enhancing the design and study of journalistic maps.

**Abstract:** Maps are essential to news media as they provide a familiar way to convey spatial context and present engaging narratives. However, the design of journalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance multiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience's expected data literacy, tight publication deadlines, and the team's technical skills. Data journalists often come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and data science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While previous studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process employed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific research questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do editorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we collected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news articles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result, we created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both properties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features of maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured interviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily. Through these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made by editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected the practitioners' feedback on our design space to externally validate it. With these results, we aim to provide researchers and journalists with empirical data to design and study journalistic maps.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve social interaction and communication between parents and their adult children living apart using music as a medium.

**Method:** The study involved a deployment of the DJ-Fam app with seven families over four weeks, analyzing their communication patterns and interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed DJ-Fam app to foster communication between parents and children through music.
	2. Conducted a deployment study demonstrating usage and impact on interactions.
	3. Identified the role of music in enhancing daily communication and mutual understanding.

**Result:** The findings indicate that DJ-Fam positively influenced parent-child interactions, leading to increased communication frequency and a diverse range of topics for discussion.

**Limitations:** The study involved a small sample size and was conducted in a specific cultural context (South Korea), which may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** DJ-Fam can effectively enrich parent-child relationships by creating opportunities for interaction through shared music experiences.

**Abstract:** This paper aims to foster social interaction between parents and young adult children living apart via music. Our approach transforms their music-listening moment into an opportunity to listen to the other's favorite songs and enrich interaction in their daily lives. To this end, we explore the current practice and needs of parent-child communication and the experience and perception of music-mediated interaction. Based on the findings, we developed DJ-Fam, a mobile application that enables parents and children to listen to their favorite songs and use them as conversation starters to foster parent-child interaction. From our deployment study with seven families over four weeks in South Korea, we show the potential of DJ-Fam to influence parent-child interaction and their mutual understanding and relationship positively. Specifically, DJ-Fam considerably increases the frequency of communication and diversifies the communication channels and topics, all of which are satisfactory to the participants.

**Motivation:** Indigenous communities are challenged in preserving their cultural heritage due to systemic marginalization and urban development.

**Method:** Develops two semantic pipelines: a visual pipeline for image similarity and a textual pipeline for semantic relationships from descriptions, integrated into an interactive tool.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of visual and textual semantic pipelines
	2. Creation of an interactive visualization tool
	3. Facilitation of cultural engagement and exploration of Indigenous heritage

**Result:** The system allows similarity-based navigation and exploration through temporal and geographic contexts, aiding curatorial tasks and public engagement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AI can ethically contribute to cultural preservation practices by revealing connections within Indigenous collections.

**Abstract:** Indigenous communities face ongoing challenges in preserving their cultural heritage, particularly in the face of systemic marginalization and urban development. In Brazil, the Museu Nacional dos Povos Indigenas through the Tainacan platform hosts the country's largest online collection of Indigenous objects and iconographies, providing a critical resource for cultural engagement. Using publicly available data from this repository, we present a data-driven initiative that applies artificial intelligence to enhance accessibility, interpretation, and exploration. We develop two semantic pipelines: a visual pipeline that models image-based similarity and a textual pipeline that captures semantic relationships from item descriptions. These embedding spaces are projected into two dimensions and integrated into an interactive visualization tool we also developed. In addition to similarity-based navigation, users can explore the collection through temporal and geographic lenses, enabling both semantic and contextualized perspectives. The system supports curatorial tasks, aids public engagement, and reveals latent connections within the collection. This work demonstrates how AI can ethically contribute to cultural preservation practices.

### [4] [Generation and Evaluation in the Human Invention Process through the Lens of Game Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10914)

*Katherine M. Collins, Graham Todd, Cedegao E. Zhang, Adrian Weller, Julian Togelius, Junyi Chu, Lionel Wong, Thomas L. Griffiths, Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** cognitive science, game design, human invention, creativity, model-based evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 3

**TL;DR:** This paper explores human invention in game design, focusing on how rules and problems are actively modified and created by individuals. It analyzes game creation by novice designers through a dataset of over 450 games, highlighting cognitive mechanisms involved in evaluating and refining game proposals.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding human creativity in rule modification and problem creation, particularly in the context of game design.

**Method:** Analyzed a dataset of over 450 games created by participants, focusing on cognitive mechanisms such as associative proposals and compute-bounded model-based evaluations during game invention.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examination of cognitive processes in game invention
	2. Empirical analysis using a large dataset of human-created games
	3. Introduction of a computational toolkit for empirical studies in human creativity.

**Result:** Preliminary analysis suggests that the invention of new games aligns with a model that incorporates estimates of game quality, indicating that both proposal generation and evaluation significantly influence game design.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to novice game creators and may not generalize to expert game design.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes that human invention relies on both the creativity of proposals and the evaluation processes, providing insights into game design and a computational framework for studying human innovation.

**Abstract:** The human ability to learn rules and solve problems has been a central concern of cognitive science research since the field's earliest days. But we do not just follow rules and solve problems given to us by others: we modify those rules, create new problems, and set new goals and tasks for ourselves and others. Arguably, even more than rule following and problem solving, human intelligence is about creatively breaking and stretching the rules, changing the game, and inventing new problems worth thinking about. Creating a good rule or a good problem depends not just on the ideas one can think up but on how one evaluates such proposals. Here, we study invention through the lens of game design. We focus particularly on the early stages of novice, "everyday" game creation, where the stakes are low. We draw on a dataset of over 450 human created games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of two-player grid-based strategy games. We consider two different cognitive mechanisms that may be at work during the early processes of intuitive game invention: an associative proposal based on previous games one has seen and compute-bounded model-based evaluation that an everyday game creator may use to refine their initial draft proposals. In our preliminary work, we conduct a model-based analysis of how people invented new games based on prior experience and find that generated games are best described by a model which incorporates model-based estimates of game quality at a population level. Our work points to how human invention is based not only on what people propose, but how they evaluate and offers a computational toolkit to scale empirical studies of model-based simulation in open-ended human innovation.

### [5] [Multimodal Quantitative Measures for Multiparty Behaviour Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10916)

*Ojas Shirekar, Wim Pouw, Chenxu Hao, Vrushank Phadnis, Thabo Beeler, Chirag Raman*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** digital humans, multiparty interactions, social behavior evaluation, skeletal motion data, evaluation metrics

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a framework for evaluating multiparty social behavior in digital humans' skeletal motion data through three dimensions: synchrony, temporal alignment, and structural similarity.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in existing metrics for evaluating multiparty interactions in digital humans, focusing on contextual coordination dynamics.

**Method:** The authors introduce a unified, intervention-driven framework incorporating measures of synchrony (Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis), temporal alignment (Multiscale Empirical Mode Decomposition), and structural similarity (Soft Dynamic Time Warping) applied to interaction data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A unified framework for assessing multiparty social behavior in digital humans.
	2. Three distinct dimensions for evaluation: synchrony, temporal alignment, and structural similarity.
	3. Validation of metrics through controlled perturbations in movement and speech.

**Result:** Validation showed predictable shifts in social behavior metrics due to interventions like gesture dampening and speech-gesture delays, demonstrating the framework's sensitivity and effectiveness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed metrics can effectively evaluate and refine socially intelligent agents by providing insights into aspects of social interaction.

**Abstract:** Digital humans are emerging as autonomous agents in multiparty interactions, yet existing evaluation metrics largely ignore contextual coordination dynamics. We introduce a unified, intervention-driven framework for objective assessment of multiparty social behaviour in skeletal motion data, spanning three complementary dimensions: (1) synchrony via Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis, (2) temporal alignment via Multiscale Empirical Mode Decompositionbased Beat Consistency, and (3) structural similarity via Soft Dynamic Time Warping. We validate metric sensitivity through three theory-driven perturbations -- gesture kinematic dampening, uniform speech-gesture delays, and prosodic pitch-variance reduction-applied to $\approx 145$ 30-second thin slices of group interactions from the DnD dataset. Mixed-effects analyses reveal predictable, joint-independent shifts: dampening increases CRQA determinism and reduces beat consistency, delays weaken cross-participant coupling, and pitch flattening elevates F0 Soft-DTW costs. A complementary perception study ($N=27$) compares judgments of full-video and skeleton-only renderings to quantify representation effects. Our three measures deliver orthogonal insights into spatial structure, timing alignment, and behavioural variability. Thereby forming a robust toolkit for evaluating and refining socially intelligent agents. Code available on \href{https://github.com/tapri-lab/gig-interveners}{GitHub}.

### [6] [Managing the unexpected: Operator behavioural data and its value in predicting correct alarm responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10917)

*Chidera W. Amazu, Joseph Mietkiewicz, Ammar N. Abbas, Gabriele Baldissone, Davide Fissore, Micaela Demichela, Anders L. Madsen, Maria Chiara Leva*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** psychophysiology, operator behavior, alarm response, predictive modeling, human-in-the-loop

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of real-time data from process and operator-system interactions to predict operator behavior and responses to critical plant conditions, without using intrusive wearable measures.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore ways of gaining insight into control room operators' behavior and mental workload without intrusive physiological measures.

**Method:** Data was collected from a formaldehyde production plant simulator using human-in-the-loop experimental configurations. Step-wise logistic regression and Bayesian network models were employed for analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified predictive metrics for operator performance in alarm scenarios
	2. Demonstrated the utility of non-intrusive data from control system logs
	3. Provided insights on enhancing operator support measures in critical situations

**Result:** The study identified key predictive metrics that serve as precursors to overall system performance in alarm response scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Real-time behavioral metrics can enhance decision-making by predicting outcomes and providing timely support for operators during critical scenarios.

**Abstract:** Data from psychophysiological measures can offer new insight into control room operators' behaviour, cognition, and mental workload status. This can be particularly helpful when combined with appraisal of capacity to respond to possible critical plant conditions (i.e. critical alarms response scenarios). However, wearable physiological measurement tools such as eye tracking and EEG caps can be perceived as intrusive and not suitable for usage in daily operations. Therefore, this article examines the potential of using real-time data from process and operator-system interactions during abnormal scenarios that can be recorded and retrieved from the distributed control system's historian or process log, and their capacity to provide insight into operator behavior and predict their response outcomes, without intruding on daily tasks. Data for this study were obtained from a design of experiment using a formaldehyde production plant simulator and four human-in-the-loop experimental support configurations. A comparison between the different configurations in terms of both behaviour and performance is presented in this paper. A step-wise logistic regression and a Bayesian network models were used to achieve this objective. The results identified some predictive metrics and the paper discuss their value as precursor or predictor of overall system performance in alarm response scenarios. Knowledge of relevant and predictive behavioural metrics accessible in real time can better equip decision-makers to predict outcomes and provide timely support measures for operators.

### [7] [Human-AI collaboration or obedient and often clueless AI in instruct, serve, repeat dynamics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10919)

*Mohammed Saqr, Kamila Misiejuk, Sonsoles López-Pernas*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** human-AI collaboration, LLMs, cognitive partnership, instructive pattern, interaction dynamics

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study explores the dynamics of human-AI collaboration in solving complex problems, revealing that current LLMs function more as instructive tools than as collaborative partners.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the nature of human-AI interactions in cognitively demanding tasks and to challenge prevailing assumptions about LLMs as collaborative entities.

**Method:** Qualitative coding of student-AI interactions, followed by transition network analysis, sequence analysis, partial correlation networks, and frequency comparisons through chi-square and Person-residual shaded Mosaic plots.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of dominant Instructive interaction patterns in human-AI collaboration.
	2. Demonstration of misalignment between student prompts and AI outputs.
	3. Recommendations for designing AI systems to enhance cognitive partnership.

**Result:** The study found a dominant Instructive interaction pattern, highlighting a lack of synergy between students and AI, with no significant correlations identified between assignment complexity, prompt length, and student performance.

**Limitations:** Focused primarily on interaction patterns without a deeper dive into cognitive engagement mechanisms.

**Conclusion:** Current LLMs are more instruction-following than cognitively aligned partners, indicating a need for AI systems that enhance cognitive collaboration.

**Abstract:** While research on human-AI collaboration exists, it mainly examined language learning and used traditional counting methods with little attention to evolution and dynamics of collaboration on cognitively demanding tasks. This study examines human-AI interactions while solving a complex problem. Student-AI interactions were qualitatively coded and analyzed with transition network analysis, sequence analysis and partial correlation networks as well as comparison of frequencies using chi-square and Person-residual shaded Mosaic plots to map interaction patterns, their evolution, and their relationship to problem complexity and student performance. Findings reveal a dominant Instructive pattern with interactions characterized by iterative ordering rather than collaborative negotiation. Oftentimes, students engaged in long threads that showed misalignment between their prompts and AI output that exemplified a lack of synergy that challenges the prevailing assumptions about LLMs as collaborative partners. We also found no significant correlations between assignment complexity, prompt length, and student grades suggesting a lack of cognitive depth, or effect of problem difficulty. Our study indicates that the current LLMs, optimized for instruction-following rather than cognitive partnership, compound their capability to act as cognitively stimulating or aligned collaborators. Implications for designing AI systems that prioritize cognitive alignment and collaboration are discussed.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Augmented reality can enhance user-robot interaction by facilitating more natural and precise instructions via GhostObjects.

**Abstract:** Robots are increasingly capable of autonomous operations, yet human interaction remains essential for issuing personalized instructions. Instead of directly controlling robots through Programming by Demonstration (PbD) or teleoperation, we propose giving instructions by interacting with GhostObjects-world-aligned, life-size virtual twins of physical objects-in augmented reality (AR). By direct manipulation of GhostObjects, users can precisely specify physical goals and spatial parameters, with features including real-world lasso selection of multiple objects and snapping back to default positions, enabling tasks beyond simple pick-and-place.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Generative AI, Household safety, Multi-agent system, Privacy, Family communication

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The study investigates families' perceptions of generative AI in enhancing household safety through specialized AI agents, revealing preferences for distributed roles among agents.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Families are facing increasing safety challenges in digital and physical environments, and GenAI offers new support opportunities.

**Method:** A two-phase qualitative study with individual interviews and collaborative sessions involving 13 parent-child dyads.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified family roles for AI agents in safety contexts
	2. Proposed a multi-agent system with privacy-preserving principles
	3. Explored generational differences in trust towards AI agents

**Result:** Families preferred multiple AI agents for safety-related tasks, each embodying familiar caregiving roles, with distinct privacy preferences and communication needs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A proposed multi-agent system design emphasizing privacy principles can help balance safety, privacy, and autonomy.

**Abstract:** As families face increasingly complex safety challenges in digital and physical environments, generative AI (GenAI) presents new opportunities to support household safety through multiple specialized AI agents. Through a two-phase qualitative study consisting of individual interviews and collaborative sessions with 13 parent-child dyads, we explored families' conceptualizations of GenAI and their envisioned use of AI agents in daily family life. Our findings reveal that families preferred to distribute safety-related support across multiple AI agents, each embodying a familiar caregiving role: a household manager coordinating routine tasks and mitigating risks such as digital fraud and home accidents; a private tutor providing personalized educational support, including safety education; and a family therapist offering emotional support to address sensitive safety issues such as cyberbullying and digital harassment. Families emphasized the need for agent-specific privacy boundaries, recognized generational differences in trust toward AI agents, and stressed the importance of maintaining open family communication alongside the assistance of AI agents. Based on these findings, we propose a multi-agent system design featuring four privacy-preserving principles: memory segregation, conversational consent, selective data sharing, and progressive memory management to help balance safety, privacy, and autonomy within family contexts.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a human-AI coaching system designed to support novice entrepreneurs and their mentors by improving metacognitive thinking and enhancing meeting quality through a large language model and a cognitive model of entrepreneurial risk.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Novice entrepreneurs struggle with metacognitive demands while mentors have limited ability to provide tailored support due to time constraints. This study aims to improve the interaction between novices and mentors in the context of entrepreneurship.

**Method:** The system integrates a cognitive model of entrepreneurial risk and a large language model (LLM) to ask diagnostic questions, challenging novices' thought processes and aiding mentors in planning effective meetings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a human-AI coaching system for entrepreneurship
	2. Scaffolding metacognition in novice entrepreneurs
	3. Design principles for proactive AI in ill-defined domains

**Result:** Field deployments showed that the AI system enhanced novice metacognition, enabled mentors to create emotionally attuned meeting strategies, and improved the depth, intentionality, and focus of meetings, while revealing tensions related to trust and AI expectations.

**Limitations:** Key tensions around trust, misdiagnosis, and expectations of AI were identified but require further examination.

**Conclusion:** The findings contribute to the understanding of design principles for proactive AI systems that aid metacognition and collaboration in complex domains, with implications for fields such as healthcare and education.

**Abstract:** Entrepreneurship requires navigating open-ended, ill-defined problems: identifying risks, challenging assumptions, and making strategic decisions under deep uncertainty. Novice founders often struggle with these metacognitive demands, while mentors face limited time and visibility to provide tailored support. We present a human-AI coaching system that combines a domain-specific cognitive model of entrepreneurial risk with a large language model (LLM) to proactively scaffold both novice and mentor thinking. The system proactively poses diagnostic questions that challenge novices' thinking and helps both novices and mentors plan for more focused and emotionally attuned meetings. Critically, mentors can inspect and modify the underlying cognitive model, shaping the logic of the system to reflect their evolving needs. Through an exploratory field deployment, we found that using the system supported novice metacognition, helped mentors plan emotionally attuned strategies, and improved meeting depth, intentionality, and focus--while also surfaced key tensions around trust, misdiagnosis, and expectations of AI. We contribute design principles for proactive AI systems that scaffold metacognition and human-human collaboration in complex, ill-defined domains, offering implications for similar domains like healthcare, education, and knowledge work.

	3. Highlighting the role of IDNs in supporting transformative learning experiences.

**Result:** The application of CLASS to two case studies demonstrates its effectiveness in fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving among learners.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** IDNs can serve as transformative tools for learning about complex systems and interdependencies, enhancing engagement and understanding in a digital age.

**Abstract:** This paper explores how Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) can support learners in developing the critical literacies needed to address complex societal challenges, so-called wicked problems, such as climate change, pandemics, and social inequality. While digital technologies offer broad access to narratives and data, they also contribute to misinformation and the oversimplification of interconnected issues. IDNs enable learners to navigate nonlinear, interactive stories, fostering deeper understanding and engagement. We introduce Systemic Learning IDNs: interactive narrative experiences explicitly designed to help learners explore and reflect on complex systems and interdependencies. To guide their creation and use, we propose the CLASS framework, a structured model that integrates systems thinking, design thinking, and storytelling. This transdisciplinary approach supports learners in developing curiosity, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. Focusing on the classroom context, we apply CLASS to two cases, one commercial narrative simulation and one educational prototype, offering a comparative analysis and practical recommendations for future design and implementation. By combining narrative, systems mapping, and participatory design, this paper highlights how IDNs can become powerful tools for transformative, systems-oriented learning in an increasingly complex world.

**Conclusion:** AI can create dynamic, personalized learning environments through student-driven feedback loops and iterative refinement.

**Abstract:** A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach leverages generative AI to enhance personalized learning by directly integrating student feedback into AI-generated solutions. Students critique and modify AI responses using predefined feedback tags, fostering deeper engagement and understanding. This empowers students to actively shape their learning, with AI serving as an adaptive partner. The system uses a tagging technique and prompt engineering to personalize content, informing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant educational material and adjust explanations in real time. This builds on existing research in adaptive learning, demonstrating how student-driven feedback loops can modify AI-generated responses for improved student retention and engagement, particularly in STEM education. Preliminary findings from a study with STEM students indicate improved learning outcomes and confidence compared to traditional AI tools. This work highlights AI's potential to create dynamic, feedback-driven, and personalized learning environments through iterative refinement.

**Method:** The study involved interviews with 14 certified NVC trainers and co-design sessions with 13 lay users of online communication technologies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Needs-Conscious Design framework
	2. Identification of the Empathy Fog phenomenon
	3. Guidelines for consentful AI design in communication

**Result:** Identified three pillars of Needs-Conscious Design and described a phenomenon termed 'Empathy Fog' that affects user interaction with AI.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Needs-Conscious Design provides a framework for using AI to foster, rather than hinder, human connections, incorporating a consent-based approach to emotional data handling.

**Abstract:** We introduce Needs-Conscious Design, a human-centered framework for AI-mediated communication that builds on the principles of Nonviolent Communication (NVC). We conducted an interview study with N=14 certified NVC trainers and a diary study and co-design with N=13 lay users of online communication technologies to understand how NVC might inform design that centers human relationships. We define three pillars of Needs-Conscious Design: Intentionality, Presence, and Receptiveness to Needs. Drawing on participant co-designs, we provide design concepts and illustrative examples for each of these pillars. We further describe a problematic emergent property of AI-mediated communication identified by participants, which we call Empathy Fog, and which is characterized by uncertainty over how much empathy, attention, and effort a user has actually invested via an AI-facilitated online interaction. Finally, because even well-intentioned designs may alter user behavior and process emotional data, we provide guiding questions for consentful Needs-Conscious Design, applying an affirmative consent framework used in social media contexts. Needs-Conscious Design offers a foundation for leveraging AI to facilitate human connection, rather than replacing or obscuring it.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance interaction and address frequent misunderstandings in educational discussion forums, leveraging AI tools.

**Method:** The approach Misunderstanding to Mastery (M2M) integrates LLMs and RAG to analyze discussions from three computer science courses, engaging 1355 students and 2878 posts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the M2M framework for misunderstanding identification
	2. Analysis of real classroom data with instructor feedback
	3. Assessment of ethical considerations in data usage

**Result:** Instructors considered the M2M approach effective for identifying misunderstandings and generating actionable insights, while noting the need for improved grouping, metrics, validation, and ethical considerations.

**Limitations:** Need for more nuanced groupings, clearer evaluation metrics, and validation processes for resources generated.

**Conclusion:** The integration of AI can significantly enhance educational practices by addressing misunderstandings in student discussions, although further refinement is needed.

**Abstract:** In the contemporary educational landscape, particularly in large classroom settings, discussion forums have become a crucial tool for promoting interaction and addressing student queries. These forums foster a collaborative learning environment where students engage with both the teaching team and their peers. However, the sheer volume of content generated in these forums poses two significant interconnected challenges: How can we effectively identify common misunderstandings that arise in student discussions? And once identified, how can instructors use these insights to address them effectively? This paper explores the approach to integrating large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to tackle these challenges. We then demonstrate the approach Misunderstanding to Mastery (M2M) with authentic data from three computer science courses, involving 1355 students with 2878 unique posts, followed by an evaluation with five instructors teaching these courses. Results show that instructors found the approach promising and valuable for teaching, effectively identifying misunderstandings and generating actionable insights. Instructors highlighted the need for more fine-grained groupings, clearer metrics, validation of the created resources, and ethical considerations around data anonymity.

### [16] [Is General-Purpose AI Reasoning Sensitive to Data-Induced Cognitive Biases? Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11278)

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** cognitive biases, general-purpose AI, software engineering, benchmarking, language models

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates cognitive biases in general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems within software engineering using a dynamic benchmarking framework. It finds that GPAI systems exhibit cognitive biases influenced by linguistic cues, with varying sensitivity based on task complexity.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to understand if GPAI systems, which are trained on human-generated data, exhibit cognitive biases that can affect their decision-making in software engineering.

**Method:** A dynamic benchmarking framework was developed, featuring a seed set of 16 tasks exhibiting cognitive biases, supplemented by an on-demand augmentation pipeline that generates diverse task variants while preserving bias-inducing cues, evaluated using GPAI systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the first dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating bias in GPAI in software engineering workflows
	2. Creation of an augmentation pipeline to ensure diversity and realism in task scenarios
	3. Identification of cognitive biases in leading GPAI systems and their reliance on linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning

**Result:** Leading GPAI systems consistently exhibited cognitive biases, relying on shallow linguistic heuristics in their decision-making, with bias sensitivity increasing with task complexity.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on a limited set of cognitive biases and may not encompass all biases present in GPAI systems or software engineering tasks.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight significant risks associated with cognitive biases in GPAI systems, particularly as task complexity increases, emphasizing the need for vigilant deployment practices in software engineering.

**Abstract:** Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases?   To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions.   To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the embedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased reasoners.   We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning. All systems exhibit cognitive biases (ranging from 5.9% to 35% across types), with bias sensitivity increasing sharply with task complexity (up to 49%), highlighting critical risks in real-world software engineering deployments.

**Keywords:** virtual reality, navigation, game design, cybersickness, presence

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** The paper explores a novel virtual navigation technique in VR games that enhances player presence and walking distance by promoting physical walking instead of teleportation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the feeling of presence in virtual reality games by addressing the limitations of room-scale motion and current navigation techniques like teleportation.

**Method:** The study introduces a navigation metaphor that allows players to physically walk while the system proportionally increases the modeled eye distance, reducing cybersickness and enhancing the feeling of being in a miniature world.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a navigation metaphor that emphasizes physical walking
	2. Significant increase in player presence and distance walked compared to teleportation
	3. Derivation of game design implications based on the findings

**Result:** The proposed navigation technique significantly increases player presence and walking distances compared to traditional teleportation methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that integrating this new navigation technique can enhance the VR gaming experience and lead to important game design implications.

**Abstract:** Virtual reality games are often centered around our feeling of "being there". That presence can be significantly enhanced by supporting physical walking. Although modern virtual reality systems enable room-scale motions, the size of our living rooms is not enough to explore vast virtual environments. Developers bypass that limitation by adding virtual navigation such as teleportation. Although such techniques are intended (or designed) to extend but not replace natural walking, what we often observe are nonmoving players beaming to a location that is one real step ahead. Our navigation metaphor emphasizes physical walking by promoting players into giants on demand to cover large distances. In contrast to flying, our technique proportionally increases the modeled eye distance, preventing cybersickness and creating the feeling of being in a miniature world. Our evaluations underpin a significantly increased presence and walking distance compared to the teleportation approach. Finally, we derive a set of game design implications related to the integration of our technique.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel augmented-walking technique using a virtual tunnel to extend walking space in VR while preventing cybersickness.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to extend physical walking space in virtual environments to enhance user experience without causing cybersickness.

**Method:** The proposed method employs a virtual tunnel that allows real walking within a shorter actual distance while hiding visual flow and providing windows that indicate movement speed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel virtual tunnel concept for VR locomotion
	2. Prevention of cybersickness while enhancing physical activity
	3. Maintenance of user presence during gameplay

**Result:** The evaluation showed that this technique effectively prevents cybersickness, promotes physical activity, and maintains user presence in the virtual environment.

**Limitations:** The approach may still require further testing across a wider range of VR environments and user profiles.

**Conclusion:** The augmented-walking approach is a viable solution for increasing the physical walking range in virtual reality applications, addressing both user comfort and engagement.

**Abstract:** The size of most virtual environments exceeds the tracking space available for physical walking. One solution to this disparity is to extend the available walking range by augmenting users' actual movements. However, the resulting increase in visual flow can easily cause cybersickness. Therefore, we present a novel augmented-walking approach for virtual reality games. Our core concept is a virtual tunnel that spans the entire travel distance when viewed from the outside. However, its interior is only a fraction as long, allowing users to cover the distance by real walking. Whereas the tunnel hides the visual flow from the applied movement acceleration, windows on the tunnel's walls still reveal the actual expedited motion. Our evaluation reveals that our approach avoids cybersickness while enhancing physical activity and preserving presence. We finish our paper with a discussion of the design considerations and limitations of our proposed locomotion technique.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores user preferences for AI ethics principles across different cultural contexts, revealing significant variations and distinct user cohorts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** As AI systems increasingly integrate into daily life, understanding user values regarding ethical principles in AI design is essential.

**Method:** A discrete choice experiment was conducted across four countries to quantify user preferences for 11 ethical principles related to AI.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical evidence of user prioritization of AI ethics principles
	2. Navigation of ethics tailored to culture and context
	3. Support for developing regulatory mechanisms based on user preferences

**Result:** Users prioritize privacy, justice & fairness, and transparency, but preferences vary based on culture and application context. Four distinct user cohorts were identified.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide empirical evidence for varying user priorities among AI ethics principles and suggest a user-centered approach to operationalize AI ethics.

**Abstract:** As AI systems increasingly permeate everyday life, designers and developers face mounting pressure to balance innovation with ethical design choices. To date, the operationalisation of AI ethics has predominantly depended on frameworks that prescribe which ethical principles should be embedded within AI systems. However, the extent to which users value these principles remains largely unexplored in the existing literature. In a discrete choice experiment conducted in four countries, we quantify user preferences for 11 ethical principles. Our findings indicate that, while users generally prioritise privacy, justice & fairness, and transparency, their preferences exhibit significant variation based on culture and application context. Latent class analysis further revealed four distinct user cohorts, the largest of which is ethically disengaged and defers to regulatory oversight. Our findings offer (1) empirical evidence of uneven user prioritisation of AI ethics principles, (2) actionable guidance for operationalising ethics tailored to culture and context, (3) support for the development of robust regulatory mechanisms, and (4) a foundation for advancing a user-centred approach to AI ethics, motivated independently from abstract moral theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To fill the knowledge gap regarding how physical workspaces shape group mood experiences and the role of intelligent technologies in mood regulation.

**Method:** A qualitative user study involving 8 workgroups with a total of 26 participants was conducted to investigate the interaction between workspace factors and group mood.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies key factors impacting group mood in workspaces.
	2. Explores employee expectations for technological support in mood regulation.
	3. Suggests adaptive workspaces as potential interventions for improving group dynamics.

**Result:** Key factors influencing group mood were identified, alongside participants' expectations for mood-aware technologies concerning privacy and autonomy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest the importance of adaptive workspaces and the need for human-centered technologies to enhance group well-being.

**Abstract:** Group mood plays a crucial role in shaping workspace experiences, influencing group dynamics, team performance, and creativity. The perceived group mood depends on many, often subconscious, aspects such as individual emotional states or group life, which make it challenging to maintain a positive atmosphere. Intelligent technology could support mood regulation in physical office environments, for example, as adaptive ambient lighting for mood regulation. However, little is known about the relationship between the physical workspace and group mood dynamics. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a qualitative user study (N=8 workgroups and overall 26 participants) to explore how the physical workspace shapes group mood experiences and investigate employees' perspectives on intelligent mood-aware technologies. Our findings reveal key factors influencing group mood, and participants' expectations for supportive technology to preserve privacy and autonomy. Our work highlights the potential of adaptive and responsive workspaces while also emphasizing the need for human-centered, technology-driven interventions that benefit group well-being.

**Motivation:** LLM-based agents struggle in specialized domains like mental health diagnosis, which requires advanced capabilities for understanding user needs and generating accurate diagnostic results.

**Method:** The proposed DSM5AgentFlow simulates therapist-client dialogues with detailed client profiles to produce diagnostic questionnaires that follow ethical and legal guidelines, and evaluates these agents on conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the first LLM agent workflow for DSM-5 diagnostic questionnaires
	2. Enhances accuracy in mental health diagnosis through therapist-client dialogue simulations
	3. Provides an open-sourced resource for further research and development

**Result:** The framework successfully generates disorder predictions that are transparent and trustworthy, demonstrating improvements over previous approaches in generating accurate mental health diagnostics.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the framework is contingent on the quality of the underlying LLM and may still require clinician verification.

**Conclusion:** DSM5AgentFlow could serve as a valuable tool in mental health diagnoses, enhancing the accuracy and transparency of assessments while remaining aligned with ethical standards in clinical practice.

**Abstract:** LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

**Abstract:** The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By implementing the suggested frameworks and actions, interdisciplinary projects can improve their research quality and effectiveness, ultimately leading to better health outcomes.

**Abstract:** Collaboration between health science and visual analytics research is often hindered by different, sometimes incompatible approaches to research design. Health science often follows hypothesis-driven protocols, registered in advance, and focuses on reproducibility and risk mitigation. Visual analytics, in contrast, relies on iterative data exploration, prioritizing insight generation and analytic refinement through user interaction. These differences create challenges in interdisciplinary projects, including misaligned terminology, unrealistic expectations about data readiness, divergent validation norms, or conflicting explainability requirements. To address these persistent tensions, we identify seven research needs and actions: (1) guidelines for broader community adoption, (2) agreement on quality and validation benchmarks, (3) frameworks for aligning research tasks, (4) integrated workflows combining confirmatory and exploratory stages, (5) tools for harmonizing terminology across disciplines, (6) dedicated bridging roles for transdisciplinary work, and (7) cultural adaptation and mutual recognition. We organize these needs in a framework with three areas: culture, standards, and processes. They can constitute a research agenda for developing reliable, reproducible, and clinically relevant data-centric methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Cardio Load offers a flexible way to accumulate cardiovascular work from both workouts and everyday activities, thereby enhancing users' ability to improve their fitness levels over time.

**Abstract:** Cardio Load, introduced by Google in 2024, is a measure of cardiovascular work (also known as training load) resulting from all the user's activities across the day. It is based on heart rate reserve and captures both activity intensity and duration. Thanks to feedback from users and internal research, we introduce adaptive and personalized targets which will be set weekly. This feature will be available in the Public Preview of the Fitbit app after September 2025. This white paper provides a comprehensive overview of Cardio Load (CL) and how weekly CL targets are established, with examples shown to illustrate the effect of varying CL on the weekly target. We compare Cardio Load and Active Zone Minutes (AZMs), highlighting their distinct purposes, i.e. AZMs for health guidelines and CL for performance measurement. We highlight that CL is accumulated both during active workouts and incidental daily activities, so users are able top-up their CL score with small bouts of activity across the day.

**Motivation:** There is a need for intuitive interaction methods for users with occupied hands, as more computing devices integrate into daily life.

**Method:** The study introduced a wristband that captures hand microgestures, grasping poses, and object geometries, and employed a deep learning framework to analyze the signals and identify 30 microgestures from users holding various objects.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the first wearable device to recognize hand microgestures while hands are occupied
	2. Achieved 92.0% average accuracy in gesture recognition
	3. Publicly available dataset to support further research.

**Result:** In user studies, Grab-n-Go achieved an average recognition accuracy of 92.0% across different everyday objects and validated its performance with challenging deformable objects.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Grab-n-Go demonstrates the ability to provide seamless interactions without requiring users to change their object usage habits.

**Abstract:** As computing devices become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need for intuitive, always-available interaction methods, even when users' hands are occupied. In this paper, we introduce Grab-n-Go, the first wearable device that leverages active acoustic sensing to recognize subtle hand microgestures while holding various objects. Unlike prior systems that focus solely on free-hand gestures or basic hand-object activity recognition, Grab-n-Go simultaneously captures information about hand microgestures, grasping poses, and object geometries using a single wristband, enabling the recognition of fine-grained hand movements occurring within activities involving occupied hands. A deep learning framework processes these complex signals to identify 30 distinct microgestures, with 6 microgestures for each of the 5 grasping poses.

**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a growing application of mixed-initiative co-creative approaches in the creation of video games. The rapid advances in the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) systems further propel creative collaboration between humans and computational agents. In this tutorial, we present guidelines for researchers and practitioners to develop game design tools with a high degree of mixed-initiative co-creativity (MI-CCy). We begin by reviewing a selection of current works that will serve as case studies and categorize them by the type of game content they address. We introduce the MI-CCy Quantifier, a framework that can be used by researchers and developers to assess co-creative tools on their level of MI-CCy through a visual scheme of quantifiable criteria scales. We demonstrate the usage of the MI-CCy Quantifier by applying it to the selected works. This analysis enabled us to discern prevalent patterns within these tools, as well as features that contribute to a higher level of MI-CCy. We highlight current gaps in MI-CCy approaches within game design, which we propose as pivotal aspects to tackle in the development of forthcoming approaches.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a design grammar for creating AI tailored for children, integrating insights from animation and developmental theory.

**Read time:** 28 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for AI that children can intuitively understand and that supports their developmental needs.

**Method:** The paper pairs Piagetian developmental theory with design pattern extraction from 52 animation works to develop a six scaffold framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a six scaffold framework for child-centered AI design
	2. Integration of animation techniques with developmental theory
	3. Provision of design heuristics for enhancing children's interaction with AI

**Result:** The framework includes strategies for visual clarity, sound scaffolding, synchrony in cues, sidekick personas, storyplay, and narrative structure, enhancing learning and comfort for children.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By providing design heuristics based on developmental insights and storytelling techniques, the paper contributes to the field of child-centered AI design.

**Abstract:** To build AI that children can intuitively understand and benefit from, designers need a design grammar that serves their developmental needs. This paper bridges artificial intelligence design for children - an emerging field still defining its best practices - and animation, a well established field with decades of experience in engaging children through accessible storytelling. Pairing Piagetian developmental theory with design pattern extraction from 52 works of animation, the paper presents a six scaffold framework that integrates design insights transferable to child centred AI design: (1) signals for visual animacy and clarity, (2) sound for musical and auditory scaffolding, (3) synchrony in audiovisual cues, (4) sidekick style personas, (5) storyplay that supports symbolic play and imaginative exploration, and (6) structure in the form of predictable narratives. These strategies, long refined in animation, function as multimodal scaffolds for attention, understanding, and attunement, supporting learning and comfort. This structured design grammar is transferable to AI design. By reframing cinematic storytelling and child development theory as design logic for AI, the paper offers heuristics for AI that aligns with the cognitive stages and emotional needs of young users. The work contributes to design theory by showing how sensory, affective, and narrative techniques can inform developmentally attuned AI design. Future directions include empirical testing, cultural adaptation, and participatory co design.

**TL;DR:** A2HCoder is a hierarchical framework utilizing large language models to facilitate efficient algorithm-to-hardware translation for wireless communication systems, addressing challenges in bridging the gap between algorithm design and HDL implementation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The substantial gap between algorithm design and hardware implementation in wireless communication systems necessitates an efficient and agile method for translating algorithms to hardware effectively.

**Method:** A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework that decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks and performs step-by-step translation using external toolchains like MATLAB and Vitis HLS.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a hierarchical framework for algorithm-to-hardware translation
	2. Modular decomposition of algorithms into functional blocks
	3. Step-by-step translation enhancing robustness and reducing common hallucinations

**Result:** Validation in a real-world 5G wireless communication deployment demonstrates A2HCoder's practicality, reliability, and efficiency in hardware-level correctness and reduced hallucination issues.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A2HCoder effectively bridges the gap between high-level algorithm design and hardware implementation, providing a robust and interpretable solution to challenges faced in the deployment of algorithms in hardware.

**Abstract:** In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation. Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension, A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks, simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the 5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability, and deployment efficiency.

**Conclusion:** PersonaTwin demonstrates the feasibility of LLM digital twin approaches for creating realistic and emotionally nuanced user simulations, which can enhance personalized user modeling and behavior analysis.

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) afford new possibilities for user modeling and approximation of human behaviors, they often fail to capture the multidimensional nuances of individual users. In this work, we introduce PersonaTwin, a multi-tier prompt conditioning framework that builds adaptive digital twins by integrating demographic, behavioral, and psychometric data. Using a comprehensive data set in the healthcare context of more than 8,500 individuals, we systematically benchmark PersonaTwin against standard LLM outputs, and our rigorous evaluation unites state-of-the-art text similarity metrics with dedicated demographic parity assessments, ensuring that generated responses remain accurate and unbiased. Experimental results show that our framework produces simulation fidelity on par with oracle settings. Moreover, downstream models trained on persona-twins approximate models trained on individuals in terms of prediction and fairness metrics across both GPT-4o-based and Llama-based models. Together, these findings underscore the potential for LLM digital twin-based approaches in producing realistic and emotionally nuanced user simulations, offering a powerful tool for personalized digital user modeling and behavior analysis.

**Motivation:** To aid investors and enhance financial market stability by identifying company risk factors from news articles.

**Method:** Built a computational framework with a schema of seven aspects; annotated 744 news articles and benchmarked different ML models, including LLaMA-2.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a new schema for categorizing company risk factors from news articles.
	2. Conducted a comprehensive analysis using over 277K news articles.
	3. Demonstrated the superiority of fine-tuned models over few-shot prompting LLMs in risk factor extraction.

**Result:** Fine-tuned language models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs in identifying risk factors; analyzed over 277K articles showing insights into company operations.

**Limitations:** The study’s reliance on annotated news articles may limit generalizability; further research needed on broader datasets.

**Conclusion:** Fine-tuned models provide more reliable risk factor identification, highlighting the limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in this specific application.

**Abstract:** Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

**TL;DR:** Rule2Text is a framework that uses large language models to generate natural language explanations for mined logical rules in knowledge graphs, enhancing their accessibility and usability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for more interpretable logical rules derived from knowledge graphs, as existing rules are complex and challenging for humans to understand.

**Method:** The study employs large language models (LLMs) and various prompting strategies to generate explanations for mined logical rules, evaluating model performance through human assessments and developing an LLM-as-a-judge framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Rule2Text framework for generating natural language explanations from knowledge graphs
	2. Extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompting strategies
	3. Construction of high-quality ground truth datasets for fine-tuning models

**Result:** Fine-tuning with the best-performing model led to significant improvements in the quality of the generated explanations, especially in domain-specific applications.

**Limitations:** The framework's performance may vary across different types of knowledge graphs and datasets used for training.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of Rule2Text significantly advances the interpretability of knowledge graphs by providing clearer explanations for complex rules, making them more user-friendly.

**Abstract:** Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be enhanced through rule mining; however, the resulting logical rules are often difficult for humans to interpret due to their inherent complexity and the idiosyncratic labeling conventions of individual KGs. This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language explanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and usability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including Freebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the ogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1. We systematically evaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we conduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and clarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an LLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human evaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge, and human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth datasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning, with particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we integrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type information. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL.

**Motivation:** To enhance the generation quality of masked diffusion language models (MDMs) and establish them as a superior alternative to autoregressive language models.

**Method:** The authors propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method during the denoising process of MDMs, which utilizes soft-value-based verifiers to improve candidate generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a verifier-based method for MDMs during denoising
	2. Demonstration of MDMs' superiority over autoregressive models
	3. Significant improvement in generation quality using soft-value-based verifiers.

**Result:** Experiments show that MDMs, enhanced with a simple verifier setup, significantly outperform traditional autoregressive models in text-style transfer tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that integrating verifier systems into MDMs can lead to substantial improvements in generation quality, reinforcing their status as the state-of-the-art for discrete data.

**Abstract:** Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing literature.

**Result:** The evaluation of 47 LLMs revealed significant safety vulnerabilities, indicating critical gaps in existing safety frameworks for young users.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide practical guidelines for improving child-centric AI design and deployment by addressing distinct vulnerabilities of minors.

**Abstract:** The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence (13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47 diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing child-centric AI design and deployment.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of cross-lingual knowledge transfer in large language models, particularly hallucinations arising from multilingual facts during training.

**Method:** Synthetic multilingual datasets were used to train small Transformer models from scratch, allowing for the observation of how models develop representations across languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified learning phases in representation development for cross-lingual transfer.
	2. Developed metrics and visualizations to assess the impact of data distribution and tokenization on unification.
	3. Proposed methods to enhance cross-lingual transfer based on empirical findings.

**Result:** The study identifies critical phases of learning that involve either separate or unified representations of facts, demonstrating that unified representations are crucial for effective cross-lingual transfer.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Controlled training settings can illuminate the dynamics of pre-training in LLMs and highlight new methodologies to enhance cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer: they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating language model agents' capacity to adapt plans in response to external failures, revealing that current models struggle with backup planning despite being contextually aware.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how well language model agents can formulate alternative plans when their initial plans fail due to external factors.

**Method:** A specialized agentic planning benchmark was devised where agents search for functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, facing simulated external failures while maintaining solvable tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel benchmark for agentic planning under external failure conditions.
	2. Systematic analysis of the limitations of open-source and commercial language models in handling alternative plans.
	3. Identification of challenges in the performance of state-of-the-art models in dynamic environments.

**Result:** Language agents demonstrated difficulty in adapting to environmental feedback and struggled to pursue alternative action plans, even when the search space was limited.

**Limitations:** Current models struggle to execute backup plans and adapt to changes in environmental feedback; performance affected by search space size.

**Conclusion:** The performance of language agents on planning tasks is negatively affected by external failures, highlighting key limitations in current generative models and suggesting areas for future research.

**Abstract:** As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative models as well as promising directions for future work.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a reusable and topic-agnostic bias evaluation framework for LLMs
	2. Creation of a synthetic dataset focused on the Russia-Ukraine conflict

**Result:** The framework revealed aggregate bias scores indicating more positive sentiment toward Ukraine among evaluated LLMs, while allowing fine-grained analysis that uncovered significant variation in behavioral patterns across models.

**Limitations:** Further exploration is needed into different types of biases beyond those evaluated in this study.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework facilitates automated dataset generation and detailed bias assessment, applicable to various polarization-driven scenarios, and complements existing bias evaluation strategies.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks, especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse, gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques, certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable, granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of semantic categories.   As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3, Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and citizenship modification.   Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks. However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect iterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our results provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in dynamic, industry-facing environments.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the lack of natural, information-seeking questions in existing LLM benchmarks that challenge the capabilities of current models.

**Method:** A decomposed annotation pipeline was developed to elicit and manually answer complex, time-consuming natural questions at scale.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MoNaCo benchmark with 1,315 complex questions.
	2. Demonstration of LLMs' limitations in answering intricate queries.
	3. Public availability of the benchmark, codebase, and model predictions.

**Result:** Frontier LLMs tested on MoNaCo achieved a maximum F1 score of 61.2%, indicating significant challenges in low recall and hallucination issues.

**Limitations:** The benchmark focuses specifically on the challenges of handling complex queries, which may not represent all possible user needs in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** MoNaCo serves as a powerful resource to monitor and encourage improvements in reasoning models for complex real-world information-seeking questions.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a go-to tool for querying information. However, current LLM benchmarks rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking as well as genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and complex questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer natural time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the need for reasoning models that better handle the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking questions -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress.

**Result:** Results indicate that while LLMs excel in factual retrieval tasks, they struggle with semantic reasoning and explanations, particularly affected by trajectory length.

**Limitations:** The focus of the study is limited to the performance of LLMs on existing datasets without exploring potential improvements or alternative approaches.

**Conclusion:** The evaluation highlights both the competencies and limitations of leading LLMs in understanding the semantics of human mobility.

**Abstract:** This paper presents MobQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for human mobility data through natural language question answering.   While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility understanding.\footnote{MobQA dataset is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/mobqa.}

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the challenges multilingual pretraining poses for code-mixed, under-resourced languages and lays groundwork for future research.

**Abstract:** Tulu, a low-resource Dravidian language predominantly spoken in southern India, has limited computational resources despite its growing digital presence. This study presents the first benchmark dataset for Offensive Language Identification (OLI) in code-mixed Tulu social media content, collected from YouTube comments across various domains. The dataset, annotated with high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.984), includes 3,845 comments categorized into four classes: Not Offensive, Not Tulu, Offensive Untargeted, and Offensive Targeted. We evaluate a suite of deep learning models, including GRU, LSTM, BiGRU, BiLSTM, CNN, and attention-based variants, alongside transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). The BiGRU model with self-attention achieves the best performance with 82% accuracy and a 0.81 macro F1-score. Transformer models underperform, highlighting the limitations of multilingual pretraining in code-mixed, under-resourced contexts. This work lays the foundation for further NLP research in Tulu and similar low-resource, code-mixed languages.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** personalized learning, distractor generation, student misconceptions, large language models, Monte Carlo Tree Search

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a personalized distractor generation framework using a two-stage approach to tailor multiple-choice question options based on individual student misconceptions derived from their past QA records.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the diagnostic effectiveness of distractors in educational assessments by addressing the limitations of group-level distractor generation which often overlook individual reasoning errors.

**Method:** A training-free two-stage framework is proposed where the first stage constructs a student-specific misconception prototype using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to analyze past incorrect answers. The second stage utilizes this prototype to simulate the student's reasoning on new questions for generating personalized distractors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of personalized distractor generation for individual students.
	2. Two-stage framework leveraging MCTS for prototype construction and reasoning simulation.
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness through experimental results with 140 students.

**Result:** Experiments validate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors and effectively generalizes to group-level distractors.

**Limitations:** The framework relies on past QA records, which may be limited for some students, affecting the richness of generated distractors.

**Conclusion:** The personalized distractor generation framework emphasizes robustness and adaptability, enhancing the educational assessment process by tailoring content to individual student needs.

**Abstract:** Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach offers a viable solution for efficient multilingual speech translation, balancing speed and performance effectively, making it suitable for local deployment scenarios.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance, particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation. Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** E-CaTCH is a framework for detecting multimodal misinformation on social media, addressing temporal patterns and class imbalances by clustering posts, extracting features, and employing a trend-aware LSTM for event-level classification.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of detecting multimodal misinformation due to inconsistencies, temporal dynamics, and class imbalances necessitates a robust approach that captures the event-level structure connecting posts.

**Method:** E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events, extracts textual and visual features using BERT and ResNet, aligns features with cross-modal attention, and models temporal evolution with a trend-aware LSTM. It integrates adaptive class weighting and regularization techniques to improve learning and classification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of event-level structure in misinformation detection
	2. Utilization of trend-aware LSTM for temporal modeling
	3. Integration of adaptive class weighting and regularization techniques.

**Result:** E-CaTCH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments on multiple datasets, showcasing robustness and generalizability in diverse misinformation contexts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework effectively models the complexities in misinformation detection across modalities and time, offering practical applications in real-world scenarios.

**Abstract:** Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the effectiveness of multi-hop question answering by integrating structural and semantic knowledge rather than relying solely on one or the other.

**Method:** The paper proposes a hypergraph-based approach where entities and passages are structured into a hypergraph to facilitate cross-granularity integration of structural and semantic information through hypergraph diffusion and a retrieval enhancement module.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HGRAG for integrating structural and semantic data in MHQA
	2. Utilization of hypergraphs for relationship establishment between fine-grained entities and coarse-grained passages
	3. Demonstration of significant improvements in QA performance and retrieval efficiency.

**Result:** HGRAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in question answering performance and achieves a 6x increase in retrieval efficiency on benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed HGRAG method effectively integrates structural and semantic knowledge, significantly improving multi-hop question answering tasks.

**Abstract:** Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a 6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

**Motivation:** To assess the linguistic reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through puzzles from Linguistics Olympiad contests, focusing on low-resource languages.

**Method:** Analyzed LLM performance on 629 linguistic puzzles across 41 languages, labeling puzzles with linguistically informed features.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of LLMs on linguistic puzzles for low-resource languages
	2. Identification of performance discrepancies based on morphological complexity
	3. Proposed improvements in tokenization for better LLM performance in low-resource contexts

**Result:** LLMs performed poorly on puzzles with higher morphological complexity but better on those with linguistic features similar to English; word splitting improved results.

**Limitations:** Focus on a specific set of puzzles; results may not generalize to all linguistic reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights challenges in linguistic reasoning and the need for more informed tokenization approaches for low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free $\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert $\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales (32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness ($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional annotated benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TOXIFRENCH, a novel benchmark for French toxicity detection.
	2. Development of a dynamic weighted loss fine-tuning strategy.
	3. Demonstrated strong multilingual capability in toxicity detection.

**Result:** The fine-tuned 4B model, ToxiFrench, achieved state-of-the-art performance with a 13% improvement in F1 score over the baseline and outperformed larger models like GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on French and may need further validation across diverse dialects and cultures.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that SLMs can be more robust than larger models for toxicity detection; the approach can be generalized to other languages and safety-critical tasks.

**Abstract:** Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging. While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10% through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then, we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight: Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision, significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability, suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages and safety-critical classification tasks.

**Motivation:** To investigate how various LLMs respond to mental health inquiries and the impact of user demographics on these responses.

**Method:** The study evaluated responses from eight LLMs to twenty questions about mental health, scoring 2,880 answers for sentiment and emotional content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of multiple LLMs on mental health queries
	2. Insights into emotional expressions of LLMs based on mental health conditions
	3. Demonstration of minimal effect of demographic framing on responses

**Result:** Responses showed dominance of optimism, fear, and sadness, with Mixtral exhibiting the highest negative emotions and Llama displaying the most optimism.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Model selection is crucial in mental health contexts, as LLMs display unique emotional signatures influencing user experience and outcomes.

**Abstract:** Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models (LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values. Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user experience and outcomes.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** LLMs, over-refusal, SafeConstellations, machine learning, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper addresses LLMs' over-refusal behavior, proposing SafeConstellations, a method that significantly reduces refusal rates in specific tasks without compromising overall utility.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Over-refusal behavior in LLMs reduces their utility for benign tasks that resemble harmful instructions, affecting applications like sentiment analysis and translation.

**Method:** The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM behavior and introduce SafeConstellations, a method that shifts embeddings in the model's trajectory to minimize refusal rates on benign tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SafeConstellations to address over-refusal behavior in LLMs
	2. Empirical analysis of LLM refusal patterns
	3. Significant reduction of refusal rates without loss of utility

**Result:** The proposed method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% while maintaining the overall utility of the LLM.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SafeConstellations offers a principled approach to manage over-refusal in LLMs, enhancing their usability in critical applications.

**Abstract:** LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this research is to address the limitations of existing evaluation methods for automatic survey generation (ASG) systems, particularly their biases and over-reliance on LLMs for judgment.

**Method:** The authors propose SGSimEval, which evaluates ASG systems through assessments of outline, content, and references, integrating both LLM-based scoring and quantitative metrics with human preference evaluations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SGSimEval as a new benchmark for evaluating ASG systems.

	3. Demonstration of current ASG systems' strengths and weaknesses in generating survey content.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that current ASG systems excel in outline generation compared to humans, but they need improvement in content and reference generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new evaluation framework provides a robust approach to assessing ASG systems while aligning closely with human judgments.

**Abstract:** The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations, including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

**Motivation:** To address the need for reliable detection methods for LLM-generated text, which currently rely mainly on surface-level statistics.

**Method:** The study analyzes token log-probabilities using global DFT and local STFT to assess spectral properties, leading to the development of SpecDetect and SpecDetect++ for enhanced robustness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SpecDetect for LLM detection based on spectral analysis
	2. Enhanced version SpecDetect++ with sampling discrepancy mechanism
	3. Significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art models

**Result:** SpecDetect outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and speed, demonstrating a clear distinction between human-written and LLM-generated text based on spectral energy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work provides an efficient and interpretable solution to LLM detection, leveraging classical signal processing to identify fundamental differences in text generation.

**Abstract:** The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs) demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

**Abstract:** Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable and transparent formative feedback in future research.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that lightweight models can achieve competitive performance with proper fine-tuning and that the implementation is reproducible and adaptable to other domains as all code is publicly released.

**Abstract:** This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new method for generating extractive explanations from neural network predictions using gradient-based masking.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the increasing complexity of neural networks, there's a growing need for interpretable models that can provide clear explanations for their predictions.

**Method:** The proposed method utilizes gradient-based optimization to mask parts of the input that are not indicative of the predicted class, while incorporating a new regularization scheme to ensure explanations are sufficient, comprehensive, and compact.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a method for extractive explanations using gradient-based masking.
	2. Establishes a connection between rationale extraction in NLP and model interpretability.
	3. Demonstrates applicability of the method to both text and image data.

**Result:** The method successfully generates high-quality explanations for both textual and image inputs, demonstrating broader applicability across different data types.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach bridges model interpretability and rationale extraction, showing that effective rationale extraction can be done without a specialized model.

**Abstract:** Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are more broadly applicable to different input types.

**Motivation:** The traditional methods for training rationalized models often lead to instabilities and require multiple models for different tasks, which complicates the training process.

**Method:** We propose a single model that integrates the roles of a rationale selector, classifier, and complement classifier, thereby simplifying the training process and enhancing stability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a single model for rationale selection and classification
	2. Simplified training process leading to enhanced stability
	3. Significant improvements in rationale alignment with human annotations

**Result:** The new training paradigm yields substantial improvements in the alignment of rationales with human annotations and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance without requiring explicit supervision.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Our approach mitigates common pitfalls in existing methods, providing an efficient solution for model training while producing high-quality rationales relevant to classifications.

**Abstract:** We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles, leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales, thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with human annotations without any explicit supervision.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores whether fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on value surveys can modify their implicit value systems and behavior across various scenarios.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models encode preferences over human values, but modifying these preferences typically requires extensive training data. The authors investigate if a simpler approach, using value survey fine-tuning, can effectively alter model behavior.

**Method:** The authors construct value profiles for several open-source LLMs by having them rate 20 distinct human values. Subsequently, they fine-tune these models on value survey responses and evaluate changes in behavior through held-out survey questions and application in moral judgment scenarios using contextualized datasets derived from Reddit and text-based games.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of value profiles for open-source LLMs based on human values.
	2. Novel fine-tuning approach using value surveys to modify LLM behavior.
	3. Empirical demonstration of value alignment in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

**Result:** Fine-tuning on value survey questions successfully changed model responses on in-domain queries and resulted in significant behavioral shifts in out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating a degree of value alignment in implicit tasks.

**Limitations:** The study's generalizability may be limited by the specific datasets used and the range of LLMs evaluated.

**Conclusion:** The simple approach of fine-tuning LLMs on value surveys is effective in altering both direct responses and broader behavioral patterns, indicating a viable method for steering model preferences.

**Abstract:** Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in implicit downstream task behavior.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Automated humor generation often fails due to lack of consideration for cultural background and context, leading to generic jokes.

**Method:** HumorPlanSearch incorporates a modular approach with Plan-Search for strategies, Humor Chain-of-Thought templates, a Knowledge Graph for historical strategy retrieval, novelty filtering, and a revision loop driven by human judges.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HumorPlanSearch for context-sensitive humor generation
	2. Development of Humor Generation Score (HGS) for evaluating comedic quality
	3. Integration of diverse techniques including Knowledge Graphs and iterative revision loops

**Result:** The HumorPlanSearch pipeline improves the Humor Generation Score by 15.4% over a strong baseline, indicating better context sensitivity and comedic quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By integrating contextual considerations throughout the humor generation process, HumorPlanSearch demonstrates significant advancements in AI-driven humor.

**Abstract:** Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score (HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates, and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13 human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent (p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

**TL;DR:** This study explores the challenges LLMs face in accurately classifying anti-sexist speech on social media, identifying critical misclassification errors that impact marginalized voices.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine the effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing between sexist, anti-sexist, and neutral content in political discourse and to address the implications of misclassification.

**Method:** The study analyzes the classification performance of five LLMs on political tweets related to high-profile events in the UK involving female Members of Parliament in 2022.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies misclassification of anti-sexist speech by LLMs.
	2. Highlights the dangers of binary moderation schemas in content moderation.
	3. Calls for integrating feminist scholarship into AI moderation practices.

**Result:** The analysis reveals that LLMs often misclassify anti-sexist speech as harmful, particularly during politically charged events, which can silence marginalized voices.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a specific set of political tweets and may not generalize to other contexts or types of speech.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a need for moderation designs to incorporate more nuanced categorization, human oversight during sensitive times, and the inclusion of counter-speech in model training.

**Abstract:** Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist, anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year 2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices. We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital political spaces.

**TL;DR:** CoDiEmb framework addresses negative transfer in text embeddings for Information Retrieval and Semantic Textual Similarity by decoupling task-specific learning signals and optimizing joint performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the issue of negative transfer when training a unified text embedding model for two distinct tasks: Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).

**Method:** Introduced CoDiEmb, which integrates task-specialized objectives, a delta-guided model fusion strategy, and a single-stage training pipeline to optimize performance across both tasks without gradient interference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a dynamic sampler for single-task batch formation
	2. Developed a delta-guided model fusion strategy for parameter optimization
	3. Implemented an efficient single-stage training pipeline

**Result:** CoDiEmb mitigates cross-task trade-offs and improves the geometric properties of the embedding space, as validated by extensive experiments on 15 standard benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework allows effective joint optimization for IR and STS, enhancing performance beyond traditional co-training methods.

**Abstract:** Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization, proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient, single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves the geometric properties of the embedding space.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Sentiment Analysis, Marketing Research, JSON Formatting, Contextual Reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study explores the impact of supplementary information format on sentiment analysis using LLMs, demonstrating that structured JSON prompts outperform natural language prompts without fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding consumer preferences through sentiment analysis is crucial for firms, and existing NLP studies often neglect the influence of additional reference points defined by marketing theories.

**Method:** The study compares the effectiveness of natural language and JSON-formatted prompts using a 3B parameter language model on two Yelp categories: Restaurant and Nightlife.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the effectiveness of JSON prompts in sentiment analysis using LLMs.
	2. Showed that structured prompts can outperform natural language prompts without fine-tuning.
	3. Highlighted the importance of contextual reasoning in sentiment analysis results.

**Result:** JSON prompts outperformed all baselines, improving Macro-F1 scores by 1.6% and 4%, and decreasing RMSE by 16% and 9.1%, indicating enhanced performance without fine-tuning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Structured prompting allows smaller models to achieve competitive performance in sentiment analysis, making it feasible for deployment in resource-limited environments.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields, including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

### [67] [Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11534)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** speciesism, large language models, AI ethics, animal rights, fairness in AI

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates speciesist bias in large language models (LLMs), examining their recognition and moral evaluation of speciesist statements while revealing mixed ethical stances on animal treatment.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To analyze the ethical tendencies of large language models concerning speciesism, reflecting on the significance of addressing biases in AI systems, particularly in relation to non-human animals.

**Method:** The research employs three paradigms: a benchmark (SpeciesismBench) with 1,003 items assessing speciesist statement responses, psychological measures comparing LLM and human responses, and text-generation tasks to evaluate elaboration on speciesist rationalizations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SpeciesismBench as a benchmark for evaluating speciesism in language models
	2. Findings indicating LLMs' mixed ethical views on speciesism
	3. Recommendations for enhancing AI fairness frameworks to address non-human animals

**Result:** LLMs reliably detect speciesist statements but rarely condemn them. They showed a mix of explicit speciesism lower than that of humans but preferred to save humans over multiple non-human animals; they rationalize harm toward farmed animals more than non-farmed animals.

**Limitations:** The study highlights the need for further research on the implications of these findings in real-world AI applications and the cultural contexts of speciesism.

**Conclusion:** LLMs reflect a blend of progressive and mainstream human views while reproducing entrenched cultural norms. The study emphasizes the need to expand AI fairness frameworks to include non-human moral considerations to reduce speciesist biases.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias -- discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1) SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals. These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes in AI systems and the societies they influence.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore how language models relate to brain representations of language and meaning, addressing challenges in cognitive science and neuroscience.

**Method:** The research examines brain activation levels during sentence processing and introduces a new measure of meaning consistency across different modalities using fMRI data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel metric for meaning consistency across modalities.
	2. Demonstrated the link between brain activation and language model predictions.
	3. Provided empirical evidence of cross-modal representation in language models.

**Result:** Results indicate that language models predict brain activity better in regions of consistent meaning representation, even when those regions are not primarily associated with language processing.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that language models may internally capture cross-modal conceptual meanings, providing insights for future research in cognitive science and AI.

**Abstract:** Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences, targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image) using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional clinician-based mental health assessments and improve the automation of psychological evaluation using AI.

**Method:** A multi-agent framework simulating doctor-patient dialogues with an adaptive questioning mechanism and tree-structured memory for dynamic information management.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation.
	2. Development of an adaptive questioning mechanism to enhance interaction.
	3. Implementation of a tree-structured memory for efficient data management.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance in mental health evaluation compared to existing static text analysis approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework offers an innovative solution for improving automated psychological assessments by facilitating deeper insights through interactive questioning and organization of user data.

**Abstract:** Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis, limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves better performance than existing approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework is effective for resource-limited settings and improves both efficiency and accuracy in large language models' reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism. These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16% accuracy improvement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The two-stage framework enhances speech representation learning, contributing to more efficient models for handling diverse speech-based applications.

**Abstract:** We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy. The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}. The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing visual entailment datasets are small and sparse, necessitating a more efficient method of data generation.

**Method:** A synthetic dataset is created using the SNLI dataset for textual entailment as prompts for a generative image model, Stable Diffusion, and evaluated both intrinsically and extrinsically.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a synthetic dataset for visual entailment
	2. Comparison of performance metrics with existing real datasets
	3. Evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of synthetic data in sparse data environments

**Result:** The synthetic data shows a slight drop in quality compared to real data, with an F-score of 0.686 on SNLI-VE and 0.384 on SICK-VTE, indicating potential in data-sparse settings.

**Limitations:** The synthetic dataset still results in a slight drop in performance compared to real data.

**Conclusion:** Synthetic data can serve as a viable alternative for training visual entailment models when real data is limited.

**Abstract:** In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically. For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for training visual entailment models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates significant advancements in personalized response generation quality by incorporating querier-specific data.

**Abstract:** Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLMs, but overlooked the diversity of queriers. In this work, we propose a new form of querier-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different queriers. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-querier general encoder and a querier-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same querier, while pulling apart those of different queriers. To mitigate the impact of query diversity on querier-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on query similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. To address the lack of datasets designed for querier-aware personalization, we also build a multi-querier dataset from English and Chinese scripts, as well as WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 queriers and 12 responders. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our design significantly improves the quality of personalized response generation, achieving relative improvement of 8.4% to 48.7% in ROUGE-L scores and winning rates ranging from 54% to 82% compared with various baseline methods.

In addition, we introduce a method of automatically constructing the corresponding benchmarks without requiring new human annotations. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with 16 representative LLMs as the evaluators based on our proposed framework, comprehensively analyzing their evaluation performance from different perspectives.

**Result:** Evaluation of 5 open-source and 3 proprietary multimodal language models shows that while images enhance generation, even the best models struggle with effective visual knowledge extraction and utilization.

**Limitations:** The benchmark primarily focuses on the visual component and may not cover other modalities or aspects of question answering comprehensively.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the necessity for advancements in visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution within multimodal retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a paradigm that augments large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge to tackle knowledge-intensive question answering. While several benchmarks evaluate Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) under Multimodal RAG settings, they predominantly retrieve from textual corpora and do not explicitly assess how models exploit visual evidence during generation. Consequently, there still lacks benchmark that isolates and measures the contribution of retrieved images in RAG. We introduce Visual-RAG, a question-answering benchmark that targets visually grounded, knowledge-intensive questions. Unlike prior work, Visual-RAG requires text-to-image retrieval and the integration of retrieved clue images to extract visual evidence for answer generation. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-source and 3 proprietary MLLMs, showcasing that images provide strong evidence in augmented generation. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle to efficiently extract and utilize visual knowledge. Our results highlight the need for improved visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution in multimodal RAG systems.

**Motivation:** To understand what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement in language models during reinforcement learning (RL) tasks.

**Method:** The authors analyze cognitive behaviors (verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, backward chaining) in language models; they conducted experiments comparing Qwen and Llama models under RL training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a framework to analyze cognitive behaviors in language models.
	2. Demonstrated that reasoning behaviors are essential for self-improvement in RL tasks.
	3. Showed that priming with reasoning behaviors can significantly enhance performance, regardless of correctness.

**Result:** Qwen-2.5-3B outperforms Llama-3.2-3B in RL tasks, especially after Llama is primed with reasoning behaviors, leading to significant performance improvements.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The presence of reasoning behaviors is crucial for models to improve; even incorrect solutions with proper reasoning patterns led to similar performance levels, and continued pretraining enhanced Llama's capabilities.

**Abstract:** Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Feather-SQL effectively enhances NL2SQL capabilities in small language models while ensuring data privacy.

**Abstract:** Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) has seen significant advancements with large language models (LLMs). However, these models often depend on closed-source systems and high computational resources, posing challenges in data privacy and deployment. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) struggle with NL2SQL tasks, exhibiting poor performance and incompatibility with existing frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce Feather-SQL, a new lightweight framework tailored for SLMs. Feather-SQL improves SQL executability and accuracy through 1) schema pruning and linking, 2) multi-path and multi-candidate generation. Additionally, we introduce the 1+1 Model Collaboration Paradigm, which pairs a strong general-purpose chat model with a fine-tuned SQL specialist, combining strong analytical reasoning with high-precision SQL generation. Experimental results on BIRD demonstrate that Feather-SQL improves NL2SQL performance on SLMs, with around 10% boost for models without fine-tuning. The proposed paradigm raises the accuracy ceiling of SLMs to 54.76%, highlighting its effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.
