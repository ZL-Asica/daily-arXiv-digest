  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of research on data preparation in data journalism, contrasting it with existing studies in data science workflows.

**Method:** The study uses a hybrid thematic analysis combining deductive and inductive coding from interviews with 36 professional data journalists.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel taxonomy for dirty data issues in journalism.
	2. Identification of four key challenges in data journalism's data preparation process.
	3. Extension of data science workflow models to include data preparation activities relevant to journalism.

**Result:** Identified 60 dirty data issues categorized into a new taxonomy, revealing discrepancies in mental models, along with four primary challenges journalists face: diachronic, regional, fragmented, and disparate data sources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper enhances understanding of data preparation in journalism and provides a framework to tackle data quality issues.

**Abstract:** The work involved in gathering, wrangling, cleaning, and otherwise preparing data for analysis is often the most time consuming and tedious aspect of data work. Although many studies describe data preparation within the context of data science workflows, there has been little research on data preparation in data journalism. We address this gap with a hybrid form of thematic analysis that combines deductive codes derived from existing accounts of data science workflows and inductive codes arising from an interview study with 36 professional data journalists. We extend a previous model of data science work to incorporate detailed activities of data preparation. We synthesize 60 dirty data issues from 16 taxonomies on dirty data and our interview data, and we provide a novel taxonomy to characterize these dirty data issues as discrepancies between mental models. We also identify four challenges faced by journalists: diachronic, regional, fragmented, and disparate data sources.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of current digital tools in supporting self-regulated learning (SRL) through Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL).

**Method:** The paper presents the lora Engine, which incorporates Generative AI features and learning analytics to provide adaptive, real-time support for learners' self-regulated learning activities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the lora Engine with Generative AI features.
	2. Development of instrumentation tools for dynamic scaffolding.
	3. Validation of the effectiveness of tools in educational contexts.

**Result:** The effectiveness of the lora Engine is validated through various research studies, demonstrating improvements in self-regulated learning and meaningful human-AI interactions in real-world contexts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The lora Engine represents a significant advancement in AI-enhanced learning, providing both theoretical and practical frameworks for supporting self-regulated learning.

**Abstract:** SRL, defined as learners' ability to systematically plan, monitor, and regulate their learning activities, is crucial for sustained academic achievement and lifelong learning competencies. Emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) developments profoundly influence SRL interactions by potentially either diminishing or strengthening learners' opportunities to exercise their own regulatory skills. Recent literature emphasizes a balanced approach termed Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL), in which AI provides targeted, timely scaffolding while preserving the learners' role as active decision-makers and reflective monitors of their learning process. Nevertheless, existing digital tools frequently fall short, lacking adaptability, focusing narrowly on isolated SRL phases, and insufficiently support meaningful human-AI interactions. In response, this paper introduces the enhanced \flora Engine, which incorporates advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) features and state-of-the-art learning analytics, explicitly grounded in SRL and HHAIRL theories. The \flora Engine offers instrumentation tools such as collaborative writing, multi-agents chatbot, and detailed learning trace logging to support dynamic, adaptive scaffolding tailored to individual needs in real time. We further present a summary of several research studies that provide the validations for and illustrate how these instrumentation tools can be utilized in real-world educational and experimental contexts. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of \flora Engine in fostering SRL and HHAIRL, providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions for the future of AI-enhanced learning context.

### [4] [ArchiveGPT: A human-centered evaluation of using a vision language model for image cataloguing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07551)

*Line Abele, Gerrit Anders, Tolgahan Aydın, Jürgen Buder, Helen Fischer, Dominik Kimmel, Markus Huff*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** vision language models, metadata generation, human-centered, AI integration, archival cataloguing

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study explores the effectiveness of vision language models in automating metadata generation for photographic collections, focusing on the quality of AI-generated descriptions compared to human-written ones.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rapid increase in photographic collections has outstripped the capacity for manual cataloguing, necessitating automation through AI.

**Method:** A vision language model (InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions which were then evaluated by experts and non-experts in a human-centered experimental setting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluated AI-generated descriptions in a real-world context of photographic cataloguing.
	2. Demonstrated classification performance insights and the limitations of AI in specialized domains.
	3. Proposed a framework for AI-human collaboration in content quality assurance.

**Result:** Participants classified AI-generated descriptions with performance above chance level, but overestimated their detection abilities; OCR errors and hallucinations impacted perceived quality.

**Limitations:** Reliance on human review needed to ensure accuracy due to technical limitations of the AI model.

**Conclusion:** AI can assist in generating catalogue descriptions, but human verification is essential, highlighting the importance of trust and collaboration between AI and experts in archival practices.

**Abstract:** The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM (InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools, emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance. These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and explainable AI pipeline.

### [5] [Conjugated Capabilities: Interrelations of Elementary Human Capabilities and Their Implication on Human-Machine Task Allocation and Capability Testing Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07560)

*Nils Mandischer, Larissa Füller, Torsten Alles, Frank Flemisch, Lars Mikelsons*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** human-autonomy interaction, conjugated capabilities, IMBA standard, task allocation, automation

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the concept of conjugated capabilities in human-autonomy interaction, aiming to enhance machine adaptability based on human performance metrics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study focuses on improving human and machine interactions by recognizing interrelated capabilities that can compensate for human limitations in tasks.

**Method:** The paper analyzes existing capabilities according to the IMBA standard and derives a network of interrelations among elementary capabilities through data from post-rehabilitation patients.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of conjugated capabilities in human-autonomy interaction.
	2. Development of a network representing interrelations of human capabilities.
	3. Application of findings in optimizing task allocation and IMBA test design.

**Result:** The analysis provides evidence for conjugated capabilities and demonstrates their application in optimizing IMBA test design, enhancing data recording processes.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited to specific contexts such as stationary manufacturing and post-rehabilitation scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that leveraging conjugated capabilities can facilitate better task allocation between humans and autonomous systems, leading to improved operational outcomes.

**Abstract:** Human and automation capabilities are the foundation of every human-autonomy interaction and interaction pattern. Therefore, machines need to understand the capacity and performance of human doing, and adapt their own behavior, accordingly. In this work, we address the concept of conjugated capabilities, i.e. capabilities that are dependent or interrelated and between which effort can be distributed. These may be used to overcome human limitations, by shifting effort from a deficient to a conjugated capability with performative resources. For example: A limited arm's reach may be compensated by tilting the torso forward. We analyze the interrelation between elementary capabilities within the IMBA standard to uncover potential conjugation, and show evidence in data of post-rehabilitation patients. From the conjugated capabilities, within the example application of stationary manufacturing, we create a network of interrelations. With this graph, a manifold of potential uses is enabled. We showcase the graph's usage in optimizing IMBA test design to accelerate data recordings, and discuss implications of conjugated capabilities on task allocation between the human and an autonomy.

### [7] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)

*Itay Itzhak, Yonatan Belinkov, Gabriel Stanovsky*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** cognitive biases, large language models, causal inference, finetuning, pretraining

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the sources of cognitive biases in large language models (LLMs) using a two-step experimental approach to distinguish between pretraining, finetuning, and randomness effects.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need to understand the origins of cognitive biases in LLMs to improve their fairness and decision-making capabilities in human-computer interaction.

**Method:** A two-step causal experimental approach: first, finetune models multiple times with different random seeds to assess training randomness on biases; second, use cross-tuning to swap instruction datasets between models to analyze bias sources.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a novel two-step causal experimental approach to study cognitive biases in LLMs.
	2. Demonstrated that biases are largely determined by pretraining rather than finetuning or random noise.
	3. Introduced the concept of cross-tuning to isolate bias sources between models.

**Result:** Findings show that while training randomness contributes to some variability in biases, the pretraining phase predominantly shapes bias patterns, indicating models with the same pretraining backbone share more similar biases.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on empirical findings from specific models and datasets, which may not generalize across all language models or contexts.

**Conclusion:** Future bias evaluations in finetuned models should consider their pretraining origins, providing a basis for developing effective bias mitigation strategies.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [8] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)

*Jens Rupprecht, Georg Ahnert, Markus Strohmaier*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, survey bias, response robustness, prompt design, synthetic data generation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social science surveys, revealing their vulnerabilities to response biases and perturbations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the reliability of LLMs as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys and to assess their susceptibility to response biases.

**Method:** The study tests nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey, applying 11 perturbations to question phrasing and answer option structure over 167,000 simulated interviews.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Revealed consistent recency bias in LLM responses
	2. Identified sensitivities of LLMs to semantic variations and perturbations
	3. Demonstrated alignment of LLM biases with known human survey response biases.

**Result:** All tested models exhibited a recency bias, favoring the last-presented answer, with larger models generally proving more robust but still sensitive to semantic variations and combined perturbations.

**Limitations:** The study's findings may vary across different contexts and with other LLMs not tested.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the need for careful prompt design and robustness testing when utilizing LLMs for synthetic survey data generation.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** synthetic text, privacy preservation, evaluation toolkit, healthcare, law

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** SynthTextEval is a toolkit for evaluating synthetic text across multiple dimensions to enhance privacy in AI systems.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enable principled evaluations of synthetic data in high-stakes domains, reducing privacy risks associated with AI systems.

**Method:** SynthTextEval allows users to evaluate synthetic text regarding utility, fairness, privacy risks, distributional differences, and expert feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a comprehensive evaluation toolkit for synthetic text
	2. Focus on high-stakes domains like healthcare and law
	3. Standardization of evaluation metrics for better privacy preservation

**Result:** The toolkit effectively consolidates evaluation metrics for synthetic data in fields such as healthcare and law.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By standardizing evaluation processes, SynthTextEval aims to enhance the viability of synthetic text and support privacy-preserving AI development.

**Abstract:** We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Medical Applications, Safety Evaluation, Red-Teaming, Health Informatics

**Relevance Score:** 10

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a safety evaluation protocol for large language models in the medical domain, addressing patient and clinician perspectives, and presents the PatientSafetyBench with 466 samples for assessing safety.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing use of LLMs in medicine necessitates a tailored safety evaluation due to their direct impact on human health, yet existing evaluations have focused primarily on general benchmarks.

**Method:** The authors developed a safety evaluation protocol specific to medical applications, implementing red-teaming techniques involving patient, clinician, and general user perspectives, and created the PatientSafetyBench for assessment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a safety evaluation protocol for medical LLMs.
	2. Creation of the PatientSafetyBench with 466 samples across critical categories.
	3. Application of targeted red-teaming methodologies for diverse user perspectives.

**Result:** The safety evaluation protocol highlighted critical safety issues in the MediPhi model collection and established a more focused criterion for evaluating medical LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methodology enhances safety evaluations in the medical domain and sets a precedent for systematic assessments of LLMs specifically tailored for healthcare.

**Abstract:** As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.

### [11] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)

*Mariah Bradford, Nikhil Krishnaswamy, Nathaniel Blanchard*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** interruption detection, collaborative learning, overlapping speech, AI in education, dialogue systems

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents an advanced method for detecting interruptions in multi-group dialogues, crucial for AI support in collaborative learning environments.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the monitoring of group interactions in classrooms and enhance the understanding of interruptions in collaborative learning settings.

**Method:** Analysis of interruption detection techniques in single and multi-group dialogues, followed by the development of a robust method for detecting interruptions in overlapping speech scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a state-of-the-art method for robust interruption detection in classrooms
	2. Provided insights into linguistic and prosodic cues for interruptions
	3. Paved the way for future research on overlapping speech in group dialogues

**Result:** The proposed method effectively identifies interruptions in collaborative group interactions, even when overlapping speech occurs, providing insights into linguistic and prosodic factors involved.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new approach facilitates better AI monitoring of classroom interactions, offering a foundation for further research into group dialogue tracking amid multiple conversations.

**Abstract:** Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context, overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

**Conclusion:** The study validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through ablation studies and human evaluations, showing significant enhancements in counterspeech quality.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality and obtains human preference.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiency of transformers in handling long text documents due to their quadratic computational complexity.

**Method:** The proposed model combines GNNs and CNNs with an end-to-end graph generation mechanism, processing character-level inputs in compact batches without padding or truncation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new model architecture combining GNNs and CNNs for text processing.
	2. Real-time graph generation mechanism that avoids padding and truncation.
	3. Efficient use of LLM information to enhance performance.

**Result:** The model demonstrates competitive performance across multiple text classification tasks while achieving efficiency in processing.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of local contextual patterns through CNNs, along with the use of LLMs, allows for enhanced text processing without sacrificing speed or efficiency.

**Abstract:** Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers, which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency, the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models. Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive performance.

**Abstract:** Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples). Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

**Abstract:** Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health (SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%), GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

**Conclusion:** The study shows that small language models can effectively interpret time series data, paving the way for on-device applications.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning - focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities. Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in natural language.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Agent Tuning, Action Deliberation, Reinforcement Learning, Interactive Agents

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework for fine-tuning Large Language Model agents, enabling them to deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one, resulting in a 20% performance improvement over existing methods.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the action selection process of LLM agents by allowing them to deliberate over multiple actions to avoid suboptimal decisions due to limited exploration.

**Method:** SAND employs self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to facilitate thoughtful action reasoning and deliberation before committing to a specific action, iteratively finetuning the LLM agent based on deliberation trajectories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SAND framework for LLM agents
	2. Implementation of self-consistency action sampling
	3. Use of execution-guided action critique for decision-making

**Result:** SAND achieves an average 20% improvement in performance over initial supervised finetuning and surpasses state-of-the-art agent tuning methods in two interactive agent tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of the SAND framework demonstrates significant gains in LLM performance by encouraging deliberation, making action selection more robust and optimal.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Addressing the instability and energy demands of reinforcement learning for large language models while enhancing accuracy and training efficiency.

**Method:** RLEP collects verified trajectories in a first phase and replays them during training, optimizing the policy on mini-batches that combine new rollouts with replayed high-quality examples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a two-phase RL framework
	2. Demonstrated faster convergence and better accuracy
	3. Publicly available resources for reproducibility

**Result:** RLEP demonstrates faster convergence and improved final performance on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model, enhancing accuracy on multiple benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The RLEP framework significantly improves reinforcement learning for language models, offering a reliable method for training with reduced updates and better outcomes.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%.

**Motivation:** To explore the phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and to provide a framework for better understanding and quantifying this issue.

**Method:** Development of the Bullshit Index metric and empirical evaluations on datasets including the Marketplace dataset and the Political Neutrality dataset, as well as a new benchmark designed to evaluate machine bullshit.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Bullshit Index metric
	2. Development of a taxonomy for four forms of machine bullshit
	3. Empirical evaluation on LLM behavior across multiple datasets

**Result:** Findings indicate that fine-tuning LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback exacerbates bullshit behavior, with specific forms amplifying under certain prompting conditions. We observed significant presence of machine bullshit in political discussions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights challenges in AI alignment and offers insights into improving the truthfulness of LLMs.

**Abstract:** Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

**TL;DR:** Introducing PLAN-TUNING, a framework that uses planning trajectories to enhance the performance and generalization of smaller LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of smaller open-source LLMs by utilizing planning structures seen in human-like natural planning, which have proven effective for larger models.

**Method:** PLAN-TUNING distills synthetic task decompositions from large LLMs and fine-tunes smaller models using supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives to replicate these planning processes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PLAN-TUNING framework
	2. Effective distillation of planning trajectories from large LLMs
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements on established reasoning benchmarks

**Result:** On benchmarks like GSM8k and MATH, plan-tuned models exceeded strong baselines by approximately 7%. Additionally, they demonstrated enhanced generalization on out-of-domain datasets, achieving around 10% and 12% performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The analysis indicates that planning trajectories contribute significantly to improving complex reasoning capabilities, validating PLAN-TUNING as an effective method for enhancing smaller LLMs' task-specific performances.

**Abstract:** Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii) fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$ performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

**Motivation:** To improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs while avoiding over-reliance on algorithmic patterns.

**Method:** TeaR uses careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide LLMs in discovering optimal reasoning paths for code-related tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TeaR for better reasoning in LLMs.
	2. Use of reinforcement learning in guiding reasoning paths.
	3. Extensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks showing improved performance.

**Result:** Significant performance improvements were recorded, with a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B across diverse benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TeaR demonstrates that LLMs can enhance reasoning abilities effectively through targeted learning approaches.

**Abstract:** Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuned domain-specific models for automated literature analysis in the context of ORR catalysts, indicating their potential for scalable applications.

**Abstract:** The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature, which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics (FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12 critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT for ORR catalyst extraction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifying the computational limits of LLMs in performing tasks
	2. Illustrating examples of LLMs' inability to verify complex information
	3. Discussing the implications of these limitations for real-world applications of LLMs

**Result:** The authors show that LLMs are unable to carry out tasks of a certain computational complexity and cannot verify the correctness of beyond a specific threshold of complexity, presenting practical examples.

**Limitations:** The exploration may not cover all types of tasks or complexities that LLMs could encounter in various applications.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the limitations of LLMs in both computational and agentic contexts, highlighting the need for careful consideration of their capabilities in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

**Motivation:** The increasing need for psychological support and the scarcity of relevant datasets in non-English languages necessitate new approaches to dialogue generation in therapy contexts.

**Method:** The framework utilizes limited real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models: Dialog Generator for creating structured dialogues and Dialog Modifier for refining them based on real data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of CPsDD with extensive dialogue records for psychological support.
	2. Introduction of a multi-component CADSS for analyzing user characteristics and generating responses.
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance in relevant dialogue tasks.

**Result:** The framework results in the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD) with 68K dialogues and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation tasks with the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue Support System (CADSS).

**Limitations:** The approach primarily focuses on Chinese language dialogues and may not generalize to other languages or cultural contexts without further adjustment.

**Conclusion:** The proposed system effectively leverages both generated and real-world data to enhance psychological support dialogues, setting a benchmark in non-English therapeutic dialogue generation.

**Abstract:** The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models: Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12 support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv datasets.

**Conclusion:** This research establishes the potential of VAP for effective turn-taking prediction in triadic dialogue and sets the stage for integration into spoken dialogue systems.

**Abstract:** Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into spoken dialogue systems.

**Conclusion:** LLMs with few-shot learning can be a strong alternative to fine-tuning methods in sentiment analysis when labeled data is limited or inconsistent, showcasing effectiveness across various languages.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset, likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies.

**Motivation:** To investigate retrieval challenges in cross-lingual RAG that are often obscured in previous work due to language imbalances and dataset limitations.

**Method:** The study utilizes benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets for systematic analysis of multilingual retrieval behavior across various language combinations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of multilingual retrieval behavior in a corporate context
	2. Identification of retrieval as a key bottleneck in cross-lingual RAG
	3. Proposed retrieval strategy that improves performance across languages

**Result:** The research identifies retrieval as a significant bottleneck, revealing major performance drops when query and document languages differ, and sees improvements with a new retrieval strategy that balances language sourcing.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the need for better multilingual retrieval strategies in practical RAG applications to enhance performance across languages.

**Abstract:** Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.   Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the interaction and effectiveness of post-training techniques in enhancing reasoning capabilities of vision-language models.

**Method:** Systematic analysis of performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks using long-CoT SFT and RL techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates the performance of long-CoT SFT and RL in VLMs
	2. Identifies trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length when combining methods
	3. Highlights the synergy dilemma in multimodal model training

**Result:** SFT improves structured reasoning on difficult questions but harms performance on simpler ones; RL enhances generalization and brevity but shows less improvement on harder questions; combined methods reveal trade-offs rather than additive benefits.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The combination of SFT and RL presents a synergy dilemma, indicating the need for more adaptive strategies in post-training methods for vision-language models.

**Abstract:** Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

**Conclusion:** The M4Doc framework effectively enhances translation performance while ensuring computational efficiency by bypassing the MLLM during inference.

**Abstract:** Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Bayesian, discrete-diffusion, language models, uncertainty estimation, ensemble methods

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper uncovers a Bayesian framework for discrete-diffusion language models, demonstrating that the output from a denoising process aligns with the posterior distribution over tokens, and presents an efficient ensemble method for improving token probability estimates at inference.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to expose a Bayesian foundation within discrete-diffusion language models to enhance performance and provide uncertainty estimates without extra training costs.

**Method:** The authors apply Monte Carlo marginalization over multiple independent corruptions to recover the posterior distribution and introduce an ensemble method that averages results of mask-and-denoise passes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Reveals a Bayesian core within discrete-diffusion language models.
	2. Introduces a lightweight inference-time ensemble method for improved token probability estimation.
	3. Achieves superior performance on WikiText-2 compared to existing models like GPT-2 Small.

**Result:** The proposed method demonstrates improved performance on WikiText-2 with a test perplexity of 8.8 using K=8, significantly outperforming GPT-2 Small at 20.3 perplexity, while maintaining a similar model size.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a viable approach to increasing the accuracy of language model outputs by leveraging a Bayesian framework and ensemble techniques without additional training.

**Abstract:** We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite using a model of comparable size. Code is available at https://github.com/mercury0100/bayesradd.

**Conclusion:** Knowledge Distillation, used alongside minimal prompting, enables the development of compact QA systems that maintain strong performance despite reduced resource footprints.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering (QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5 families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%. Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD, combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems suitable for resource-constrained applications.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the efficiency of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in answering complex questions using unstructured document corpora, demonstrating that improved prompting can enhance performance without large-scale fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the efficiency of retrieval processes in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for answering complex questions, as existing approaches have focused more on accuracy and recall rather than the number of retrieval searches.

**Method:** The authors compare a standard ReAct pipeline using improved prompts against state-of-the-art methods and analyze the impact of supervised and reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning on reducing the number of searches required during inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Showed that improved prompting can enhance RAG performance without large-scale fine-tuning.
	2. Achieved notable reductions in retrieval searches needed during inference while maintaining performance.
	3. Demonstrated that a standard ReAct pipeline can outperform state-of-the-art methods on QA benchmarks.

**Result:** The study shows that using better prompts can outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches on benchmarks like HotPotQA and that RL-based fine-tuning can reduce the number of retrieval searches needed, achieving competitive performance at a fraction of the cost.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on the efficiency of retrieval processes without extensive exploration of underlying model improvements or detailed analysis of prompt designs.

**Conclusion:** Improving prompts in RAG frameworks can lead to better performance without extensive fine-tuning, and efficiency can be enhanced with supervised and RL-based fine-tuning while maintaining competitive metrics.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The study introduces a taxonomy for Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) and evaluates LLMs on a dataset of phonetically cloaked offensive posts, revealing significant performance gaps in current models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of moderating toxic content in Chinese, which is hindered by Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) tactics employed by users.

**Method:** A four-way taxonomy of PCR was established, and a dataset of 500 real-world phonetically cloaked offensive posts was compiled for evaluation. Various state-of-the-art LLMs were benchmarked against this dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a comprehensive taxonomy of Phonetic Cloaking Replacement in Chinese content.
	2. Compiled and analyzed a dataset of naturally occurring phonetically cloaked offensive posts.
	3. Developed a lightweight prompting technique to improve detection accuracy of toxic content.

**Result:** The best performing model achieved an F1-score of 0.672, with performance deteriorating under zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting. A revised Pinyin-based prompting strategy improved accuracy despite prior evaluations deeming it ineffective.

**Limitations:** Results are based on a limited dataset from a single platform and may not generalize across all social media.

**Conclusion:** The work presents a new taxonomy for PCR, benchmarks existing detectors to highlight their inadequacies, and proposes a simple mitigation approach to enhance toxicity detection capabilities.

**Abstract:** Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized, existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring, phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness: the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

**Motivation:** To create an objective metric for summarization quality evaluation that reflects human perception without relying on lengthy human-generated references.

**Method:** NOIR uses language model-embedding to assess semantic similarity and evaluates the tradeoff between recall and compression in summarization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NOIR as an objective summarization evaluation metric.
	2. Demonstration of NOIR's effectiveness in capturing the summarization quality tradeoff.
	3. Application of NOIR to diverse summarization tasks.

**Result:** Experiments show NOIR effectively captures the token-length/semantic retention tradeoff and correlates with human evaluations of summarization quality.

**Limitations:** The reliance on language model embeddings may introduce biases based on the models used.

**Conclusion:** NOIR serves as an automated tool for assessing and improving summarization algorithms across various tasks.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality. Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and synthetically-generated summaries.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS) to enhance Transformer attention mechanisms by simulating larger head counts and dimensions while minimizing parameter overhead.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of multi-head attention by increasing heads and hidden sizes at minimal cost, thereby achieving greater expressiveness without expensive model sizes.

**Method:** The paper proposes a method called Simulated Attention Score (SAS) which projects low-dimensional head representations into higher-dimensional spaces, allowing for the simulation of higher attention capacity without increasing the parameter count.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Simulated Attention Score (SAS) methodology.
	2. Demonstration of improvements over existing attention variants.
	3. Proposal of Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) technique.

**Result:** SAS demonstrates significant performance improvements on various datasets compared to existing attention mechanisms, effectively balancing model size and performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed SAS and Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) show that it is possible to efficiently enhance attention mechanisms in Transformers without increasing the model size or parameter cost.

**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture. Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings, enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different attention variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the resource intensiveness of fine-tuning LLMs, there is a need for innovative frameworks that can expand knowledge effectively and efficiently, particularly under the limitations of traditional RAG implementations.

**Method:** K2RAG employs a combination of dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and a summarization step that preprocesses training data, aimed at enhancing retrieval quality and system efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of K2RAG framework for enhanced RAG implementation
	2. Integration of summarization step that reduces training time by 93%
	3. Demonstrated superior scalability with three times less VRAM usage compared to naive implementations.

**Result:** K2RAG outperformed naive RAG implementations, achieving a mean answer similarity score of 0.57 and a Q3 similarity of 0.82, along with a 93% reduction in training time and a 40% speed increase.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** K2RAG is a scalable and efficient framework that significantly reduces resource requirements and improves answer accuracy in knowledge retrieval for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the privacy-preserving assumption of text embeddings in NLP by verifying and extending the findings of the Vec2Text framework.

**Method:** We reproduce the Vec2Text framework and validate its findings through experiments, including a parameter sensitivity analysis and exploring embedding quantization as a defense.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Successful replication of Vec2Text's findings in various settings.
	2. Analysis of the sensitivity of input length on reconstruction effectiveness.
	3. Evaluation of quantization techniques as potential privacy defenses.

**Result:** The study confirms Vec2Text's effectiveness in reconstructing sensitive inputs and identifies limitations like susceptibility to input sequence length, while suggesting that quantization can reduce privacy risks.

**Limitations:** Sensitivity to input sequence length and dependence on model artifacts for successful replication.

**Conclusion:** Caution is needed when using text embeddings, and further research is necessary to develop robust privacy defense mechanisms for NLP applications.

**Abstract:** Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1) validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits. Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g., passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions, capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

**Abstract:** Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and distillation-based baselines.

**Conclusion:** This paper lays a foundational framework for integrating AI in legal processes and identifies future research directions, including ethical considerations and low-resource system deployment.

**Abstract:** This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval, prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal artificial intelligence.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** streaming speech translation, Large Speech-Language Model, speech Chain-of-Thought, policy decisions, translation generation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** StreamUni is a unified Large Speech-Language Model that addresses challenges in streaming speech translation by generating multi-stage outputs for speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation simultaneously.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve low latency and translation quality in streaming speech translation (StreamST) while overcoming limitations of existing sentence-level methods (SimulST).

**Method:** StreamUni employs a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) incorporating speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to generate multi-stage outputs which facilitate segmentation, policy decision-making, and translation in one process. It also introduces a streaming CoT training method.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a unified approach for streaming speech translation using LSLM.
	2. Introduces speech Chain-of-Thought for better policy decision-making and segmentation.
	3. Develops a novel streaming CoT training method for enhancing performance with limited data.

**Result:** Experiments show that StreamUni achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks, surpassing prior methods that require collaboration with segmentation models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By integrating speech CoT into the LSLM approach and employing a novel training method, StreamUni can effectively perform StreamST without extensive policy-specific training, achieving low latency and high-quality translations.

**Abstract:** Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality. However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method for inverting semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae using a Transformer-based model to facilitate continuous representations of logic in ML applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms via continuous representations of logic formulae that are semantically consistent and invertible.

**Method:** A Transformer-based decoder-only model is trained to invert semantic embeddings of STL formulae, utilizing a small vocabulary derived from STL syntax.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a Transformer-based model for inverting STL embeddings
	2. Demonstration of quick valid formula generation
	3. Application in requirement mining for classification tasks

**Result:** The proposed model generates valid formulae swiftly after training and generalizes effectively to the semantics of logic. It can decode embeddings into simpler formulae while retaining semantic equivalence to gold references.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The methodology is effective across various training complexities and contributes to advanced requirement mining tasks in classification based on semantic embeddings.

**Abstract:** Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space.

**Conclusion:** Strategies for minimizing repetitive outputs while preserving in-context learning capabilities are identified, offering insights for improving model outputs without sacrificing learning performance.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the relationship between large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as an enhanced approach to optimize the loss function in instruction tuning for language models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the optimization of the loss function used in instruction tuning, specifically evaluating the conventional approach of focusing only on response tokens while ignoring prompt tokens.

**Method:** Systematic investigation into the effect of different weights for prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, across various language models, datasets, and evaluation benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) methodology
	2. Extensive experimentation across multiple models and datasets
	3. Recommendations for optimizing instruction tuning loss through token weighting

**Result:** The study finds that differently weighting the tokens improves model performance, revealing that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens and a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best outcomes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings advocate for a reconsideration of the instruction tuning loss function, providing actionable insights for developing more robust language models.

**Abstract:** Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance cross-lingual semantic alignment in tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens from parallel data.

**Method:** The method learns a target tokenizer using a fixed source tokenizer, optimizing for semantic alignment in a cross-lingual context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of conditional unigram tokenization
	2. Evaluation across multiple language pairs and resource levels
	3. Insights into data efficiency bottlenecks in tokenization methods.

**Result:** The conditional tokenizer shows comparable statistical properties to standard unigram tokenizers but yields mixed results: no improvements in machine translation quality, yet consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling.

**Limitations:** Quadratic scaling of conditional probability estimation with respect to vocabulary size may limit data efficiency.

**Conclusion:** Data efficiency bottlenecks in conditional probability estimation suggest a need for alternative parameterizations for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

**Abstract:** We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of coreferential complexity in RAG systems that disrupt in-context learning and reduce performance in NLP tasks.

**Method:** Systematic investigation of entity coreference effects on document retrieval and generative performance, including comparative analysis of pooling strategies for retrieval tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the importance of coreference resolution in RAG systems.
	2. Showed the superior performance of mean pooling for context capturing after resolution.
	3. Identified that smaller models exhibit greater improvement from disambiguation.

**Result:** Coreference resolution significantly enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering performance, particularly benefiting smaller models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Understanding coreferential complexity provides insights for enhancing retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process, likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG, providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications.

**Read time:** 18 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To extend the Alpay Algebra framework and provide a formalized approach for the alignment process between AI systems and documents using semantic games.

**Method:** Development of a nested game-theoretic structure utilizing a composite operator for semantic convergence and local sub-game resolution, validated through fixed-point theory and categorical consistency tests.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a meta-game structure within the semantic game architecture.
	2. Proof of a Game Theorem regarding semantic equilibria and cognitive simulation.
	3. Development of a novel $i$-topology for addressing semantic singularities.

**Result:** Establishment of a Game Theorem that proves the existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under cognitive simulation assumptions, offering practical insights for AI alignment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework not only captures complex decision-making processes in AI but also ensures practical relevance through its grounding in category theory and cognitive science models.

**Abstract:** This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level. Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where $\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory, and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure mathematical abstraction.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current Conversational Health Agents lack adaptive multi-turn reasoning and effective decision-making capabilities, which limits their clinical applicability.

**Method:** The proposed framework, DocCHA, decomposes the diagnostic process into three stages: symptom elicitation, history acquisition, and causal graph construction, utilizing interpretable confidence scores for adaptive questioning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a modular framework for diagnostic conversations
	2. Improves diagnostic accuracy by 5.18% over existing LLM baselines
	3. Enhances symptom recall by over 30% with modest dialogue turns increase

**Result:** DocCHA outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving up to 5.18% higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30% improvement in symptom recall.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that DocCHA enables more structured and efficient diagnostic conversations, making it suitable for clinical environments, especially in multilingual and resource-limited contexts.

**Abstract:** Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning, prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.   Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX), DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations -- paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.

**Abstract:** Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files. Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of domain-specific knowledge and expert preferences significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of VLMs in industrial applications, making them more applicable for real-world anomaly detection tasks.

**Abstract:** While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses. To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

**TL;DR:** MIRIX is a modular, multi-agent memory system that enhances AI memory capabilities by integrating multiple memory types and enabling real-world personalized experiences.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing AI memory solutions, which are narrowly scoped and unable to perform complex memory tasks over time.

**Method:** MIRIX introduces six types of memory (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, Knowledge Vault) within a multi-agent framework for better memory management and retrieval.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-agent memory system
	2. Integration of diverse memory types
	3. Significant performance improvements in benchmarks

**Result:** MIRIX achieved 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline on ScreenshotVQA and state-of-the-art performance of 85.4% on LOCOMO, while drastically reducing storage needs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents and provides a user-friendly application for personalized memory experiences.

**Abstract:** Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [53] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** implicit reward model, explicit reward model, language models, generalization, superficial cues

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the generalization gap between implicit reward models (IM-RMs) and explicit reward models (EX-RMs) in language models, revealing that IM-RMs are more reliant on superficial token cues, leading to worse generalization under distribution shifts.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the underlying biases affecting the performance of IM-RMs versus EX-RMs, particularly the generalization gap during post-training and inference of language models.

**Method:** The paper employs theoretical exploration and experimental validation to analyze the differences in generalization behavior between IM-RMs and EX-RMs, focusing on their training conditions and reward computation methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies the reliance of IM-RMs on superficial token-level cues as a factor for their generalization gap.
	2. Challenges the assumption that IM-RMs are less effective in harder generative tasks.
	3. Demonstrates that minor architectural choices can lead to substantial differences in model behavior.

**Result:** The findings indicate that IM-RMs perform worse in generalization because they depend more on superficial token-level cues, which leads to poorer performance under token-level distribution shifts compared to EX-RMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that design choices in reward model architectures significantly impact generalization capabilities, emphasizing the importance of understanding these differences in model performance.

**Abstract:** Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Our evaluation shows that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

**Conclusion:** MedThink-Bench serves as a foundational tool for evaluating medical reasoning in LLMs, promoting their safe deployment in clinical environments.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.

**Conclusion:** Dynamic tooling in PyVision represents a significant advancement towards more agent-like capabilities in visual reasoning for MLLMs.

**Abstract:** LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the heuristics behind sampling behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that they parallel human decision-making processes, which has implications for bias and ethics in autonomous decision-making.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the heuristics guiding LLMs' decision-making processes and to assess their implications in real-world applications.

**Method:** The authors analyze sampling behaviors of LLMs in various real-world domains, comparing them to human decision-making heuristics through case studies and human studies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of the dual components (descriptive and prescriptive) in LLM decision-making that resemble human decision processes.
	2. Demonstration of how LLM concept prototypes are influenced by prescriptive norms.
	3. Analysis of ethical implications of biased decision-making in LLMs.

**Result:** The study finds that LLMs' sampling deviates from statistical norms toward prescriptive ideals, leading to biased decision-making in real-world scenarios.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on the conceptual framework and specific case studies, which may limit broad applicability to all LLMs and domains.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight significant ethical concerns regarding autonomy in decision-making when LLMs exhibit biased outputs influenced by prescriptive norms.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in autonomous decision-making, where they sample options from vast action spaces. However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the performance of four large language models in detecting dehumanizing language and reveals performance disparities across different target groups.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the growing need for detecting dehumanizing language, which is a harmful form of hate speech that normalizes violence against marginalized communities.

**Method:** The study systematically evaluates four state-of-the-art large language models (Claude, GPT, Mistral, and Qwen) for their ability to detect dehumanization in language, focusing on their performance metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic evaluation of multiple LLMs for dehumanization detection
	2. Identification of performance disparities among target groups
	3. Insights into the limitations of current hate speech detection methodologies.

**Result:** Claude achieves over 80% F1 score under optimized conditions, while the other models show moderate performance, particularly in distinguishing dehumanization from related hate types.

**Limitations:** The models show variable performance based on target identity, indicating potential biases; further annotation data for dehumanization detection is necessary.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of systematic, group-level evaluation in the application of pretrained language models for dehumanization detection, as there are significant disparities in how different identities are recognized.

**Abstract:** Dehumanization, i.e., denying human qualities to individuals or groups, is a particularly harmful form of hate speech that can normalize violence against marginalized communities. Despite advances in NLP for detecting general hate speech, approaches to identifying dehumanizing language remain limited due to scarce annotated data and the subtle nature of such expressions. In this work, we systematically evaluate four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) - Claude, GPT, Mistral, and Qwen - for dehumanization detection. Our results show that only one model-Claude-achieves strong performance (over 80% F1) under an optimized configuration, while others, despite their capabilities, perform only moderately. Performance drops further when distinguishing dehumanization from related hate types such as derogation. We also identify systematic disparities across target groups: models tend to over-predict dehumanization for some identities (e.g., Gay men), while under-identifying it for others (e.g., Refugees). These findings motivate the need for systematic, group-level evaluation when applying pretrained language models to dehumanization detection tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve cross-lingual smart customer service systems in FAQ dialogue scenarios by addressing the limitations of existing pre-trained models in capturing task-specific features in semantic retrieval.

**Method:** The authors introduce an Alternative Cross-lingual Pre-trained Model (PTM) for Semantic Retrieval through code-switching, implementing code-switched continual pre-training for enhanced task performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced code-switching approach for cross-lingual Semantic Retrieval.
	2. Developed code-switched continual pre-training methodology.
	3. Demonstrated improved performance on multiple datasets in diverse languages.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in SR and semantic textual similarity tasks across three business corpora and four open datasets encompassing over 20 languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that code-switching can significantly enhance the capability of cross-lingual PTMs in various semantic tasks, proving its utility in multilingual contexts.

**Abstract:** Semantic Retrieval (SR) has become an indispensable part of the FAQ system in the task-oriented question-answering (QA) dialogue scenario. The demands for a cross-lingual smart-customer-service system for an e-commerce platform or some particular business conditions have been increasing recently. Most previous studies exploit cross-lingual pre-trained models (PTMs) for multi-lingual knowledge retrieval directly, while some others also leverage the continual pre-training before fine-tuning PTMs on the downstream tasks. However, no matter which schema is used, the previous work ignores to inform PTMs of some features of the downstream task, i.e. train their PTMs without providing any signals related to SR. To this end, in this work, we propose an Alternative Cross-lingual PTM for SR via code-switching. We are the first to utilize the code-switching approach for cross-lingual SR. Besides, we introduce the novel code-switched continual pre-training instead of directly using the PTMs on the SR tasks. The experimental results show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous SOTA methods on SR and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks with three business corpora and four open datasets in 20+ languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rise of LLMs creates new challenges such as contamination, which affects model integrity and reliability in performance due to prior exposure to data.

**Method:** The paper reviews and analyzes recent work on contamination detection in LLMs, including various methodologies and their applications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive survey of contamination detection methodologies in LLMs.
	2. Analysis of use cases for contamination detection techniques.
	3. Attention to contamination bias in LLM evaluations.

**Result:** The survey highlights the lack of effective methods for detecting contamination and the implications for the reliability of LLM performance evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper calls for the NLP research community to systematically account for contamination bias when evaluating LLMs.

**Abstract:** With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, abundant new opportunities are emerging, but also new challenges, among which contamination is quickly becoming critical. Business applications and fundraising in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reached a scale at which a few percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes a major issue: LLMs' performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation jeopardizes real capability improvement in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of methods on how to efficiently detect contamination. In this paper, we survey all recent work on contamination detection with LLMs, analyzing their methodologies and use cases to shed light on the appropriate usage of contamination detection methods. Our work calls the NLP research community's attention into systematically taking into account contamination bias in LLM evaluation.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the context sensitivity of probes in large language models (LLMs) that predict the truth of sentences, examining how different contexts impact their outputs and suggesting these contexts can act as causal mediators in inference processes.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how context affects the predictions made by probes in LLMs, especially in light of their role in revealing models' beliefs about truth.

**Method:** The authors conducted experiments measuring consistency errors from probes that receive hypotheses followed by supporting and contradicting sentences, alongside a causal intervention experiment to test the influence of truth-value directions on sentence representations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of context-sensitive behavior in LLM probes.
	2. Demonstration of how outer context can influence the interpretation of truth in LLMs.
	3. Evidence that truth-value directions are causal mediators in inference processes.

**Result:** Probes are shown to be context-sensitive, with variations in error types depending on the LLM layer, model, and data type. Certain contexts that should not logically influence truth still affect the probe outputs.

**Limitations:** The results may vary with different models and types of data, indicating a potential limitation in generalizability.

**Conclusion:** Truth-value directions function as causal mediators during inference in LLMs, suggesting that understanding their sensitivity to context can improve the interpretation of model predictions.

**Abstract:** Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a novel tokenization method that preserves morphological structures in text inputs using a deep model, enhancing semantic retention compared to conventional methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Conventional statistical tokenizers disrupt word boundaries, corrupting semantic information, which motivates the need for a more effective tokenization approach that retains morphemes.

**Method:** The paper proposes a deep model that uses a mechanism called MorphOverriding to encode both internal structures and representations of words while inducing character-level structures based on morphological rules without annotated data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces MorphOverriding for maintaining morpheme integrity in tokenization
	2. Demonstrates superior performance over BPE and WordPiece methods
	3. Provides a self-supervised training approach for character-level structure induction

**Result:** The proposed method outperforms traditional tokenization methods like BPE and WordPiece in both morphological segmentation tasks and language modeling tasks, demonstrating superiority in retaining morphemes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This new approach to tokenization effectively enhances semantic information retention by keeping complete morphemes intact, thus improving language processing tasks.

**Abstract:** As a cornerstone in language modeling, tokenization involves segmenting text inputs into pre-defined atomic units. Conventional statistical tokenizers often disrupt constituent boundaries within words, thereby corrupting semantic information. To address this drawback, we introduce morphological structure guidance to tokenization and propose a deep model to induce character-level structures of words. Specifically, the deep model jointly encodes internal structures and representations of words with a mechanism named $\textit{MorphOverriding}$ to ensure the indecomposability of morphemes. By training the model with self-supervised objectives, our method is capable of inducing character-level structures that align with morphological rules without annotated training data. Based on the induced structures, our algorithm tokenizes words through vocabulary matching in a top-down manner. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method effectively retains complete morphemes and outperforms widely adopted methods such as BPE and WordPiece on both morphological segmentation tasks and language modeling tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand and improve the context faithfulness of LLMs when using external information for response generation.

**Method:** The study measures memory strength by quantifying the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question and examines LLM behavior with evidence presented in various styles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a new measure of memory strength in LLMs based on response divergence to paraphrased questions.
	2. Demonstrates the impact of paraphrased evidence presentation on LLM receptiveness.
	3. Provides insights for enhancing context-aware functionalities in LLMs.

**Result:** For high memory strength questions, LLMs tend to rely more on internal memory. Additionally, paraphrased evidence enhances receptiveness significantly compared to mere repetition or detailed additions.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on memory strength and does not explore other potential factors affecting LLMs' context faithfulness comprehensively.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight crucial factors influencing LLMs' context faithfulness and suggest improvements for retrieval-augmented generation methods.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information into the response generation process. However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details. These findings provide key insights for improving retrieval-augmented generation and context-aware LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/liyp0095/ContextFaithful.

**Abstract:** Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit limited ability to understand table structures and to apply precise numerical reasoning, which is crucial for tasks such as table question answering (TQA) and table-based fact verification (TFV). To address these challenges, we introduce our Tool-Augmented Reasoning framework for Tables (TART), which integrates LLMs with specialized tools. TART contains three key components: a table formatter to ensure accurate data representation, a tool maker to develop specific computational tools, and an explanation generator to maintain explainability. We also present the TOOLTAB dataset, a new benchmark designed specifically for training LLMs in table-tool integration. Our experiments indicate that TART achieves substantial improvements over existing methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) by improving both the precision of data processing and the clarity of the reasoning process. Notably, TART paired with CodeLlama achieves 90.0% of the accuracy of the closed-sourced LLM GPT-3.5-turbo, highlighting its robustness in diverse real-world scenarios.

### [67] [Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077)

*Zhipeng Wei, Yuqi Liu, N. Benjamin Erichson*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** LLMs, Jailbreaking, Emoji Attack, Token Segmentation Bias, Harmful Content Detection

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Introducing Emoji Attack, a method exploiting token segmentation bias in LLMs to reduce harmful content detection accuracy by leveraging emojis.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Jailbreaking techniques pose threats to LLMs by enabling harmful outputs, necessitating effective defenses.

**Method:** The paper explores the use of emojis as a novel way to exploit token segmentation bias by modifying text input before evaluation by Judge LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Emoji Attack for LLMs
	2. Demonstration of token segmentation bias impact on detection accuracy
	3. Empirical results showing reduced unsafe prediction rates in Judge LLMs

**Result:** Experiments show that Emoji Attack significantly reduces the rate of harmful content being detected by Judge LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Emoji Attack effectively bypasses safeguards of LLMs by introducing semantic ambiguity through emojis, lowering unsafe prediction rates.

**Abstract:** Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.

### [68] [Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC): A Theoretical and Computational Approach to Enhance Second Language Pronunciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10927)

*Jisang Park, Minu Kim, DaYoung Hong, Jongha Lee*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** L2 phonetics, phonological transfer, speech recognition, language learning, phoneme reconstruction

**Relevance Score:** 3

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a method to improve second language pronunciation by reconstructing L2 phonemes using L1 phonemes, resulting in a 20% improvement in speech recognition accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Learners often struggle with L2 pronunciation due to the influence of their native language, leading to incorrect phonemic transfer that affects speech recognition.

**Method:** A novel computational method called Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC) is proposed, which reconstructs L2 phonemes from multiple L1 phonemes to minimize incorrect phonological transfer.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC) method
	2. Demonstrated improvement in automatic speech recognition for L2 phonemes
	3. Rapid acquisition of composite phonetic sounds in learners

**Result:** Tests showed a 20% improvement in the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes when L2 speakers used IPC-generated composite sounds compared to original pronunciation patterns.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The IPC method significantly enhances the accuracy of L2 pronunciation and shows rapid acquisition of the composite sounds generated.

**Abstract:** Learners of a second language (L2) often unconsciously substitute unfamiliar L2 phonemes with similar phonemes from their native language (L1), even though native speakers of the L2 perceive these sounds as distinct and non-interchangeable. This phonemic substitution leads to deviations from the standard phonological patterns of the L2, creating challenges for learners in acquiring accurate L2 pronunciation. To address this, we propose Inter-linguistic Phonetic Composition (IPC), a novel computational method designed to minimize incorrect phonological transfer by reconstructing L2 phonemes as composite sounds derived from multiple L1 phonemes. Tests with two automatic speech recognition models demonstrated that when L2 speakers produced IPC-generated composite sounds, the recognition rate of target L2 phonemes improved by 20% compared to when their pronunciation was influenced by original phonological transfer patterns. The improvement was observed within a relatively shorter time frame, demonstrating rapid acquisition of the composite sound.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Chain-of-Thought, Large Language Models, Information Gain, Evaluation Techniques, Reasoning Assessment

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for evaluating Chain-of-Thought reasoning in Large Language Models, enabling the identification of failure modes without requiring annotated datasets.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for evaluating CoT reasoning are either dependent on annotated data or ineffective in assessing intermediate reasoning, which can yield false positives.

**Method:** The proposed framework quantifies the 'information-gain' at each reasoning step, facilitating a more robust evaluation of the reasoning process in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces an information-theoretic framework for CoT evaluation.
	2. Quantifies information gain at each reasoning step.
	3. Demonstrates improved evaluation accuracy over existing methods.

**Result:** The method significantly outperforms traditional outcome-based evaluation techniques, providing clearer insights into model performance on subtasks across various datasets.

**Limitations:** The approach may still be limited by the inherent complexities of reasoning tasks and does not address all potential evaluation metrics.

**Conclusion:** The study validates that the information-theoretic approach effectively enhances the evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities without relying on costly annotations.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks through the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, allowing models to break down problems into manageable sub-tasks. However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information-gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy arithmetic, GSM8K and PRM800k datasets, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual subtasks.

**TL;DR:** SpeechSSM is a novel generative model for long-form speech that significantly improves coherence and efficiency over previous models by generating speech without text intermediates.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing textless spoken language models in generating coherent long-form speech beyond short durations.

**Method:** SpeechSSMs utilize linear-time sequence modeling to learn from and generate long-form spoken audio in a single decoding session, while introducing LibriSpeech-Long for evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SpeechSSM for long-form speech generation without text intermediates
	2. Development of the LibriSpeech-Long benchmark for evaluating long-form speech
	3. Proposal of new metrics for quality measurement in long-form speech generation

**Result:** SpeechSSMs outperform current Transformer models in generating multi-minute speech while matching them at the utterance level, demonstrating significant improvements in coherence and efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of SpeechSSM and the LibriSpeech-Long benchmark represents a substantial advancement in the field of generative spoken language modeling, particularly for long-form audio generation.

**Abstract:** We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, evaluative processes, human judgments, expert ratings, contextual reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform evaluative processes compared to human judgments and expert ratings, revealing significant differences in mechanisms and implications for judgment automation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to understand how LLMs handle evaluations, the assumptions behind these evaluations, and their divergence from human strategies is crucial as LLMs are increasingly used in evaluative contexts.

**Method:** Benchmarking six LLMs against expert ratings and human judgments through a structured framework where LLMs and human participants followed the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A structured agentic framework for LLMs and human evaluations
	2. Insights into the mechanisms used by LLMs versus humans
	3. Identification of systematic effects due to LLM evaluation strategies

**Result:** LLMs showed output alignment with human evaluations but relied on lexical associations and statistical priors instead of contextual reasoning, leading to political asymmetries and opaque justifications.

**Limitations:** The study's sample size and selection of LLMs may limit the generalizability of findings.

**Conclusion:** Automating evaluation with LLMs changes the nature of evaluation itself, moving from normative reasoning to a reliance on pattern-based approximation.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in workflows that involve evaluative processes. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and non-expert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, LLMs rely on different mechanisms: lexical associations and statistical priors replace contextual reasoning. This reliance produces systematic effects: political asymmetries, opaque justifications, and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic validity. Delegating judgment to such systems does not merely automate evaluation--it redefines it, shifting from normative reasoning to pattern-based approximation.

**TL;DR:** Examines LLMs' ability to judge celebrity reputations as good or evil using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methodology.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate if large language models can effectively assess the good/evil reputation of celebrities based on online content.

**Method:** Utilized ChatGPT to collect and categorize sentences related to celebrity reputation from web articles, then applied RAG to evaluate these reputations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a new approach for assessing celebrity reputations using LLMs and RAG.
	2. Validated the effectiveness of LLMs in categorizing and judging reputations based on online articles.
	3. Established a comparative analysis against existing RAG services.

**Result:** Showed that the method significantly outperforms existing services using RAG for judging celebrity reputations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method demonstrates better effectiveness in analyzing celebrity reputations compared to current solutions.

**Abstract:** The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs) can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.
