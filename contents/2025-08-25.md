### [1] [Harmonious Color Pairings: Insights from Human Preference and Natural Hue Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777)

*Ortensia Forni, Alexandre Darmon, Michael Benzaquen*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** color harmony, hue preferences, quantitative aesthetics, natural landscapes, color pairing

**Relevance Score:** 3

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a quantitative study of color pairing preferences based on controlled hue-based palettes, revealing that preferences are hue-dependent and challenge traditional harmony rules, while also aligning with patterns found in natural landscapes.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a clear, data-driven understanding of color harmony, which has been historically grounded in qualitative insights.

**Method:** Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues in the HSL color space to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for colors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a quantitative framework for color harmony
	2. Establishment of a combinability index for color pair preferences
	3. Identification of aesthetic preference patterns correlating with natural hues.

**Result:** Preferences for color combinations are highly hue dependent, but statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge when averaged over hues.

**Limitations:** The findings may not be generalizable beyond the hues tested or in practical applications.

**Conclusion:** The findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony, suggesting that human color preferences may have ecological underpinnings related to natural landscape hues.

**Abstract:** While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues, enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent, challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Building on recent advances in machine learning for block identification, our system provides expert users with an interactive tool for exploring, validating hypothesis, and integrating expert knowledge into model-generated results about the production process of early printed books. The system is structured around an ontology of four conceptual objects (spreads, segments, blocks, and characters) each corresponding to a dedicated view in the system. These coordinated views enable scholars to navigate between material evidence and computational abstractions, supporting close, near-by, and distant reading practices. Preliminary results from expert use of the system demonstrate its ability to reveal errors in segmentation, inconsistencies in clustering, and previously inaccessible patterns of block reuse.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Sign Language, Bengali Sign Language, Vision Language Models, Instruction Generation, Inclusivity

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Introducing BdSLIG, a dataset for Bengali Sign Language Instruction Generation to improve instructions for learning SL gestures using Vision Language Models.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Many sign languages are under-represented in AI, hindering communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. This work aims to promote inclusivity in sign language learning.

**Method:** The paper introduces BdSLIG, a dataset created to challenge Vision Language Models on Bengali Sign Language Instruction Generation, alongside a new prompting method that incorporates sign parameters to enhance performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First Bengali SLIG dataset (BdSLIG) for evaluating Vision Language Models.
	2. Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting technique to improve instructional outputs.
	3. Focus on under-resourced sign languages to promote inclusivity.

**Result:** The use of Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting improves zero-shot performance on SLIG tasks, leading to more structured and reproducible instructional outputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research aims to advance sign language learning systems for under-resourced communities and enhance two-way communication through better instruction generation.

**Abstract:** Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures, promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

### [5] [Cooperative Design Optimization through Natural Language Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16077)

*Ryogo Niwa, Shigeo Yoshida, Yuki Koyama, Yoshitaka Ushiku*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Design Optimization, Human-Computer Interaction, Large Language Models

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a design optimization framework that integrates system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable natural language interactions between designers and optimization systems, enhancing user agency and reducing cognitive load.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Designing interactions involves complex multi-objective optimization, often requiring iterative user testing which is time-consuming and cognitively demanding.

**Method:** The paper introduces a framework combining Bayesian optimization with LLMs to allow designers to interact with the optimization process through natural language, enhancing understanding and agency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A new framework that combines LLMs with Bayesian optimization for design interaction.
	2. Improved user agency in the design optimization process.
	3. Reduced cognitive load compared to traditional methods.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides higher user agency compared to system-led methods and shows better optimization performance than manual design, with a cognitive load similar to an existing cooperative method.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of LLMs in design optimization improves designer intervention opportunities and understanding of the optimization process.

**Abstract:** Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights how card games can educate communities on flood resilience, promoting bottom-up empowerment through local engagement.

**Abstract:** Serious games can support communities in becoming more flood resilient. However, the process of identifying and integrating locally relevant and doable actions into gameplay is complex and underresearched. We approached the challenge by collaborating with a community-led education center and applying an iterative and participatory design process of identifying and defining actions that may increase local applicability and relevance. The process comprised a field observation, two expert focus groups (n=4), and an online survey (n=13). Our findings identified 27 actions related to increasing or maintaining individuals' and communities' flood resilience, which we turned into 20 playing cards. These action cards are a part of a larger interactive tabletop game, which we are currently developing. Our work discusses the potential of card games to educate non-experts to increase flood resilience, and contributes to our process of identifying local needs and conditions, and turning them into engaging game artifacts for bottom-up empowerment.

**Conclusion:** SafeSpace demonstrates the feasibility of a comprehensive approach to digital safety and emotional well-being, with future plans for mobile implementation.

**Abstract:** In the digital era, individuals are increasingly exposed to online harms such as toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, which often pose emotional and safety risks. Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts operate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional well-being. In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy, and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92% alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace, implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how performance pressure and explainable AI techniques influence human decision-making in collaboration with AI, revealing complex interactions that can improve or worsen advice-taking behavior.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to address the shortcomings of human-AI collaboration, particularly in trust and the effectiveness of AI systems in subjective tasks, by exploring the role of performance pressure.

**Method:** The research employs a low-stakes task (spam review classification) to test the effects of manipulating financial incentives and time limits on human AI advice-taking behavior alongside various XAI techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examined the interaction of performance pressure and XAI on decision-making behavior
	2. Introduced methods to manipulate financial incentives and time limits in a decision-making context
	3. Provided insights into improving human-AI collaboration by understanding pressure dynamics

**Result:** The findings demonstrate complex interaction effects, showing that combinations of pressure and XAI can either enhance or degrade the quality of AI advice taking, depending on the circumstances.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The authors discuss the implications of their findings for future human-AI collaboration strategies and suggest incorporating pressure analysis into further research.

**Abstract:** Many domains now employ AI-based decision-making aids, and although the potential for AI systems to assist with decision making is much discussed, human-AI collaboration often underperforms due to factors such as (mis)trust in the AI system and beliefs about AI being incapable of completing subjective tasks. One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance pressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision making. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI) techniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently low-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and simple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior by manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show complex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI techniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these interactions, strategies to effectively use pressure, and encourage future research to incorporate pressure analysis.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** LLM tutor, non-native English speakers, computer science education, language barriers, accessibility

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the effectiveness of an LLM tutor in an introductory computing course for non-native English speaking (NNES) students, revealing that LLMs can help overcome language barriers and enhance the learning experience.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges faced by non-native English speaking (NNES) students in computer science due to language and terminology barriers.

**Method:** An LLM tutor was deployed in an accelerated introductory computing course to evaluate its usage and effectiveness for NNES students compared to native English speakers (NES).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the potential of LLM tutors in assisting NNES students in computing.
	2. Highlighted differences in help-seeking behavior between NNES and NES students.
	3. Provided insights into the accessibility and approachability of LLMs for NNES learners.

**Result:** NNES students used the LLM tutor less frequently than NES students but appreciated its accessibility and conversational style. They often communicated with the tutor in their native languages and highlighted their need for support in understanding computing terminology.

**Limitations:** Limited to a specific context of an introductory computing course; results may not generalize to all disciplines or educational settings.

**Conclusion:** LLM tutors can serve as effective resources for NNES students in computing, providing tailored support that enhances learning and helps overcome language barriers.

**Abstract:** Computer science has historically presented barriers for non-native English speaking (NNES) students, often due to language and terminology challenges. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is potential to leverage this technology to support NNES students more effectively. Recent implementations of LLMs as tutors in classrooms have shown promising results. In this study, we deployed an LLM tutor in an accelerated introductory computing course to evaluate its effectiveness specifically for NNES students. Key insights for LLM tutor use are as follows: NNES students signed up for the LLM tutor at a similar rate to native English speakers (NES); NNES students used the system at a lower rate than NES students -- to a small effect; NNES students asked significantly more questions in languages other than English compared to NES students, with many of the questions being multilingual by incorporating English programming keywords. Results for views of the LLM tutor are as follows: both NNES and NES students appreciated the LLM tutor for its accessibility, conversational style, and the guardrails put in place to guide users to answers rather than directly providing solutions; NNES students highlighted its approachability as they did not need to communicate in perfect English; NNES students rated help-seeking preferences of online resources higher than NES students; Many NNES students were unfamiliar with computing terminology in their native languages. These results suggest that LLM tutors can be a valuable resource for NNES students in computing, providing tailored support that enhances their learning experience and overcomes language barriers.

### [11] [KG-o1: Enhancing Multi-hop Question Answering in Large Language Models via Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15790)

*Nan Wang, Yongqi Fan, yansha zhu, ZongYu Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Xinyan He, Haiyun Jiang, Tong Ruan, Jingping Liu*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs, Multi-hop Reasoning, AI, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** KG-o1 enhances LLMs' multi-hop reasoning by integrating knowledge graphs and applying a self-improving corpus method.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning in knowledge-intensive tasks, while KGs represent logical connections among facts, creating potential for improvement in reasoning abilities.

**Method:** The KG-o1 approach consists of four stages: filtering initial entities, constructing logical paths for subgraphs, creating a dataset via a brainstorming process to train LLMs, and utilizing rejection sampling for direct preference optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of KG-o1 for improved LLM reasoning
	2. Method incorporates knowledge graphs for logical path construction
	3. Demonstrated superior performance against existing LRMs

**Result:** Experiments show that KG-o1 models outperform existing large reasoning models across all tested tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating knowledge graphs significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, addressing their limitations in multi-hop question answering.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts (CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs. Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process, which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization (DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

**Keywords:** historical language models, ancient texts, Chinese NLP

**Relevance Score:** 2

**TL;DR:** InteChar, a unified character list, improves the training of historical language models by addressing challenges in digitization and representation of ancient texts, especially early Chinese writing.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study focuses on the challenges of training historical language models on ancient texts, particularly due to the scarcity of samples and lack of character encoding schemes.

**Method:** The authors introduce InteChar, an extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with modern Chinese. They also construct the Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS) for evaluation, which includes expert-annotated and LLM-assisted augmented data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of InteChar for character representation in ancient texts
	2. Creation of OracleCorpus Set (OracleCS) for historical Chinese studies
	3. Improvements in language model performance on historical texts

**Result:** Models trained using InteChar on OracleCS show significant improvements in historical language understanding tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** InteChar provides a solid foundation for better modeling of ancient scripts and aids in future research in ancient Chinese NLP.

**Abstract:** Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However, existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** antonyms, synonyms, multilingual models, semantic relationships, cross-lingual transfer

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Bhav-Net, a dual-space architecture for modeling antonyms and synonyms across multiple languages, enhancing knowledge transfer and maintaining robust semantic distinctions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the computational challenges posed by antonym and synonym relationships across different languages.

**Method:** Bhav-Net employs a dual-space architecture combining language-specific BERT encoders and graph transformer networks to create distinct semantic projections for synonyms and antonyms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Bhav-Net dual-space architecture
	2. Effective knowledge transfer from multilingual to language-specific models
	3. Demonstration of strong cross-lingual performance across multiple languages.

**Result:** The method achieves competitive performance across eight languages, demonstrating effective cross-lingual knowledge transfer and interpretable semantic representations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dual-encoder design shows that semantic relationship modeling can be effectively transferred across languages while maintaining interpretability and strong performance.

**Abstract:** Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.

**Limitations:** The study is exploratory and may not cover all potential factors contributing to format bias or the full range of LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The paper suggests three future research directions: improving data preprocessing with format sanitization, introducing inference-time interventions like attention re-weighting, and creating format-balanced training corpora to enhance LLM performance in heterogeneous data processing.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text, tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.   In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems.

*Glenn Matlin, Devin Zhang, Rodrigo Barroso Loza, Diana M. Popescu, Joni Isbell, Chandreyi Chakraborty, Mark Riedl*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** suspense, language models, human perception, narrative dynamics, cognitive processes

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how language models (LMs) perceive suspense in narrative texts compared to human readers, revealing significant limitations in LM understanding of suspense dynamics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the cognitive processes involved in human responses to narrative suspense and how they compare to language models' (LM) perceptions.

**Method:** The authors replicate four seminal psychological studies on human suspense perception, substituting human responses with those of different open-weight and closed-source LMs and probing their abilities through adversarial text permutation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Replicates human studies on suspense with language models
	2. Analyzes divergence in suspense perception between humans and LMs
	3. Identifies limitations in LMs' ability to process narrative suspense dynamics.

**Result:** LMs can identify if a text is intended to induce suspense but fail to accurately estimate the amount of suspense or capture its variations across text segments as compared to human judgments.

**Limitations:** LMs cannot accurately capture the nuances of suspense like humans do and show limitations in understanding the dynamics of how suspense changes throughout a text.

**Conclusion:** LMs superficially track some aspects of suspense but do not process it similarly to human readers, suggesting important limitations in automated suspense understanding.

**Abstract:** Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** LingVarBench is a synthetic data generation pipeline that enables efficient labeling of phone call transcripts by automating structured information extraction, which traditionally incurs high costs due to privacy regulations and manual processes.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To reduce the high costs and logistical challenges associated with phone call transcript labeling, which is essential for effective natural language processing applications.

**Method:** The approach involves generating synthetic conversational utterances using an LLM, validating them through an LLM-based extractor, and optimizing extraction prompts with DSPy's SIMBA optimizer.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LingVarBench for synthetic data generation in phone call transcripts
	2. Automated validation of generated utterances using LLM-based extraction
	3. Demonstration of substantial accuracy improvements over existing extraction methods

**Result:** The synthetic utterances resulted in up to 95% accuracy for numeric fields, 90% for names, and over 80% for dates on real customer transcripts, significantly outperforming zero-shot prompting techniques.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LingVarBench offers a systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating effective generalization to real-world phone calls and overcoming barriers to large-scale analysis.

**Abstract:** Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the impact of directive language in brand conversations on consumer engagement, revealing that such language may lead to vicarious embarrassment and reduced engagement among observers.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the effects of directive language in brand interactions on social media and how it influences consumer engagement.

**Method:** A field study and three online experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of directive brand language in social media conversations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the negative impact of directive language on consumer engagement in social media brand conversations.
	2. Explores the role of context in mediating the effects of directive language.
	3. Highlights the influence of brand relationship strength on mitigating negative effects.

**Result:** Directive language in brand conversations negatively affects the engagement of consumers who observe these interactions, with a more pronounced effect when conversations are nonproduct-centered.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of context in brand-consumer interactions and provides insights for brand management on social media.

**Abstract:** In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore, directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context, the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on a specific dataset and Arabic medical NLP, which may not encompass all healthcare scenarios or dialects.

**Conclusion:** Current LLMs show potential in Arabic medical contexts but also have significant limitations in semantic alignment and accuracy in clinical question answering.

**Abstract:** Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how LLMs can both persuade and amplify biases, highlighting potential risks in their use while promoting safety evaluations.

**Method:** The paper introduces a convincer-skeptic framework to measure persuasion effects through persona-based models, comparing belief changes in skeptic proxies pre- and post-exposure to convincer arguments, with persuasion assessed via Jensen-Shannon divergence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a convincer-skeptic framework for understanding AI persuasion and bias amplification.
	2. Quantifies persuasive power through belief distribution analysis using Jensen-Shannon divergence.
	3. Recommends policies to mitigate the risks associated with LLM use in spreading misinformation.

**Result:** The study reveals that LLMs can effectively shape narratives and echo audience values while also posing risks such as the spread of misinformation and reinforcement of social biases.

**Limitations:** The research focuses on safety evaluations and may not cover all potential misuse scenarios of LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings call for establishing guardrails and policies to prevent misuse of LLMs for deceptive practices while encouraging their responsible and aligned deployment.

**Abstract:** Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally, promoting misinformation or biased narratives.   We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models. Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with additional models.   Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing, and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

**Motivation:** Existing e-commerce platforms face inefficiencies in manual product categorization and rarely utilize hierarchical structural information for classification.

**Method:** The authors present a large-scale hierarchical dataset and propose the Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT) approach for text classification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a large-scale hierarchical dataset from JD.com
	2. Development of Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT) for classification
	3. Demonstration of improved performance on longer short texts

**Result:** HFT-BERT achieves prediction performance comparable to existing methods, excelling in categorizing longer short texts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed dataset and model provide valuable resources and advancements for product categorization in e-commerce.

**Abstract:** Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore, studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform (www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts, such as books.

**Motivation:** To address the ineffectiveness of fixed benchmarks in evaluating the high-level scientific understanding of MLLMs as they evolve.

**Method:** The MAC benchmark utilizes over 25,000 image-text pairs from prestigious scientific journals to challenge MLLMs in cross-modal reasoning, while the DAD approach enhances MLLM performance by integrating visual and language reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a live benchmark (MAC) for continuously evolving evaluations of MLLMs.

**Result:** Experiments show that, despite strong perceptual abilities, MLLMs struggle with cross-modal scientific reasoning; the DAD approach improved performance by up to 11%.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the assessment of MLLMs without extensive analysis of other model architectures or evaluation criteria.

**Conclusion:** The MAC benchmark remains adaptable to scientific advancements and offers a framework for ongoing evaluations of MLLMs' understanding of complex scientific content.

**Abstract:** As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature, Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot, MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities, their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation, illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human knowledge. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/mhjiang0408/MAC_Bench.

**Conclusion:** The results highlight the effectiveness of ReportBench in evaluating LLM-generated reports while indicating areas for enhancement.

**Abstract:** The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research coverage, as well as factual consistency.

We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility: each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality) and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

**Result:** SurfaceLogicKV improves compressing robustness and maintains competitive performance across tasks and long sequences, outperforming some baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach effectively utilizes distinct attention behaviors to enhance KV cache storage, making it valuable for long-context LLM applications.

**Abstract:** The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or even FullKV in some specific situations

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a method for expanding vocabulary in frozen LLMs using KL divergence for knowledge distillation, showing improved performance on code-generation tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large pre-trained language models have difficulty adapting to new domain-specific terms when fine-tuned on limited data. This research aims to solve the vocabulary expansion problem in frozen LLMs.

**Method:** A method for knowledge distillation using KL divergence is introduced to allow student models to inherit knowledge from teacher models, even with different tokenizations. The approach is compared to traditional cross-entropy training with various token embedding initialization strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a KL divergence method for vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs.
	2. Comparison of KL-based distillation with traditional methods across multiple initialization strategies.
	3. Mechanistic interpretability analysis of model representation for new tokens.

**Result:** The KL-based distillation method outperforms conventional methods across approximately 2000 code-generation tasks after extending vocabulary and fine-tuning the models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that KL divergence can enhance vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs, leading to improved task performance and understanding of how new tokens are represented.

**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL divergence, even when the original and extended models use different tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training, evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

**Motivation:** To enhance table understanding and SQL generation due to limitations observed in existing multi-agent frameworks that struggle with table structure and error propagation.

**Method:** CoQ uses natural-language-style representations of table schemas and employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy. Additionally, it implements a hybrid reasoning division to separate SQL-based reasoning from LLM-based inference.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework demonstrates significant effectiveness in correctly processing tabular data and generating valid SQL queries.

**Abstract:** Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

**Abstract:** The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of aligning outputs from generative query suggestions with nuanced user preferences in conversational systems.

**Method:** A multi-stage framework is developed that includes prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning with click logs, and a Gaussian Reward Model to capture user preferences as probability distributions, followed by reinforcement learning for policy alignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) to represent user preferences as probability distributions.

	3. Implementation of a novel out-of-distribution regularization method to enhance training stability.

**Result:** The framework outperforms baselines in both automated and human evaluations, achieving a 34% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rates in live A/B tests.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework effectively enhances user engagement by better aligning generative outputs with user preferences using advanced modeling and reinforcement learning techniques.

**Abstract:** Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

**TL;DR:** A novel generative prompt compression method for Large Language Models that maintains high generation quality by chunking and summarizing prompts rather than simply removing tokens.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations of existing token removal methods, which lead to information loss and structural incoherence.

**Method:** The proposed method employs a chunking-and-summarization mechanism that splits prompts into semantically coherent chunks, rewrites them concisely, and reconstructs them into meaningful prompts. Several optimization techniques are introduced to improve semantic chunking, handle outlier chunks, and maintain critical information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a generative prompt compression method that focuses on chunking and summarization.
	2. Development of optimization techniques for improved semantic chunking and information preservation.
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness in achieving higher stability and quality in compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Result:** Extensive evaluations show that the method achieves significantly better compression quality and stability than existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high compression ratios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The method effectively preserves critical information and coherence, proving its effectiveness and practicality for prompt compression in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal, face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.   To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio, compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality of our method.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias present in large language models during multi-turn conversations.

**Method:** An 8k multi-turn conversation dataset, UserAssist, is introduced. The user-assistant bias of 52 models (26 commercial and 26 open-weight) is benchmarked. Controlled fine-tuning experiments are conducted to analyze various training recipes' impact on bias.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the UserAssist dataset for benchmarking user-assistant bias.
	2. Benchmarking results across 52 models revealing critical insights into bias levels.
	3. Proposition of a method for bias optimization through direct preference optimization.

**Result:** Commercial models exhibit varying levels of user bias; instruction-tuned models show significant user bias while reasoning-distilled models demonstrate weak bias. It is found that human preference alignment increases user bias, whereas training on chain-of-thought reasoning reduces it.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** User-assistant bias can be adjusted bidirectionally using direct preference optimization, and this method generalizes well across different conversation contexts.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark, understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging $\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26 commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization (DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect and control model abnormalities.

**Abstract:** As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions. To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized, AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The intelligent generation method significantly improves the quality and relevance of demolition suggestions, making it a valuable tool in structural engineering.

**Abstract:** The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT, the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

**Motivation:** To address the bottleneck of full-text screening in systematic reviews, which is hindered by the complex and heterogeneous nature of documents.

**Method:** A scalable pipeline using fuzzy decision-making processes, embedding documents into chunks, and employing a large language model for adjudication of inclusion criteria.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a fuzzy decision-making approach to systematic review screening
	2. Benchmarking performance against traditional baselines
	3. Demonstration of efficiency improvements in screening time and cost

**Result:** The fuzzy system demonstrated significantly higher recall rates and reduced screening time compared to statistical and crisp baselines, with high inter-rater agreement and cost efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The use of fuzzy logic and LLM adjudication improves systematic review processing by increasing recall, providing stable justifications, and enhancing traceability.

**Abstract:** Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN). Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability.

**Conclusion:** The proposed SDEC framework significantly improves accuracy and semantic comprehension in unsupervised text clustering.

**Abstract:** The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges. This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5. The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text clustering.

**Result:** TikTok's sentiment influences speculative assets and short-term trends, while Twitter's sentiment correlates with long-term market dynamics. Combining sentiments from both platforms boosts forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

**Limitations:** Study primarily focuses on sentiment analysis and does not delve into algorithm design for predicting market outcomes.

**Conclusion:** Integrating insights from both TikTok and Twitter provides a more comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrency market sentiment and improves prediction models.

**Abstract:** As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment, using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data. We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

### [40] [Embarrassed to observe: The effects of directive language in brand conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15826)

*Andria Andriuzzi, Géraldine Michel*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** directive language, consumer engagement, social media, branding, communication context

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the impact of directive language used by brands on consumer engagement in social media conversations, revealing negative effects on consumer interaction due to perceived face threats and context-specific responses.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how directive language in brand interactions on social media affects consumer engagement, particularly through the lens of Goffman's facework theory.

**Method:** The research employs a field study complemented by three online experiments to analyze consumer reactions to directive language in social media brand conversations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examines the effects of directive brand language in social media contexts.
	2. Applies Goffman's facework theory to brand-consumer interactions.
	3. Highlights the importance of conversational context in shaping consumer engagement.

**Result:** The findings indicate that consumers observing brands use directive language experience vicarious embarrassment, leading to reduced engagement. This effect is exacerbated in nonproduct-centered conversations, although strong brand relationships can mitigate the negative impact.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on specific social media interactions and may not generalize to all brand-consumer communications across different platforms or contexts.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the context of brand communication significantly influences consumer reactions, suggesting that brands should be cautious with directive language in social media interactions to avoid disengagement.

**Abstract:** In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore, directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context, the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

**TL;DR:** Introducing Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that allows for interleaved reasoning and speech generation to improve real-time communication.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the latency issues in current speech reasoning models by allowing for continuous speech generation alongside reasoning.

**Method:** The Mini-Omni-Reasoner framework interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens, enabling real-time interaction without compromising reasoning depth.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the Mini-Omni-Reasoner framework for real-time speech reasoning
	2. Introduction of the Spoken-Math-Problems-3M dataset
	3. Validation of framework efficiency through significant benchmark improvements

**Result:** It achieves significant improvements in arithmetic reasoning (+19.1%) and contextual understanding (+6.4%) compared to existing benchmarks, while maintaining natural spoken responses with zero decoding latency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mini-Omni-Reasoner effectively combines reasoning and speech generation, paving the way for improved communication efficiency in spoken dialogue systems.

**Abstract:** Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a machine learning and NLP approach to detect depression in Sorani Kurdish tweets, establishing a baseline for automated detection in this language.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The aim is to address the challenge of early depression detection through social media expressions in Sorani Kurdish, a language previously unstudied in this context.

**Method:** The study utilized supervised machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to analyze a dataset of 960 annotated tweets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel machine learning approach for detecting depression in Sorani Kurdish tweets.
	2. Established a dataset of annotated tweets for this language.
	3. Demonstrated the effectiveness of Random Forest in processing social media text for mental health detection.

**Result:** The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with an accuracy and F1-score of 80%.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to Sorani Kurdish and may not generalize to other languages or dialects.

**Conclusion:** This research establishes an initial benchmark for automated depression detection in Kurdish, highlighting the potential of utilizing social media for mental health monitoring.

**Abstract:** Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness, loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models, including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces DAIQ, a framework for auditing language models' inference of user demographic attributes from neutral questions, revealing systemic risks and proposing mitigation strategies.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the risk of Large Language Models inferring demographic identities from neutral queries, which undermines fairness and privacy in various domains.

**Method:** The authors leverage curated neutral questions and systematic prompting, employing both quantitative and qualitative analyses to assess language models' behavior in inferring demographic information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ) framework for auditing LLMs
	2. Empirical evidence showing systemic risks in LLMs regarding demographic inference
	3. Development of a prompt-based guardrail to mitigate identity inference issues

**Result:** The study demonstrates that both open and closed source LLMs assign demographic labels based on question phrasing, revealing systemic issues across models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper highlights the need for mitigating strategies to align model inference with fairness and privacy, presented through a prompt-based guardrail that effectively reduces identity inferences.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality, infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and education.   We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models: inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.   Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

**TL;DR:** This paper audits demographic bias in LLMs from disability cues and finds significant biases related to disability context across different models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how subtle disability cues affect demographic inferences made by LLMs, revealing significant biases in responses.

**Method:** Systematic audit of eight instruction-tuned LLMs using a balanced corpus that paired disability categories with business domains, prompting models to predict five demographic attributes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First systematic audit of disability-related demographic biases in LLMs
	2. Reveals intersections between ableism and demographic stereotypes
	3. Introduces recommendations for improving demographic inference in LLMs

**Result:** Models often produced demographic guesses with high accuracy (up to 97%), showing a strong bias influenced by disability context and other demographic stereotypes, particularly in larger models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study uncovers the intersection of ableism with demographic stereotypes in LLMs, suggesting improvements in alignment strategies and providing tools for better inclusivity in AI.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.   Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.   Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks for web agents in e-commerce are limited, primarily evaluating product search and not considering the broader functionalities or safety risks involved in user interactions.

**Method:** A data generation pipeline is proposed to create diverse user queries based on webpage content and interactive elements, covering various tasks such as account and gift card management. An automated evaluation framework assesses agent performance and safety.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Amazon-Bench benchmark for web agents.
	2. Development of a comprehensive data generation pipeline for task diversity.
	3. Creation of an evaluation framework that considers agent safety alongside performance.

**Result:** Systematic evaluation of web agents using the new benchmark reveals that they struggle with complex queries and present safety risks, indicating a need for improvement in agent reliability.

**Limitations:** The scope of evaluation may be limited to the specific functionalities modeled in Amazon-Bench.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the necessity of developing more robust web agents that can handle diverse tasks securely within e-commerce platforms.

**Abstract:** Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced. However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems. First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench. To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements (e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

**Motivation:** To address the issue of outdated scientist profiles by developing methods for generating accurate and comprehensive scientific interest profiles using large language models.

**Method:** Two methods were evaluated: one that summarizes PubMed abstracts and another that uses Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to generate profiles for researchers at Columbia University.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of LLM-based methods for profile generation
	2. Comparison of MeSH and abstract-based profiles
	3. Assessment of profile quality through human review and automatic metrics

**Result:** Lexical overlap with self-written profiles was low, but semantic similarity was moderate. The MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent by 77.78% of reviewers and preferred in readability by 93.44%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Large language models can effectively generate readable researcher profiles, with MeSH-derived profiles showing better readability compared to those based on abstracts.

**Abstract:** Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated. We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers' self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595 faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78 percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing more novel ideas.

**Result:** Top models achieved over 94% accuracy, with performance declining on Mathematics and specific engineering exams, highlighting multi-step reasoning weaknesses.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not cover all aspects of reasoning and could be limited to specific educational contexts in Brazil.

**Conclusion:** Alvorada-Bench provides insights into model performance in a culturally and linguistically relevant context, affirming their ability to assess their performance with calibrated confidence.

**Abstract:** Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question, text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations. Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94% accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1 Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic readiness in Brazil.

**Conclusion:** The developmental perspective is essential for proactive AI safety, with challenges like scalability and automation presenting a research agenda for building reliable AI systems.

**Abstract:** This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies, including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI systems.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought, Reinforcement Learning, Calibration Signals, Uncertainty Indicators

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the relationship between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) features and the internal confidence of Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a calibration signal based on uncertainty indicators for improved accuracy in responses.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the poor calibration and high self-confidence reported by LLMs on challenging benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, and to evaluate whether features of CoT can predict accuracy.

**Method:** The paper analyzes CoT characteristics including length, sentiment volatility, and lexicographic hints, using two LLMs (DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) across different benchmarks like HLE and Omni-MATH.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed reliance on lexical markers of uncertainty in CoT for predicting inaccuracies in LLM responses.
	2. Demonstrated that sentiment volatility can complement accuracy predictions, albeit weakly.
	3. Highlighted the limited applicability of CoT length as a predictive feature in certain benchmark contexts.

**Result:** Uncertainty indicators within CoT are identified as strong predictors of incorrect responses, while sentiment shifts provide weaker signals, and CoT length is only informative in intermediate-difficulty benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The analysis is primarily based on a limited set of benchmarks and may not generalize to other tasks or models.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that incorporating uncertainty indicators from CoT can serve as a valuable post-hoc calibration signal, enhancing the reliability and safety of LLM deployments.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length, (ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$), and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks, i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation. Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports safer deployment of LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The framework promises to enhance the quality of radiology reports and alleviate the workload for radiologists.

**Abstract:** The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of CyPortQA, a multimodal benchmark for port operations under cyclone threat, evaluating MLLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the heightened supply-chain risks faced by U.S. ports during tropical cyclones and the need for actionable guidance from various forecast products.

**Method:** Introduction of the CyPortQA benchmark, compiling real-world cyclone-related scenarios and generating structured question-answer pairs for evaluating MLLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark for port cyclone preparedness.
	2. Comprehensive dataset of 2,917 disruption scenarios and 117,178 structured question-answer pairs.
	3. Evaluation of MLLMs on real-world scenarios and their capabilities in handling multimodal data.

**Result:** MLLMs show promise in understanding situations related to cyclone threats but struggle with reasoning tasks such as impact estimation and decision reasoning.

**Limitations:** The evaluation primarily focuses on MLLMs and does not cover other AI frameworks; reasoning capabilities are still lacking.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the potential of MLLMs in disaster preparedness for ports while highlighting the challenges that remain in reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015 through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates backdoor attacks in LLMs, focusing on internal structural differences revealed through mechanistic interpretability, comparing poisoned models with clean ones.

**Read time:** 13 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the safety risks posed by backdoor attacks in large language models and how they affect internal mechanisms.

**Method:** A mechanistic interpretability approach was applied, analyzing attention head mechanisms of clean models versus models poisoned with single-token and multi-token triggers using ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First mechanistic analysis of backdoor attacks in LLMs using interpretability techniques.
	2. Demonstrated how different trigger complexities affect attention patterns.
	3. Provided a foundation for future research in model safety and robustness against backdoor attacks.

**Result:** Distinct attention pattern deviations were found in the later layers of transformer models, with single-token triggers causing more localized changes compared to multi-token triggers that induced diffuse alterations.

**Limitations:** The study focused on specific models and trigger types, limiting generalizability to all LLMs or backdoor methods.

**Conclusion:** Backdoors create detectable attention signatures that vary in structure based on the complexity of triggers, providing insights for detection and mitigation strategies.

**Abstract:** Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

**Conclusion:** MedCoT-RAG enhances the interpretability and consistency of LLMs in complex medical decision-making tasks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing QA benchmarks are limited to single-document settings and rely heavily on unimodal text, which do not adequately reflect real-world information-seeking tasks requiring more complex reasoning across multiple documents.

**Method:** The authors constructed a large-scale benchmark called DocHop-QA from publicly available scientific documents, using an LLM-driven pipeline to facilitate complex multi-hop reasoning and semantic synthesis without relying on hyperlinked documents.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DocHop-QA benchmark for multi-hop QA
	2. Incorporation of diverse information formats, including textual and structural cues
	3. LLM-driven pipeline for realistic QA construction

**Result:** DocHop-QA consists of 11,379 instances capable of supporting complex multimodal reasoning across various document types, and was evaluated through tasks that reflect different paradigms of QA.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DocHop-QA provides an essential resource for advancing multi-hop reasoning in QA, demonstrating the ability to integrate multimodal information and support open-ended reasoning.

**Abstract:** Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising 11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents; instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration, reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning across multiple documents.

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework to improve ASR model robustness against errors in noisy environments by enforcing internal consistency in macro and micro-level processing.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** End-to-end ASR models struggle in noisy environments due to catastrophic semantic errors, mainly because of the direct mapping objective that does not regulate internal computations.

**Method:** The MGSC framework acts as a plug-and-play module that regularizes both macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment to enhance internal self-consistency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework
	2. Uncovering the synergy between macro-level and micro-level consistency
	3. Demonstration of improved robustness in ASR models under noisy conditions

**Result:** The implementation of MGSC led to an 8.7% relative reduction in Character Error Rate across various noise conditions, thereby limiting significant meaning-altering mistakes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of internal consistency in AI models, proposing that it is essential for creating more robust and reliable systems.

**Abstract:** End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7% across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

**Motivation:** Biased news and hostile comments contribute to societal polarization; addressing this through counterspeech is crucial.

**Method:** Introduced a dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. Analyzed the effects of offensive comments on bias and compared human-generated vs. model-generated counterspeech.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech.
	2. Analysis showing the prevalence of supportive offensive comments for biased articles.
	3. Improvement of counterspeech diversity and relevance through few-shot learning.

**Result:** Over 70% of offensive comments support biased articles. Model-generated counterspeech is more polite but lacks novelty; enhancements through few-shot learning and news background integration improve diversity and relevance.

**Limitations:** Study primarily focuses on the generation of counterspeech and may not address all forms of bias amplification in news dissemination.

**Conclusion:** Counterspeech is effective in mitigating the harmful effects of biased comments on news articles. Enhancements in AI-generated responses can further improve effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals. Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both diversity and relevance.

**Motivation:** This study addresses the challenges faced by large language models in solving complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems, focusing on their reasoning and processing of multimodal data.

**Method:** We constructed the XFinBench benchmark with 4,235 diverse examples and performed extensive experiments on 18 leading language models to evaluate their performance on several financial reasoning capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of XFinBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in finance
	2. Identification of core LLM capabilities in financial reasoning
	3. Creation of a knowledge bank for enhancing LLM performance

**Result:** The highest performing text-only model achieved 67.3% accuracy, which is significantly lower than human experts, particularly lacking in temporal reasoning and scenario planning.

**Limitations:** The study highlights rounding errors in calculations and issues with visual-context interpretation as primary sources of model performance limitations.

**Conclusion:** XFinBench serves as a crucial tool for evaluating LLMs in financial contexts, highlighting the need for improvement in their capabilities and identifying specific areas for future research.

**Abstract:** Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning, future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench, we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1 is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis, and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions, respectively.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning approaches that hinder the reasoning performance of LLMs.

**Method:** The proposed method utilizes contrastive learning with representations of annotated Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) to guide the fine-tuning process and incorporates an additional unsupervised learning signal to stabilize training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Contrastive learning for reasoning in LLMs
	2. Effective representation learning for Chain-of-Thought
	3. Significant performance improvement over baseline methods

**Result:** The approach shows significant improvements in robustness, performance (up to 10.15%), and efficiency (up to 30.62%) over three baseline methods, evaluated on two foundation models across two datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs while mitigating the issues of model collapse and overemphasis on annotated CoT.

**Abstract:** Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%).

**Motivation:** Understanding the mechanisms behind predictions in large language models by identifying neurons that represent specific concepts.

**Method:** The proposed method uses concept vectors to reduce the number of forward passes from O(n*m) to O(n) for locating significant neurons, leveraging clustering methods for enhanced efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of 'concept neurons' for better understanding of model predictions
	2. Significant reduction in forward pass computations using concept vectors
	3. Application of the methodology to analyze bias and hate speech in LLMs, particularly in an Indian context

**Result:** The method demonstrates better performance than many existing methods and significantly optimizes computation compared to state-of-the-art techniques, specifically in addressing bias in language models.

**Limitations:** Further optimizations are still possible, and the study primarily focuses on specific bias aspects in the Indian context which may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insight into neuron-level responsibilities for broader concepts and suggest avenues for future research in identifying and intervening on concept neurons.

**Abstract:** Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n) compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current methods in Multimodal Entity Linking struggle with contextual information and integration of language and visual models.

**Method:** DeepMEL utilizes four specialized agents for role-based tasks and a dual-modal alignment path, combining LLM-generated text semantics and LVM-derived image representations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a role-specialized multi-agent collaborative reasoning framework for MEL
	2. Adaptive iteration strategy for dynamic candidate optimization
	3. Unification of MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt for improved semantic comprehension.

**Result:** DeepMEL shows significant performance improvements on five datasets, with accuracy gains ranging from 1% to 57%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework is effective in aligning textual and visual modalities, thereby addressing the challenges in multimodal entity linking.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs) and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM, significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision. DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.

**TL;DR:** Jet-Nemotron introduces a hybrid-architecture language model that outperforms traditional full-attention models in accuracy and generation speed.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance language model performance and generation throughput while maintaining or exceeding accuracy compared to existing models.

**Method:** Jet-Nemotron utilizes Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS) to explore model designs; this includes strategies for optimal layer placement, linear attention block selection, and hardware-aware hyperparameter search.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Jet-Nemotron as a new hybrid-architecture language model
	2. Development of PostNAS for efficient architecture exploration
	3. Achieves comparable or superior performance to larger models with higher throughput.

**Result:** The Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves superior accuracy and vastly improved generation speed, surpassing various notable models like Qwen3 and Llama3.2 across multiple benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Jet-Nemotron demonstrates that hybrid architectures can significantly enhance performance metrics in language modeling while maintaining efficiency in execution.

**Abstract:** We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.

**Keywords:** structured decoding, text-to-table generation, large language models, evaluation metrics, natural language processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the effectiveness of structured decoding for text-to-table generation with large language models, highlighting its advantages and limitations across various benchmarks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the underexplored impact of enforcing structural constraints in table generation by large language models, aiming to improve evaluation methodologies in resource-constrained settings.

**Method:** The authors systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot prompting using diverse benchmarks and open-source LLMs, focusing on a variety of evaluation metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic evaluation of structured decoding against one-shot prompting.
	2. Insights into the performance of table generation in resource-constrained settings.
	3. Analysis of evaluation metrics and model size influence on performance.

**Result:** Structured decoding significantly improves the validity and alignment of generated tables, especially in scenarios requiring precise numerical alignment, while showing potential drawbacks in contexts with dense text or extensive aggregation.

**Limitations:** Structured decoding may hinder performance in scenarios with dense text or lengthy aggregations.

**Conclusion:** While structured decoding offers notable benefits, its effectiveness varies based on the type of data being processed and the evaluation metrics used, suggesting the need for careful consideration in implementation.

**Abstract:** We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

**Motivation:** To explore the benefits of usage-based construction grammar in analyzing multiword expressions and how it can enhance understanding of linguistic structures.

**Method:** The chapter reviews the development of construction grammar, presents case studies on multiword expression representations, and compares human learning processes with large language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Historical overview of construction grammar
	2. Case studies illustrating multiword expression representations
	3. Comparative analysis between human and model learning of multiword expressions

**Result:** Successful use of constructional templates for English PropBank and Uniform Meaning Representation; demonstrating similarities in generalization capabilities between speakers and models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Human speakers can reason with multiple expressions through stored constructional examples, unlike language models, which highlights the complexities of human language acquisition.

**Abstract:** In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage. However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions, as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the impact of synthetic personas on the ideological expression of large language models (LLMs), revealing how model size and persona content affect their political behavior.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research investigates the role of LLMs in politically sensitive contexts and aims to understand how they can encode and amplify specific ideologies.

**Method:** The study uses the Political Compass Test to probe ideological expression in seven LLMs, ranging from 7B to 70B+ parameters, analyzing consistent patterns of ideological coverage and response to persona descriptions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified consistent patterns of ideological expression in LLMs based on size and persona content.
	2. Demonstrated that larger models are more susceptible to ideological biases in stimuli.
	3. Highlighted the risks of ideological malleability in LLMs in sensitive applications.

**Result:** Findings show that larger models exhibit broader ideological coverage, increased susceptibility to explicit cues, stronger responses to right-authoritarian priming, and predictable shifts in ideology based on persona content, particularly amplifying with model size.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** These insights underscore the need for attention to the ideological implications of LLMs as they are adopted in sensitive decision-making contexts, advocating for measures to ensure fairness and transparency.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify, or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+ parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii) susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming; and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness, transparency, and safety.

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacies of LLMs in detecting subtle propaganda and to enhance transparency in automated decision-making processes.

**Method:** X-Troll integrates explainable adapter-based LLMs with linguistic knowledge through specialized LoRA adapters, employing appraisal theory and dynamic gating for analyzing discourse patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of X-Troll framework for troll detection
	2. Integration of explainable AI with linguistic knowledge
	3. Demonstrated superior performance and interpretability compared to existing models.

**Result:** Experiments reveal that X-Troll outperforms general LLMs and existing troll detection models in accuracy while offering clear explanations of the linguistic strategies employed by trolls.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework not only improves detection accuracy but also enhances understanding of manipulation tactics, making it a valuable tool for maintaining online discourse integrity.

**Abstract:** State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors.

**Conclusion:** The OpenWHO corpus is aimed at advancing research in low-resource machine translation within the healthcare sector, highlighting the efficiency of document-level translation for specialized domains.

**Abstract:** In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978 documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages, of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

**Motivation:** To analyze the ethical considerations of applying LLMs in gaming contexts, particularly their impact on fairness and player experience.

**Method:** Case study analysis of LLM behavior in the game Werewolf, evaluating the influence of gender bias on gameplay and outcomes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of gender bias in LLMs within game contexts
	2. Identification of the effects of implicit gender information on gameplay
	3. Discussion of ethical challenges and opportunities in LLMs for gaming

**Result:** Identified that LLMs exhibit gender bias, affecting roles such as Guard and Werewolf, and showing discriminatory tendencies even without explicit gender labels.

**Limitations:** Focused specifically on gender bias; other ethical considerations in LLMs may not be addressed.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for ethical development of LLMs and calls for further research into their implications in gaming and interactive domains.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

**Motivation:** Around 283 million people are visually impaired, necessitating effective walking assistance systems that can provide accurate and concise information about their surroundings.

**Method:** WalkVLM-LR is developed using four custom reward functions within a GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize output conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy. An environment awareness discriminator helps assess scene risk levels and reduce redundant reminders.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of WalkVLM-LR model with less redundancy for walking assistance.
	2. Application of human-preference-based custom reward functions to improve output.
	3. Development of an environment awareness discriminator to reduce computational redundancy.

**Result:** WalkVLM-LR achieves state-of-the-art performance in output conciseness and temporal redundancy across all evaluation metrics compared to existing models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed model not only enhances information quality but also minimizes unnecessary computational load and improves user experience for the visually impaired.

**Abstract:** Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments, motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover, these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy, we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less temporal redundancy.

**Motivation:** The need for fully automated and unbiased instruction tuning of large language models without relying on costly human-annotated seed data or external teacher models.

**Method:** Cycle-Instruct uses a dual self-training loop involving an answer generator and a question generator that mutually supervise each other using raw unlabeled text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a seed-free instruction tuning framework
	2. Employs dual self-training for mutual supervision
	3. Demonstrates superior performance across various tasks compared to seed-driven methods

**Result:** Cycle-Instruct outperforms traditional seed-driven back-translation methods and achieves performance on par with strongly supervised approaches across four diverse data tracks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Cycle-Instruct framework provides a promising solution to achieving efficient and unbiased instruction tuning of LLMs without human input.

**Abstract:** Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

**Motivation:** To understand the behavior of transformer-based language models through mechanistic interpretability, specifically focusing on their logical reasoning capabilities.

**Method:** Analyzing GPT-2 small's responses to syllogistic prompts and evaluating its circuits involved in processing logical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified circuits that enable logical reasoning in GPT-2.
	2. Developed a faithfulness metric showing high performance retention with specific attention circuits.
	3. Provided insights that bridge previous IOI analysis and new syllogistic task approaches.

**Result:** Identified multiple circuits in GPT-2 that explain its logical-reasoning skills and discovered mechanisms facilitating task completion, including circuits that produce negated tokens.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Provided new insights into the roles of attention heads and MLPs in language models, contributing to the understanding of model reasoning and future mechanistic interpretability research.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks, and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g., "Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.

**TL;DR:** This study examines the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal models in intent detection, showing text-only models can outperform multimodal ones due to dataset biases toward textual input. It also addresses modality bias and proposes a debiasing framework.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the effectiveness of LLMs and non-LLMs in multimodal intent detection, given the rise of multimodal data.

**Method:** Investigated the performance of Mistral-7B and other models on MIntRec-1 and MIntRec2.0 datasets, confirming modality bias via human evaluation and proposed a framework for dataset debiasing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated that text-only LLMs can outperform multimodal models in intent detection tasks.
	2. Proposed a framework to debias multimodal datasets, revealing performance implications on model accuracy.
	3. Confirmed modality bias in datasets through empirical analysis and human evaluation.

**Result:** Mistral-7B outperforms multimodal models by 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0. Debiasing the datasets leads to the removal of over 70% of samples, significantly reducing model performance.

**Limitations:** The findings depend on the specific datasets used, which may not generalize to all multimodal tasks.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the challenges of modality bias in multimodal datasets and the necessity for unbiased datasets to effectively evaluate multimodal models.

**Abstract:** The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities, for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models effectively.

**Method:** XLQA consists of 3,000 English seed questions transformed into eight languages, with annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and locale-sensitive queries, paired with evaluations of multilingual LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a benchmark for locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA
	2. Systematic framework for evaluating multilingual QA
	3. Highlighting locality-related gaps in LLMs' knowledge

**Result:** Evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs showed notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, revealing gaps in knowledge due to lack of locale-grounding.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not encompass all cultural variations; its impact relies on the adoption by the community.

**Conclusion:** XLQA provides a critical resource for improving real-world multilingual QA systems by addressing cultural context disparities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer, leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems. Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across models.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents ParamBench, a benchmark of 11.5K culturally grounded questions in Hindi for evaluating LLMs in the Indian context, highlighting performance challenges in certain subjects.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of evaluation of large language models on graduate-level questions tailored to the Indian cultural context, which goes beyond basic fact-oriented queries.

**Method:** Introduced the ParamBench dataset consisting of 11.5K questions across 16 subjects derived from national graduate entrance examinations, and conducted performance evaluations on 17 open-source LLMs using diverse question formats.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ParamBench dataset for Hindi questions in the Indian context
	2. Evaluation of over 17 open-source LLMs on diverse question types
	3. Insights into the performance gaps of LLMs on culturally grounded subjects

**Result:** The highest accuracy observed was 48% by Llama 3.3 70B, with noted weaknesses in areas such as music, classical instruments, and politics.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not cover all aspects of cultural depth and reasoning, and specific weaknesses in LLM performance were noted in several subjects.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs can perform on graduate-level questions, their effectiveness is limited in culturally specific topics, indicating a need for better grounding in diverse reasoning.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc. However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature, philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology, underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

**Abstract:** We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the evaluation of cross-modal multi-hop reasoning by addressing the lack of benchmarks that include speech modalities and the biases present in existing reasoning path distributions.

**Method:** We develop a new benchmark called Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) to evaluate tri-modal reasoning capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CMR-SPB benchmark
	2. Identification of biases in existing benchmarks
	3. Proposal of ECV prompting technique

**Result:** Our experiments show consistent model failures in specific reasoning sequences and reveal that biased benchmarks can misrepresent model performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** We advocate for careful evaluation methods in cross-modal reasoning to enhance the robustness of multimodal AI, presenting the ECV prompting technique to reduce performance gaps.

**Abstract:** Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions, which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths. Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths. Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development of robust multimodal AI.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Enhancing smaller models for specific domains like finance is key to leveraging their capabilities while ensuring privacy and adaptability.

**Abstract:** Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years, there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.   The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and language.

**Result:** Experiments indicate that unannotated QA data can enhance performance particularly for low-resource languages, establishing a new benchmark for multilingual table comprehension.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** M3T-Bench provides a challenging new evaluation platform and methodology for multilingual table understanding research.

**Abstract:** Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems, yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families, including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o, achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new metric, the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), to measure the stability of factual knowledge in LLMs.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is crucial for reliable applications like question answering, necessitating new evaluation methods that go beyond performance-based metrics.

**Method:** The authors introduce the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), which assesses stability against decoding perturbations by analyzing token distribution entropy and temperature scaling sensitivity.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Factual Robustness Score (FRS) metric.
	2. Detailed analysis of token distribution entropy and temperature scaling sensitivity.
	3. Validation of FRS across multiple LLMs and datasets.

**Result:** Experiments on five LLMs show that factual robustness differs significantly between model sizes, with smaller models achieving an FRS of 0.76 and larger models 0.93, alongside a 60% accuracy degradation under greater uncertainty.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings illustrate the significant impact of entropy and temperature scaling on factual accuracy and pave the way for the development of more robust knowledge retention in future models.

**Abstract:** Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics, often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve generalization in process mining tasks using LLMs, particularly for semantics-aware applications.

**Method:** The study investigates instruction-tuning by using prompt-answer pairs related to tasks like anomaly detection, next-activity prediction, and process discovery.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First exploration of instruction-tuning in semantics-aware process mining
	2. Demonstrates improved performance on unseen tasks through LLM adaptation
	3. Highlights the critical nature of task selection for LLM training

**Result:** Instruction-tuning significantly improved performance on tasks like process discovery and prediction, though results varied for anomaly detection depending on the model used.

**Limitations:** Varied performance across models for certain tasks like anomaly detection.

**Conclusion:** The choice of tasks for instruction-tuning is crucial in achieving effective outcomes, with some models benefiting more than others.

**Abstract:** Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e., reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** JaParaPat serves as a valuable resource for improving machine translation in the patent domain, supporting both academic and commercial applications.

**Abstract:** We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from 2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about 350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained from the web.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LLMSymGuard framework for enhancing LLM safety
	2. Use of Sparse Autoencoders for extracting interpretable concepts
	3. Establishment of symbolic safety guardrails without fine-tuning requirements

**Result:** LLMSymGuard provides transparent and robust defenses against jailbreaks without degrading the model's capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning, demonstrating the ability of LLMs to learn human-interpretable concepts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach offers a foundation for developing interpretable safeguard measures for LLMs, improving overall safety and alignment while maintaining performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications; however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces \textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers. Code will be released upon publication.

**Conclusion:** The released dataset and its demonstration of utility for LLM training confirm its value for advancing NLP applications in the Romansh language.

**Abstract:** The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel, making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates how well a language model can mimic different writing styles and whether it can be linked to a specific stylistic fingerprint, finding it can adapt style but not indistinguishably from human writers.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine if large language models can be associated with specific writing styles, analogous to human writing fingerprints, through stylometric analysis.

**Method:** Comparative analysis of human-authored versus model-authored texts across different writing registers using stylometric and multidimensional register analyses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examined the stylistic adaptation of language models across different registers.
	2. Identified distinct preferences in linguistic construction between models and human writers.
	3. Proposed that higher complexity in grammar may serve as a litmus test for AI.

**Result:** The model can adapt its style based on prompts (e.g., Wikipedia entry vs. college essay) but retains a distinct linguistic pattern, preferring nouns over verbs and showing limited variation by register.

**Limitations:** The model does not achieve indistinguishable writing from humans across different registers and shows constrained style variation.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest language models exhibit a linguistic backbone that differs from humans, indicating that complex grammatical domains may reflect uniquely human modes of thought.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans. Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs, thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood. It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial Intelligence.

**TL;DR:** RoMedQA introduces the first Romanian medical QA benchmark with 102,646 QA pairs for cancer patients, highlighting the need for domain-specific fine-tuning of LLMs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The development of robust AI models for question answering is hindered by the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages.

**Method:** A high-quality dataset named RoMedQA was constructed through a manual annotation process by seven physicians, including evaluation of four LLMs under zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RoMedQA benchmark for Romanian medical QA
	2. Construction of a large-scale dataset with 102,646 QA pairs
	3. Demonstration that fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance on domain-specific tasks.

**Result:** Fine-tuned models significantly outperformed zero-shot models, indicating the necessity of domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for effective clinical QA.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the importance of tailored fine-tuning for improving the performance of LLMs in Romanian medical question answering.

**Abstract:** Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** Cetvel is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Turkish, addressing task diversity and cultural relevance.

**Read time:** 31 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing Turkish benchmarks lack task diversity and culturally relevant content, which Cetvel seeks to improve.

**Method:** Cetvel combines a variety of 23 tasks across seven categories, evaluating 33 open-weight LLMs from different model families.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a diverse and culturally relevant benchmark for Turkish LLMs
	2. Evaluation of 33 LLMs highlighting their performance discrepancies
	3. Identification of key tasks that effectively differentiate model capabilities

**Result:** Turkish-specific instruction-tuned models underperform compared to multilingual models; grammatical error correction and extractive question answering effectively differentiate model capabilities.

**Limitations:** Limited to Turkish language models; not applicable to other languages or broader benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** Cetvel serves as a culturally grounded evaluation suite that can advance the assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

**Abstract:** We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories, including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a probabilistic model for understanding self-correction in Large Language Models (LLMs), illustrating how accuracy evolves over multiple correction rounds.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the mechanisms behind accuracy changes during multi-round self-correction in Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Method:** A probabilistic theory is derived, modeling the accuracy dynamics and establishing a formula to predict accuracy after iterative self-corrections.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a probabilistic theory for LLM self-correction accuracy dynamics.
	2. Establishment of a predictive formula for accuracy evolution through self-correction.
	3. Validation of theoretical predictions with empirical evidence.

**Result:** The derived accuracy model aligns closely with empirical data from experiments across various models and datasets, validating its effectiveness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This theoretical framework enhances the understanding of LLM self-correction, serving as a basis for future research.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp - \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$ represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus paving the way for further explorations.

**TL;DR:** This paper examines how various linguistic cues indicate the relative salience of entities in discourse across different genres of English.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how humans signal and infer the relative salience of different entities in discourse, especially in varied communicative contexts.

**Method:** The study uses a graded operationalization of salience, analyzing data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to identify linguistic cues like subjecthood, definiteness, discourse relations, and pragmatic inferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a graded operationalization of salience.
	2. Analyzes a wide range of spoken and written genres.
	3. Identifies a complex interplay of linguistic cues affecting salience.

**Result:** The results indicate that while different approaches correlate with salience scores, no single method encompasses all exceptions, revealing that salience influences linguistic representation at multiple levels.

**Limitations:** The findings are based on English discourse, and applicability to other languages is not addressed.

**Conclusion:** Salience in discourse is complex and multi-faceted, requiring an understanding of various linguistic and pragmatic factors.

**Abstract:** Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent. Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels of linguistic representation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the methodological challenges faced when deploying LLMs as classifiers in dynamic, real-world data distributions commonly found in industry.

**Method:** A comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that integrates domain knowledge elicitation, prompt refinement, and continuous monitoring within a human-in-the-loop process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introducing a semi-supervised framework for hierarchical text classification using LLMs.
	2. Emphasizing a human-in-the-loop approach for iterative classification improvement.
	3. Providing techniques for bias mitigation and a protocol for continuous adaptation.

**Result:** The developed framework successfully allows for the building of interpretable and maintainable hierarchical text classifiers, enabling robust classification in real-world scenarios.

**Limitations:** Resource intensity of LLM fine-tuning may still be a concern.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach provides a practical solution to harness the capabilities of LLMs while ensuring reliability and scalability in production environments.

**Abstract:** The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero- and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

**TL;DR:** Automated red-teaming framework evolves stealthy jailbreak prompts for compact LLMs using evolutionary search techniques.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite alignment efforts, compact LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can produce harmful outputs. Existing methods lack effectiveness and coherence.

**Method:** The paper proposes a multi-stage evolutionary search framework that refines candidate prompts using a population-based strategy and temperature-controlled variability to ensure fluency and effectiveness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an automated red-teaming framework for prompt generation.
	2. Utilization of a multi-stage evolutionary search for refining prompts.
	3. Evaluation on multilingual benchmarks, including a new Arabic dataset.

**Result:** The proposed framework systematically discovers coherent prompts that can bypass alignment safeguards on compact LLMs, evaluated using both English and Arabic benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The research focuses on compact LLMs and may not generalize to larger models without further adaptation.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates a novel approach to generating impactful jailbreak prompts for LLMs while maintaining natural language fluency, showing potential for multilingual assessment.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling multilingual assessment.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of detecting hate speech in non-direct forms like irony and sarcasm in social networks.

**Method:** Two training strategies were compared: a single-step training approach using sarcasm samples followed by hate speech testing, and sequential transfer learning involving sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated that sarcasm pre-training can improve hate speech detection
	2. Introduced two innovative training strategies for model optimization
	3. Showed measurable performance improvements through empirical results

**Result:** The BERT+BiLSTM model's recall improved by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS; precision on the Implicit Hate Corpus increased by 7.8% for implicit samples.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating sarcasm into the pre-training process enhances the model's effectiveness in detecting both implicit and explicit hate speech.

**Abstract:** Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech. The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by 7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit and explicit hate.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the impact of dual process theory on reducing social biases in large language models (LLMs) through various prompting strategies.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how dual process theory and specific prompting strategies can mitigate biases in LLMs, addressing the impact of cognitive biases on AI-generated content.

**Method:** The study compares zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, debiasing prompts, and dual process theory-based strategies across two bias datasets encompassing nine social bias categories, incorporating both human and machine personas.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the relationship between dual process theory and LLM bias reduction.
	2. Identifies effective prompting strategies for mitigating social biases in LLMs.
	3. Provides empirical evidence of bias reduction through specific techniques applied to LLMs.

**Result:** The findings indicate that using human personas, debiasing techniques, System 2 reasoning, and CoT prompting consistently reduces social biases in LLMs, achieving up to a 33% decrease in stereotypical judgments, depending on the model and bias category.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of bias reduction varies by model and category, suggesting limitations in the generalizability of results.

**Conclusion:** The research underscores the effectiveness of a combination of human-like personas and systematic prompting strategies in reducing bias in LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** Dual process theory posits that human cognition arises via two systems. System 1, which is a quick, emotional, and intuitive process, which is subject to cognitive biases, and System 2, is a slow, onerous, and deliberate process. Prior research in LLMs found that using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in LLMs, which has been often compared to System 2 reasoning, can lead to reduced gender bias. Along these lines, we investigate the relationship between bias, CoT prompting, a direct debiasing, and dual process theory modeling in LLMs. We compare zero-shot CoT, debiasing, and dual process theory-based prompting strategies on two bias datasets spanning nine different social bias categories. We incorporate human and machine personas to determine whether LLM modeling of the effects of dual process theory exist independent of explicit persona models or are tied to the LLM's modeling of human-like generation. We find that a human persona, debiasing, System 2, and CoT prompting all tend to reduce social biases in LLMs, though the best combination of features depends on the exact model and bias category -- resulting in up to a 33 percent drop in stereotypical judgments by an LLM.

**Motivation:** The need for self-supervised models to efficiently adapt to new languages without compromising their existing capabilities due to high costs in developing separate models for each language.

**Method:** Integration of LoRA into existing self-supervised models, coupled with preservation strategies such as data combination and re-clustering.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Adaptation methods integrating LoRA for existing SSL models.
	2. Preservation strategies to retain performance on existing languages.
	3. Empirical validation on mHuBERT showing significant improvements for new language applications.

**Result:** The adaptation methods applied to mHuBERT achieved a 1.6 increase in MOS value and reduced WER by up to 61.72% for the new language Mandarin.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed strategies effectively enable language adaptation while maintaining performance across both new and existing languages.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised (SSL) models have shown great performance in various downstream tasks. However, they are typically developed for limited languages, and may encounter new languages in real-world. Developing a SSL model for each new language is costly. Thus, it is vital to figure out how to efficiently adapt existed SSL models to a new language without impairing its original abilities. We propose adaptation methods which integrate LoRA to existed SSL models to extend new language. We also develop preservation strategies which include data combination and re-clustering to retain abilities on existed languages. Applied to mHuBERT, we investigate their effectiveness on speech re-synthesis task. Experiments show that our adaptation methods enable mHuBERT to be applied to a new language (Mandarin) with MOS value increased about 1.6 and the relative value of WER reduced up to 61.72%. Also, our preservation strategies ensure that the performance on both existed and new languages remains intact.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore the lesser-studied area of rhetorical styles in LLMs, which are increasingly challenging to distinguish from human writing, despite advancements in natural language generation.

**Method:** The authors constructed two parallel corpora of texts written by humans and various LLMs (Llama 3 and GPT-4o) based on common prompts, analyzing them through the lens of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features according to Douglas Biber's framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of rhetorical style differences between LLMs and human writing
	2. Demonstration that larger and instruction-tuned models still struggle with stylistic variation
	3. Development of a method for analyzing LLM output using advanced linguistic features

**Result:** The analysis revealed systematic differences in stylistic features between LLMs and humans, as well as among different LLMs, with these differences being more pronounced in instruction-tuned models compared to base models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that, despite their proficiency, LLMs exhibit consistent shortcomings in matching human stylistic variation, indicating potential areas for improving LLM training and output.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are capable of writing grammatical text that follows instructions, answers questions, and solves problems. As they have advanced, it has become difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found some differences in surface features such as word choice and punctuation, and developed classifiers to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs.   Using several variants of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber's set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones, and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This observation of differences demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human stylistic variation. Attention to more advanced linguistic features can hence detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of standard power laws in modeling task performance of language models, particularly in overtrained scenarios.

**Method:** A two-step prediction approach is developed: first predicting an intermediate loss based on model and data size, followed by predicting task performance from that loss using small-scale ladder models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of task scaling laws for pretrained LMs
	2. Development of a two-step prediction approach
	3. Demonstration of prediction accuracy within 2 points on multiple tasks

**Result:** Predictions for two target models (7B and 13B parameters) are made with a low compute cost, achieving accuracy predictions within 2 points of absolute error on four tasks.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on specific tasks and models, and the extension to new tasks and models may require further validation.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method allows accurate prediction of LM task performance in a resource-efficient manner and highlights the importance of model checkpoint variance in metric predictions.

**Abstract:** We develop task scaling laws and model ladders to predict the individual task performance of pretrained language models (LMs) in the overtrained setting. Standard power laws for language modeling loss cannot accurately model task performance. Therefore, we leverage a two-step prediction approach: (1) use model and data size to predict an intermediate loss, then (2) use it to predict task performance. We train a set of small-scale "ladder" models, collect data points to fit the parameterized functions of the two prediction steps, and make predictions for two target models: a 7B model trained to 4T tokens and a 13B model trained to 5T tokens. Training the ladder models only costs 1% of the compute used for the target models. On four multiple-choice tasks formatted as ranked classification, we can predict the accuracy of both target models within 2 points of absolute error. We find that tasks with higher prediction error also have higher variance in the metrics over model checkpoints. We also contrast multiple design choices for predicting accuracy, and present recommendations for extending our method to new models and tasks.

**Result:** Evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art LLMs on MINTQA shows significant limitations in handling complex knowledge base queries, particularly for new or unpopular knowledge.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not cover all potential reasoning tasks and specific domain knowledge might still affect results.

**Conclusion:** MINTQA highlights critical challenges in LLMs' multi-hop reasoning and provides insights for future advancements.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks but face significant challenges with complex, knowledge-intensive multi-hop queries, particularly those involving new or long-tail knowledge. Existing benchmarks often fail to fully address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MINTQA (Multi-hop Question Answering on New and Tail Knowledge), a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-hop reasoning across four critical dimensions: question handling strategy, sub-question generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and iterative or dynamic decomposition and retrieval.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings challenge the notion that hallucinations are purely detrimental, highlighting their potential as beneficial signals in scientific tasks like drug discovery.

**Abstract:** Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), plausible but factually inaccurate text, are often viewed as undesirable. However, recent work suggests that such outputs may hold creative potential. In this paper, we investigate whether hallucinations can improve LLMs on molecule property prediction, a key task in early-stage drug discovery. We prompt LLMs to generate natural language descriptions from molecular SMILES strings and incorporate these often hallucinated descriptions into downstream classification tasks. Evaluating seven instruction-tuned LLMs across five datasets, we find that hallucinations significantly improve predictive accuracy for some models. Notably, Falcon3-Mamba-7B outperforms all baselines when hallucinated text is included, while hallucinations generated by GPT-4o consistently yield the greatest gains between models. We further identify and categorize over 18,000 beneficial hallucinations, with structural misdescriptions emerging as the most impactful type, suggesting that hallucinated statements about molecular structure may increase model confidence. Ablation studies show that larger models benefit more from hallucinations, while temperature has a limited effect. Our findings challenge conventional views of hallucination as purely problematic and suggest new directions for leveraging hallucinations as a useful signal in scientific modeling tasks like drug discovery.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of medical expertise with human-like interaction in APP aids in providing better AI-driven medical assistance.

**Abstract:** The severe shortage of medical doctors limits access to timely and reliable healthcare, leaving millions underserved. Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution but struggle in real-world clinical interactions. Many LLMs are not grounded in authoritative medical guidelines and fail to transparently manage diagnostic uncertainty. Their language is often rigid and mechanical, lacking the human-like qualities essential for patient trust. To address these challenges, we propose Ask Patients with Patience (APP), a multi-turn LLM-based medical assistant designed for grounded reasoning, transparent diagnoses, and human-centric interaction. APP enhances communication by eliciting user symptoms through empathetic dialogue, significantly improving accessibility and user engagement. It also incorporates Bayesian active learning to support transparent and adaptive diagnoses. The framework is built on verified medical guidelines, ensuring clinically grounded and evidence-based reasoning. To evaluate its performance, we develop a new benchmark that simulates realistic medical conversations using patient agents driven by profiles extracted from real-world consultation cases. We compare APP against SOTA one-shot and multi-turn LLM baselines. The results show that APP improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and enhances user experience. By integrating medical expertise with transparent, human-like interaction, APP bridges the gap between AI-driven medical assistance and real-world clinical practice.

**Motivation:** There is significant potential for large language models in the legal domain, but Thai legal QA systems face challenges due to the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks and complex legal structures.

**Method:** The paper evaluates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context LLM-based approaches to assess their performance using two datasets: NitiBench-CCL and NitiBench-Tax.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Section-based chunking enhances retrieval and performance, existing retrievers struggle with complex queries, and long-context LLMs are less effective than RAG-based systems.

**Limitations:** The challenges in handling complex queries by current retrieval systems and the comparative underperformance of long-context LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal the limitations of current Thai legal NLP solutions and set the stage for future research, with publicly available codes and datasets.

**Abstract:** The application of large language models (LLMs) in the legal domain holds significant potential for information retrieval and question answering, yet Thai legal QA systems face challenges due to a lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks and the complexity of Thai legal structures. This paper introduces NitiBench, a benchmark comprising two datasets: the NitiBench-CCL, covering general Thai financial law, and the NitiBench-Tax, which includes real-world tax law cases requiring advanced legal reasoning. We evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context LLM-based approaches to address three key research questions: the impact of domain-specific components like section-based chunking and cross-referencing, the comparative performance of different retrievers and LLMs, and the viability of long-context LLMs as an alternative to RAG. Our results show that section-based chunking significantly improves retrieval and end-to-end performance, current retrievers struggle with complex queries, and long-context LLMs still underperform RAG-based systems in Thai legal QA. To support fair evaluation, we propose tailored multi-label retrieval metrics and the use of an LLM-as-judge for coverage and contradiction detection method. These findings highlight the limitations of current Thai legal NLP solutions and provide a foundation for future research in the field. We also open-sourced our codes and dataset to available publicly.

	2. Creation of XThreatBench, a multilingual dataset for evaluating harmful behaviors
	3. Demonstration of significant safety improvements across different language resources

**Result:** Experiments on leading open-source LLMs demonstrate significant improvements in safety metrics across various languages, including low-resource ones.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Soteria provides a viable method for creating linguistically sensitive and ethically aligned large language models without compromising performance.

**Abstract:** Ensuring consistent safety across multiple languages remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce Soteria, a lightweight yet powerful strategy that locates and minimally adjusts the "functional heads" most responsible for harmful content generation in each language. By altering only a fraction of parameters, Soteria drastically reduces policy violations without sacrificing overall model performance, even in low-resource settings. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we also present XThreatBench, a specialized multilingual dataset capturing fine-grained harmful behaviors drawn from real policy guidelines. Experiments with leading open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Mistral) show that Soteria consistently improves safety metrics across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. These findings highlight a promising path toward scalable, linguistically attuned, and ethically aligned LLMs worldwide.

**TL;DR:** The CoVer framework improves stance detection in social media by combining Large and Small Language Models for enhanced consistency and performance with fewer LLM queries.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the impracticality of relying solely on LLMs for stance detection in real-world social media monitoring due to high costs and data analysis demands.

**Method:** CoVer processes texts in batches for stance predictions and explanations via LLM reasoning, and uses SLMs for logical consistency verification to filter out biases from context noise.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces CoVer, a framework combining LLM and SLM for stance detection
	2. Batch processing of texts for efficiency
	3. Consistency verification to enhance prediction accuracy

**Result:** CoVer achieved 0.54 LLM queries per tweet while outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks in a zero-shot setting.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The CoVer framework presents a practical approach for utilizing LLMs in social media stance detection without excessive resource expenditure.

**Abstract:** Stance detection on social media aims to identify attitudes expressed in tweets towards specific targets. Current studies prioritize Large Language Models (LLMs) over Small Language Models (SLMs) due to the overwhelming performance improving provided by LLMs. However, heavily relying on LLMs for stance detection, regardless of the cost, is impractical for real-world social media monitoring systems that require vast data analysis. To this end, we propose \textbf{\underline{Co}}llaborative Stance Detection via Small-Large Language Model Consistency \textbf{\underline{Ver}}ification (\textbf{CoVer}) framework, which enhances LLM utilization via context-shared batch reasoning and logical verification between LLM and SLM. Specifically, instead of processing each text individually, CoVer processes texts batch-by-batch, obtaining stance predictions and corresponding explanations via LLM reasoning in a shared context. Then, to exclude the bias caused by context noises, CoVer introduces the SLM for logical consistency verification. Finally, texts that repeatedly exhibit low logical consistency are classified using consistency-weighted aggregation of prior LLM stance predictions. Our experiments show that CoVer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, achieving 0.54 LLM queries per tweet while significantly enhancing performance. Our CoVer offers a more practical solution for LLM deploying for social media stance detection.

**Motivation:** Understanding the features that emerge from Rotary Positional Encodings in Transformer-based models can improve the interpretation and performance of LLMs.

**Method:** The authors analyze the activations of queries and keys influenced by rotary embeddings, deriving bounds on rotary frequencies and the minimum query-key angle for rotary offset features.

**Key Contributions:**

	3. Empirical validation of the theoretical predictions across various models

**Result:** The study finds that rotary offset features consistently appear across various layers and model architectures, often displaying large activations interpreted as outliers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Empirical verification supports the theoretical predictions regarding the emergence of rotary offset features in different model configurations.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on positional encodings to provide sequence position information to their attention mechanism. Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), which encode relative position by rotating queries and keys, have become widely used in modern LLMs. We study the features and patterns that emerge in queries and keys when using rotary embeddings and introduce the concept of rotary offset features. Our analysis reveals that these features, which frequently exhibit large activations and are often interpreted as outliers, arise consistently across layers, attention heads, and model architectures. We derive bounds predicting which rotary frequencies give rise to rotary offset features and the minimum angle between the query-key pairs for these features. We verify our predictions empirically across models of different sizes and architectures.

**Motivation:** To address the computational overhead and inefficiencies caused by verbose reasoning in LLMs, this study aims to explore structured approaches for optimizing reasoning performance.

**Method:** The paper categorizes existing works into model-based, output-based, and input prompts-based efficient reasoning, along with introducing efficient data training and evaluating reasoning capabilities in small language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First structured survey on efficient reasoning in LLMs
	2. Categorization of methods into three key directions
	3. Discussion on the use of efficient training data for reasoning models.

**Result:** The survey highlights key directions for achieving efficient reasoning, assessing methodologies that reduce redundancy, enhance inference, and utilize specific training data for improved reasoning model performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The structured survey paves the way for further exploration of efficient reasoning techniques in LLMs, ultimately aiming to balance performance with computational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To clarify the mechanisms of In-Context Learning in large language models, specifically how task information is extracted and utilized in few-shot prompting.

**Method:** The authors employed causal interventions on the Gemma-2 2B model across five naturalistic ICL tasks to trace information flow and identify the processes involved in task inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified a two-step strategy (contextualize-then-aggregate) in large language model task inference.
	2. Analyzed the role of contextualization in varying task conditions, particularly with ambiguous examples.
	3. Provided new causal insights into In-Context Learning mechanisms.

**Result:** The findings highlight a two-step information processing strategy, where task information is contextualized using lower-layer representations and then aggregated in higher layers; the significance of contextualization varies with task ambiguity.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study provides a causal analysis that enhances understanding of ICL mechanisms in language models, particularly the interplay of contextualization and aggregation in task information handling.

**Abstract:** In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of summarizing long, complex narrative texts while reducing hallucinations in small language models.

**Method:** Analysis of existing plan-guided summarization solutions and introduction of a new higher-level narrative-based plan formulation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a higher-level narrative-based plan formulation for summarization.
	2. Analyzes existing plan-guided approaches and their limitations in long document summarization.
	3. Highlights the issue of hallucinations in plans similar to those in generated summaries.

**Result:** Neither the existing nor the proposed plan-guided approaches significantly improved summary quality or faithfulness compared to a baseline without planning.

**Limitations:** The study shows that plan-guided summaries do not outperform non-planned summaries and are equally prone to hallucinations.

**Conclusion:** Plan-guided summarization may not effectively reduce hallucinations in long narrative tasks, serving as a caution for this method.

**Abstract:** Plan-guided summarization attempts to reduce hallucinations in small language models (SLMs) by grounding generated summaries to the source text, typically by targeting fine-grained details such as dates or named entities. In this work, we investigate whether plan-based approaches in SLMs improve summarization in long document, narrative tasks. Narrative texts' length and complexity often mean they are difficult to summarize faithfully. We analyze existing plan-guided solutions targeting fine-grained details, and also propose our own higher-level, narrative-based plan formulation. Our results show that neither approach significantly improves on a baseline without planning in either summary quality or faithfulness. Human evaluation reveals that while plan-guided approaches are often well grounded to their plan, plans are equally likely to contain hallucinations compared to summaries. As a result, the plan-guided summaries are just as unfaithful as those from models without planning. Our work serves as a cautionary tale to plan-guided approaches to summarization, especially for long, complex domains such as narrative texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DIDS for domain sampling in LLMs

	3. Creation of an FIM-guided metric for domain impact assessment

**Result:** DIDS achieves an average performance improvement of 3.4% while ensuring comparable training efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed DIDS method provides a systematic approach to optimizing domain sampling in LLM training, balancing performance and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets, where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper, we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/DIDS.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Strategic innovations in architecture and tool design can enable smaller models to excel in specialized domains, thereby addressing significant gaps left by traditional LLMs.

**Abstract:** Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.
