### [1] [Computational Cognitive Modeling to understand the effects of Racializing AI on Human-AI cooperation with PigChase Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04636)

*Swapnika Dulam, Christopher L Dancy*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** human-AI interaction, racialization, decision-making, cognitive modeling, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the impact of perceived racialization of AI on human-AI cooperation during a gaming task.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research addresses the understudied effects of racialization in human-AI interactions and its implications for decision-making.

**Method:** Participants played the Pig Chase game while interacting with AI agents whose racial identities were manipulated, followed by a survey on their strategies and perceptions of AI intelligence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of racialization's impact on human-AI interaction.
	2. Statistical evidence of demographic influence on decision-making.
	3. Development of a cognitive model for analyzing decision strategies.

**Result:** Statistical analysis showed that demographic characteristics and the perceived identity of AI agents significantly influenced participants' decision-making and strategies in the game.

**Limitations:** The study's scope is limited to a specific game and participant demographics, which may not generalize to all contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the important role of racialization in shaping perceptions of AI systems and call for deeper exploration of these dynamics in HCI.

**Abstract:** Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.

### [2] [Transforming Fashion with AI: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models in Apparel Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04705)

*Nusrat Jahan Lamia, Sadia Afrin Mim*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Fashion, AI in Textile Manufacturing, Large Language Models, Fabric Classification, Human Creativity

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the role of large language models (LLMs) in textile manufacturing, focusing on garment design replication and fabric classification, revealing strengths and limitations of the models used.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the role of AI and LLMs in the evolving fashion industry and improve efficiency in garment design and textile manufacturing.

**Method:** Three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) were examined through stages of textile manufacturing, assessing their performance in fabric image generation and classification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a custom dataset for fabric image generation and classification
	2. Analysis of multiple LLMs in textile manufacturing stages
	3. Evaluation of AI's impact on human creativity in fashion design

**Result:** OpenAI DALL-E integrated with ChatGPT outperformed others in fabric construction replication and classification with accuracy rates of 80% and 55% for different construction types, respectively.

**Limitations:** All models struggled with complex fabric construction and intricate designs; reliance on AI may hinder human creativity.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs showed effectiveness in providing recommendations, they struggled with complex fabric constructions, indicating a potential hindrance to human creativity.

**Abstract:** Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.

**Conclusion:** SePA offers valuable insights into the design of trustworthy personal health informatics systems, alongside a transparency framework for balancing response quality and speed.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces SePA (Search-enhanced Predictive AI Agent), a novel LLM health coaching system that integrates personalized machine learning and retrieval-augmented generation to deliver adaptive, evidence-based guidance. SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models, evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect (Cliff's $\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.

### [4] [Evaluating Idle Animation Believability: a User Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05023)

*Eneko Atxa Landa, Elena Lazkano, Igor Rodriguez, Itsaso Rodríguez-Moreno, Itziar Irigoien*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Idle animations, Avatar realism, Animation dataset

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper discusses the challenges of animating realistic avatars, focusing on idle animations and presents the ReActIdle dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.

**Read time:** 11 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Animating avatars requires high-quality idle animations for realism, yet existing methods are costly and inefficient due to a lack of datasets and complexities in recording genuine movements.

**Method:** The paper analyzes perceptions of idle animations and presents a new dataset, ReActIdle, that includes both acted and genuine idle animations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ReActIdle dataset
	2. Demonstration that acted animations are perceived similarly to genuine ones
	3. Insights into the perception differences between handmade and recorded idle animations

**Result:** Users cannot distinguish between acted and genuine idle animations, and they perceive handmade and recorded animations differently, suggesting simpler recording processes could be adopted.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Future efforts to create idle animation datasets could be streamlined based on findings that actors can be instructed to perform genuine movements.

**Abstract:** Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real, and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** extended reality, productivity tools, Apple Vision Pro, user experience, human-computer interaction

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper examines the long-term usage of the Apple Vision Pro as a productivity tool through interviews with users.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the real-world application and limitations of XR devices as productivity tools, contrasting marketing claims with actual user experiences.

**Method:** Interviews were conducted with ten Apple Vision Pro users to gather insights on their engagement with the device in everyday settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Insights into long-term user engagement with Apple Vision Pro
	2. Identification of key limitations faced by users in practical settings
	3. Assessment of XR's role in enhancing productivity versus marketing claims

**Result:** Users reported increased productivity over time but identified limitations such as a lack of native applications and integration challenges with existing workflows.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by a small sample size and may not represent all user experiences with XR devices.

**Conclusion:** While XR has potential as a productivity tool, significant limitations remain that could affect its broader adoption.

**Abstract:** Extended Reality (XR) is increasingly used as a productivity tool and recent commercial XR devices have even been specifically designed as productivity tools, or, at least, are heavily advertised for such purposes, such as the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), which has now been available for more than one year. In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the emergence of multistability in the GrooveTransformer rhythm generation system and its implications for Digital Musical Instrument design.

**Method:** The study utilizes the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE) to analyze the deployment of GrooveTransformer in three artistic contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of GrooveTransformer's multistability across artistic contexts
	2. Application of VCE as an analytical framework for DMI design
	3. Insights into the affordances and collaborative nature of system development

**Result:** The paper identifies three stabilities of GrooveTransformer: as an autonomous drum generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer, and a rhythm driver for harmonic accompaniment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** VCE is valuable for Digital Musical Instrument design, highlighting the interaction between technology, users, and contexts in shaping the system's applications.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The study explores spatio-temporal transitions in cross-country road traffic volumes, modeling behavioral transitions in car-based mobility during and before the COVID pandemic using open traffic data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To utilize real-time road traffic data for supporting foresight decision-making and understanding car-based human mobility behavior.

**Method:** Developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional traffic flow variables from a dataset of hourly traffic counts obtained from transport authorities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a reproducible workflow for traffic data analysis
	2. Insights into car-based mobility transitions due to COVID-19
	3. Recommendations for better data handling for environmental assessments

**Result:** Identified changes in individual car-based daily travel behavior between 2016-2018 and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021) across Germany and neighboring countries; highlights the need for improved data handling to assess net-zero carbon transitions.

**Limitations:** The original dataset had significant missing entries which required comprehensive data harmonization.

**Conclusion:** The study underlines the importance of sensor-based IoT technologies in traffic data collection and the potential for further analysis on pollution and land-use impacts from comprehensive road network data.

**Abstract:** Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights. Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg, the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so comprehensive data harmonization was performed.

**Keywords:** Conversational AI, Political Information, Misinformation, Public Opinion, Political Knowledge

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Study investigates the use of conversational AI for political information-seeking in the UK, finding that it can increase political knowledge without raising belief in misinformation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the use of conversational AI in political information-seeking and its impact on users' political knowledge during the 2024 election.

**Method:** Conducted a national survey with 2,499 participants and randomized controlled trials with 2,858 participants to assess the use of conversational AI for political information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated significant use of conversational AI for political inquiries among voters.
	2. Showed that interactions with AI enhance political knowledge without increasing misinformation beliefs.
	3. Provided empirical insights through a large-scale survey and controlled trials.

**Result:** 32% of chatbot users and 13% of eligible voters used conversational AI for political information; AI interactions increased political knowledge similar to traditional internet searches.

**Limitations:** The study is UK-focused and may not generalize to other political contexts or countries.

**Conclusion:** Conversational AI is increasingly used for political information in the UK but does not exacerbate belief in misinformation; users gain political knowledge from these interactions.

**Abstract:** Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users' political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions: First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users - and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues, models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing prevalence of deceptive patterns in digital interfaces manipulates user decisions and highlights the need for better user empowerment tools to recognize these patterns.

**Method:** AutoBot utilizes a two-staged pipeline that processes website screenshots to identify interactable elements and extract textual features, employing a custom language model to assess context for deception without relying on HTML structure.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an automated deceptive pattern detection system
	2. Real-time analysis of website interfaces without dependency on HTML
	3. Implementation as a local Chrome extension for privacy preservation

**Result:** AutoBot effectively identifies deceptive patterns in real-time, enhancing user awareness and supporting regulators in compliance assessments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The implementation of AutoBot as a lightweight Chrome extension demonstrates its capability to protect users and aid regulatory compliance while ensuring user privacy.

**Abstract:** Deceptive patterns (DPs) in digital interfaces manipulate users into making unintended decisions, exploiting cognitive biases and psychological vulnerabilities. These patterns have become ubiquitous across various digital platforms. While efforts to mitigate DPs have emerged from legal and technical perspectives, a significant gap in usable solutions that empower users to identify and make informed decisions about DPs in real-time remains. In this work, we introduce AutoBot, an automated, deceptive pattern detector that analyzes websites' visual appearances using machine learning techniques to identify and notify users of DPs in real-time. AutoBot employs a two-staged pipeline that processes website screenshots, identifying interactable elements and extracting textual features without relying on HTML structure. By leveraging a custom language model, AutoBot understands the context surrounding these elements to determine the presence of deceptive patterns. We implement AutoBot as a lightweight Chrome browser extension that performs all analyses locally, minimizing latency and preserving user privacy. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate AutoBot's effectiveness in enhancing users' ability to navigate digital environments safely while providing a valuable tool for regulators to assess and enforce compliance with DP regulations.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Multimodal Large Language Models, chart reasoning, visual reasoning, benchmark, human behavior

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding and reasoning with charts, proposing a new benchmark and an improved model, ChartReasoner, to enhance chart comprehension.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the alarming hallucinations and performance degradation of MLLMs when interpreting non-annotated charts and to evaluate their visual reasoning capabilities rigorously.

**Method:** The paper establishes a Chart Reasoning Benchmark (CRBench) to evaluate MLLMs' performance on chart reasoning and introduces the ChartReasoner model, which mimics human behavior for better chart understanding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the Chart Reasoning Benchmark (CRBench)
	2. Introduction of the ChartReasoner model that improves MLLMs' chart comprehension
	3. Demonstration of superior performance of ChartReasoner against state-of-the-art models.

**Result:** ChartReasoner-3B/7B outperforms existing models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash in chart reasoning tasks, demonstrating significantly improved visual reasoning and comprehension abilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of more reasoning processes in MLLMs, exemplified by ChartReasoner, is essential for enhancing their ability to understand charts rationally, with the tools and datasets being made publicly available.

**Abstract:** Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

**Abstract:** Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the strongest predictor of linking success.

**TL;DR:** The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) combines a powerful Multimodal Large Language Model with a small baseline model for efficient multimodal sentiment analysis, optimizing performance and resource use.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high computational demands of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve their efficiency for real-world deployment.

**Method:** A sample-difficulty-aware mechanism where a lightweight model filters inputs and escalates only uncertain cases to a more powerful MLLM, along with strategies for resolving conflicting predictions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) for multimodal sentiment analysis
	2. Development of a cascade mechanism for sample-difficulty-aware processing
	3. Implementation of strategies for handling ambiguous predictions

**Result:** The U-ACS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while significantly reducing computational resource requirements compared to using an MLLM alone.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed system allows for dynamic computational resource allocation, maintaining high accuracy while minimizing operational costs in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

**Abstract:** The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty, are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis. Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to using a standalone MLLM.

	3. Provided statistical validation of differences in task performance between dyslexic and non-dyslexic students.

**Result:** Significant differences in completion time for Silent Reading tests were found, with ML models achieving 87.5% accuracy for Italian, 66.6% for Spanish, and 75.0% for the pooled group.

**Limitations:** The accuracy varies by language, suggesting that results may not be universally applicable.

**Conclusion:** VR and ML can serve as effective tools for dyslexia assessment, highlighting the importance of task completion speed, although language-specific factors impact accuracy.

**Abstract:** This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The work provides a practical foundation for evaluating LLMs in the peer review process and aims to enhance the detection methods used in scholarly applications.

**Abstract:** The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing need for personality prediction from social media for applications in psychology and sociology drives innovation in leveraging LLMs, despite challenges.

**Method:** PtoP uses Retrieval Augmented Generation with in-context learning to reduce hallucination in LLMs and employs synthetic minority oversampling to address class imbalance in MBTI predictions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PtoP framework for MBTI prediction using LLMs.
	2. Use of Retrieval Augmented Generation to mitigate hallucination in predictions.
	3. Application of synthetic minority oversampling to resolve class imbalance issues.

**Result:** PtoP demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a social media dataset, surpassing 10 traditional ML and DL baselines in MBTI prediction accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed PtoP framework effectively addresses critical challenges in MBTI prediction, showcasing the utility of LLMs in psychological assessments from social media.

**Abstract:** Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently, the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content. However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges: the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the performance of GPT-5 and GPT-4o on a standardized BioNLP benchmark across multiple tasks, highlighting improvements in various NLP applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growing volume of biomedical literature necessitates efficient NLP solutions, and recent advancements in models like GPT-4 and GPT-5 warrant evaluation to understand their capabilities in BioNLP.

**Method:** The authors updated a BioNLP benchmark to assess GPT-5 and GPT-4o's performance using zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across 12 datasets and six task families.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Established benchmark for evaluating NLP models in biomedical literature
	2. Demonstrated GPT-5's strengths and weaknesses in various NLP tasks
	3. Provided insights into system design for BioNLP applications.

**Result:** GPT-5 achieved the highest scores on the benchmark, with notable gains on MedQA and extraction tasks, although it lagged in summarization and disease NER compared to domain-specific systems.

**Limitations:** Performance in summarization and disease NER still lags behind specialized systems; the benchmark may not encompass all biomedical NLP challenges.

**Conclusion:** GPT-5 demonstrates significant advancements for biomedical question answering, while extraction and summarization tasks still benefit from more specialized models, suggesting a need for hybrid approaches.

**Abstract:** The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering, its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached 94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734). In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines. These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as frontier models advance.

**Keywords:** Large language models, Uncertainty diagnosis, Ambiguity analysis

**TL;DR:** This study diagnoses sources of uncertainty in large language models by analyzing disagreement patterns in multiple generated responses.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** While LLMs have made significant progress, their uncertainty poses challenges; understanding the source of this uncertainty is crucial.

**Method:** We collect multiple responses from a target LLM and use an auxiliary LLM to analyze the disagreement patterns to identify sources of uncertainty.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a framework for diagnosing uncertainty in LLMs using response patterns.
	2. Validates the framework on standard datasets to demonstrate effectiveness.
	3. Identifies specific missing facts or concepts related to knowledge gaps.

**Result:** The framework was validated on datasets like AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its ability to diagnose uncertainty sources effectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Understanding uncertainty sources can lead to manual interventions that enhance LLM performance and reliability.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that, when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question, a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper examines the role of emotional expressions in conflict resolution using automatic text emotion recognition, revealing that large-language models are more effective than previous methods in understanding emotional intensity and outcomes in dispute dialogues.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how emotional expressions impact conflict resolution and whether text emotion recognition can enhance understanding of this influence.

**Method:** The study analyzes a large dataset of buyer-seller dispute dialogues, applying large-language models for emotion intensity annotation and comparison to human annotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of effective automatic text emotion recognition in dispute contexts
	2. Comparison of large-language models with traditional methods for emotion annotation
	3. Insights into the relationship between emotional expressions and conflict outcomes

**Result:** The findings indicate that emotional expressions significantly shape both subjective and objective outcomes in conflicts, with large-language models providing superior explanatory power.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to buyer-seller disputes and may not generalize to other types of conflicts.

**Conclusion:** The research supports theories on emotional contributions to conflict dynamics and suggests potential applications of agent-based systems for managing emotional escalation in disputes.

**Abstract:** In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts' thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes. We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional escalation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the timing and transformation of task representations in language models during in-context learning.

**Method:** The authors analyze the evolution of transferrable task representations and their alignment with performance improvements across varying contextual examples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigated the timing of transferrable task representation formation in language models.
	2. Demonstrated the non-monotonic evolution of these representations throughout context.
	3. Outlined the dual locality (temporal and semantic) in how language models adapt to new tasks.

**Result:** Findings indicate that task representations evolve sporadically and are distinct from static high-level task categories, operating effectively in a local and context-dependent manner.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights a 'just-in-time' computational approach in language models for adapting to tasks through localized representation evolution.

**Abstract:** Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate \emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and \emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on ''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'', such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks. This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

**Motivation:** The deployment of large language models is limited by high computational and memory costs, making efficient methods for pruning essential.

**Method:** The proposed method constructs pruning and distillation sets for iterative block removal independently in the prefill and decode stages, along with a token-aware cache pruning mechanism.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel pruning method tailored for PD disaggregation inference.
	2. Token-aware cache pruning mechanism that reduces communication costs.
	3. Iterative block removal strategy for separate prefill and decode stages.

**Result:** The method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption, demonstrating strong performance in both PD disaggregation and unified settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach offers an effective means to optimize large language models, improving their efficiency without significant performance loss.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities: multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.   We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation, significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial certification evaluation.   Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and cost-performance optimization.

However, existing approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets, approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86 with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

*Kaustubh Shivshankar Shejole, Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** stereotypes, AI, stereotypical bias, benchmark dataset, social psychology

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study addresses the challenge of detecting stereotypes and anti-stereotypes, proposing a new benchmark dataset called StereoDetect to advance research in this critical area.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Stereotypes can have harmful effects, and understanding the distinction between stereotypes and stereotypical biases is crucial for responsible AI research.

**Method:** The paper proposes a five-tuple definition to clarify the terms related to stereotypes and creates a benchmark dataset, StereoDetect, that aligns with this definition for better detection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a clear framework and definitions for stereotypes and biases.
	2. Developed the StereoDetect benchmark dataset for improved stereotype detection.
	3. Identified limitations in existing detection models and benchmarks.

**Result:** Identified shortcomings in existing benchmarks and demonstrated that existing models struggle with stereotype detection, specifically misclassifying anti-stereotypes.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on stereotypes in language models, which may limit applicability to other forms of media.

**Conclusion:** StereoDetect provides an effective tool for advancing research in stereotype detection, highlighted by qualitative and quantitative comparisons with previous benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** intent detection, conversational assistants, large language models, dialogue systems, agent planning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces RECAP, a benchmark for evaluating intent rewriting in conversational agents powered by LLMs, aiming to improve planning in ambiguous dialogues.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Effective planning in conversational assistants requires understanding user intent, which is challenging due to the ambiguity and complexity of real-world dialogues.

**Method:** RECAP is a new benchmark for intent rewriting that reformulates dialogues into concise representations of user goals, alongside an LLM-based evaluator for assessing planning utility.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the RECAP benchmark for evaluating intent rewriting.
	2. Development of a prompt-based rewriting approach that improves planning utility.
	3. Introduction of an LLM-based evaluator for assessing rewritten intents.

**Result:** The proposed prompt-based rewriting approach outperforms existing baselines, and fine-tuning DPO-based rewriters shows further improvements in utility.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Intent rewriting is identified as an essential and manageable component that can significantly enhance planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

**Abstract:** Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

**Read time:** 9 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore a novel interaction paradigm for LLM agents that involves passive assistance rather than active participation.

**Method:** An in-depth study utilizing large multimodal audio-language models was conducted, focusing on their ability to act as overhearing agents in Dungeons & Dragons sessions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the overhearing agents paradigm
	2. Application in Dungeons & Dragons gameplay
	3. Release of Python libraries and project code for further research

**Result:** The study found that certain large audio-language models can effectively perform overhearing tasks using implicit audio cues, as confirmed by human evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate the potential for overhearing agents to enhance human interactions by providing background assistance without direct engagement.

**Abstract:** Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

**Conclusion:** The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements with fewer parameters and enhances LLM optimization techniques with notable SLUE score advancements.

**Abstract:** While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, speculative decoding, test-time scaling

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating speculative decoding methods in enhancing LLM test-time scaling efficiency.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Test-time scaling aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, but it suffers from inefficiencies due to redundant data generation. Speculative decoding could mitigate this inefficiency, yet its application in this context is underexplored.

**Method:** The authors developed a comprehensive benchmark that allows for fair comparisons across key speculative decoding methods (model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based) within different test-time scaling paradigms such as Best-of-N sampling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first benchmark for speculative decoding in test-time scaling.
	2. Demonstration of the effectiveness of n-gram-based methods in handling repetitions.
	3. Promotion of integrating different speculative decoding approaches.

**Result:** Experiments showed that n-gram-based methods excel at recognizing repetitive patterns, potentially accelerating test-time scaling more effectively than other methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating n-gram-based techniques with model-based or training-based methods can strike a balance for efficient reasoning in LLMs, highlighting paths for further research in speculative decoding.

**Abstract:** Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces, leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods. Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, thought parallelism, reasoning paths, machine learning, tunnel vision

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** ParaThinker introduces native thought parallelism to enhance reasoning in LLMs by generating multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, overcoming limitations of traditional sequential scaling.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the limitations encountered with scaling computation in LLMs, particularly the 'Tunnel Vision' phenomenon that hampers model performance.

**Method:** The authors propose an end-to-end framework called ParaThinker, which allows LLMs to generate multiple reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize their results.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of native thought parallelism for LLMs
	2. Development of the ParaThinker framework
	3. Demonstration of substantial accuracy gains with minor latency increases

**Result:** ParaThinker achieves up to 12.3% improvement in accuracy over sequential LLMs with minimal latency overhead.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of parallel thinking for efficient reasoning in LLMs, demonstrating that it allows smaller models to outperform larger ones.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer, sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width) is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5% for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient dimension for scaling future LLMs.

**Motivation:** To improve text-to-molecule models' ability to capture global structural contexts within molecules by addressing the limitations of atom-level tokenizations.

**Method:** Development of a novel model called Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5), employing substructure-level tokenization and an importance-based training strategy that emphasizes key substructures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of substructure-level tokenization for molecular understanding
	2. Implementation of an importance-based training strategy
	3. Demonstration of performance improvements over state-of-the-art models with reduced training data

**Result:** CAMT5 outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-molecule models while utilizing only 2% of the training tokens, demonstrating improved generation performance through a new ensemble strategy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed CAMT5 model significantly enhances text-to-molecule generation capabilities and provides an effective approach for leveraging structural context in molecular data.

**Abstract:** Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However, they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks. Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to further boost the generation performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Songhyeontae/CAMT5.git.

The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

**Keywords:** rare tokens, large language models, specialized neurons

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the mechanisms behind rare token prediction in large language models, revealing that processing requires additional specialized neurons and exhibits a distributed organization.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how rare token prediction is handled in large language models and the functional organization of specialized neurons involved.

**Method:** The authors used neuron influence analyses, graph-based clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models to study rare token processing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of additional plateau neurons necessary for rare token processing.
	2. Discovery of spatial distribution of plateau neurons rather than modular clustering.
	3. Insights into attention mechanisms not favoring specialized routing.

**Result:** The study found that: 1) rare token processing relies on extra plateau neurons, forming dual computational regimes; 2) these neurons are distributed spatially rather than clustered; and 3) there is no preferential routing in attention mechanisms to these specialized neurons.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Rare token specialization results from distributed differentiation influenced by training, allowing for flexibility while maintaining capacity allocation.

**Abstract:** Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized ``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

**Result:** The method demonstrates improved performance in personalized VER compared to conventional multi-modal models, addressing their tendency to prefer majority viewpoints.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the approach may vary across different emotional contexts and individual differences in emotion expression.

**Conclusion:** Personalized VER can be effectively achieved through prompt tuning of MLLMs, opening new avenues for practical applications.

**Abstract:** Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design. Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of accurate personalized VER.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents an energy-based model (EBM) for reliable abstention in retrieval-augmented generation systems, particularly in critical health domains, outperforming traditional methods in hard case scenarios.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the reliability of responses in retrieval-augmented generation systems, particularly in safety-critical areas like women's health, where incorrect information can lead to harm.

**Method:** An energy-based model (EBM) is developed and benchmarked against a calibrated softmax baseline and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) heuristic for decision making on when to generate or abstain.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an energy-based model for reliable abstention in RAG systems.
	2. Empirical evidence showing the EBM's superior performance in semantically challenging queries compared to traditional methods.
	3. Insights on the role of energy scoring in enhancing decision-making robustness.

**Result:** The EBM effectively achieved an AUROC of 0.961 in hard semantic cases compared to 0.950 for softmax, with a lower false positive rate, demonstrating superior abstention performance, especially in safety-critical situations.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on the evaluation of the model in specific domains and may not generalize to all types of queries or non-critical domains.

**Conclusion:** Energy-based scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal for abstention decisions in RAG systems, enhancing safety and interpretability in critical fields such as health informatics.

**Abstract:** Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives, performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems.

**Result:** The approach establishes metrics for assessing completeness, correctness, and semantic entropy, leading to improved reliability and effectiveness in fact-checking systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DecMetrics sets a benchmark for claim decomposition quality evaluation, contributing to better fact-checking methodologies.

**Abstract:** Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics: \texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY}, designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

**Result:** The fine-tuned models achieved human-like agreement levels in evaluating review comments and generating rationales, often surpassing existing advanced models like GPT-4o, yet machine-generated reviews typically fell short compared to human feedback.

**Limitations:** The study highlights that despite improvements, machine-generated reviews have limitations compared to human reviews in several aspects.

**Conclusion:** While automated systems can provide valuable assessments of review comments, human reviews still offer superior insights in certain aspects of feedback.

**Abstract:** Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews, automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding & Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with 10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

**Conclusion:** The phenotype-based tokenization approach not only improves model interpretability but also increases computational efficiency in predicting cardiovascular risks.

**Abstract:** We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens, achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442 tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842, all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

### [41] [Serialized Output Prompting for Large Language Model-based Multi-Talker Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04488)

*Hao Shi, Yusuke Fujita, Tomoya Mizumoto, Lianbo Liu, Atsushi Kojima, Yui Sudo*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multi-talker ASR, large language models, serialized output prompts, speech recognition, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a new method for improving LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems by using structured serialized output prompts (SOP).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems either lack prompt designs or only use simple prompts, which limit their performance. This work seeks to design better prompts to enhance the system's capabilities.

**Method:** The proposed method involves extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and leveraging structured prompts to guide the LLM. It includes a Separator and serialized CTC layers to extract MT content and utilizes a three-stage training strategy: serialized output training (SOT) fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced SOP for better prompt design in ASR systems
	2. Developed a three-stage training strategy for multi-talker conditions
	3. Demonstrated improved performance in complex multi-talker scenarios

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that the SOP approach notably improves performance in both two-talker and three-talker scenarios compared to traditional methods.

**Limitations:** While effective in specific scenarios, the model's ability to generalize across all multi-talker conditions remains to be evaluated.

**Conclusion:** SOP-MT-ASR enhances the LLMs' effectiveness in handling multi-talker ASR tasks, showcasing a significant performance boost under more complex talker conditions.

**Abstract:** Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP, which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT) fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under both two- and three-talker conditions.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Automatic Speech Recognition, Weakly Supervised Learning, TV Subtitles

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** This study presents a novel method for using TV subtitles within a weakly supervised ASR framework, focusing on improving transcription accuracy through context-rich prompts and a weighted attention mechanism.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this study is to improve the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems by utilizing readily available TV subtitles, which are often imprecisely aligned with audio. The aim is to leverage these subtitles as prompts instead of direct supervision to enhance transcription quality.

**Method:** The proposed methodology involves treating TV subtitles as context-rich prompts rather than as direct targets for verbatim transcription. It utilizes a weighted attention mechanism that highlights relevant subtitle tokens during the inference process, allowing the model to iteratively refine generated pseudo transcripts based on the guiding cues provided by the subtitles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a new approach using TV subtitles as context-rich prompts in ASR.
	2. Introduced a weighted attention mechanism for better targeting of relevant subtitle tokens.
	3. Demonstrated improved transcription accuracy through experimental validation.

**Result:** Experimental results show significant improvements in transcription accuracy by employing the proposed method. The introduction of enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets leads to the development of more robust ASR systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that reimagining TV subtitles as guiding cues significantly enhances the transcription process in ASR, providing valuable datasets for future model training.

**Abstract:** This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead, generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Hallucinations, Question Answering, Entropy Production Rate, Supervised Learning

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a one-shot methodology for hallucination detection in LLM outputs, enhancing QA task reliability using limited data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the critical issue of hallucinations in LLM outputs for Question Answering tasks, particularly in scenarios with restricted data access.

**Method:** The methodology involves deriving uncertainty indicators from available log-probabilities during non-greedy decoding, employing an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) baseline augmented with supervised learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a one-shot hallucination detection method for LLMs
	2. Introduction of an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric augmented with supervised learning
	3. Demonstration of high performance using only a small set of log-probabilities

**Result:** The proposed model significantly improves hallucination detection performance over the EPR baseline when evaluated on various QA datasets and LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The technique offers practical efficiency for deploying trustworthiness enhancements in LLM responses using limited generated log-probabilities, with demonstrated utility in a finance framework.

**Abstract:** Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering (QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection, specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top <10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on annual reports from an industrial dataset.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address clinician burnout in high-acuity ICUs and utilize clinical narratives for monitoring well-being.

**Method:** A hybrid pipeline using BioBERT sentiment embeddings, a clinician burnout lexicon, and LDA with workload proxies to classify burnout risk.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a hybrid NLP pipeline for clinician burnout monitoring.
	2. Use of clinical narratives for actionable insights into provider well-being.
	3. Identification of burnout risk in specific medical specialties.

**Result:** Achieved precision of 0.80, recall of 0.89, and F1 score of 0.84, improving over metadata-only approaches by at least 0.17 in F1 score.

**Limitations:** The study is based on a specific dataset (MIMIC-IV) and may not generalize to all clinical settings or different healthcare environments.

**Conclusion:** Clinical narratives in ICU discharge summaries provide actionable insights for proactive monitoring of clinician well-being.

**Abstract:** Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR) metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1 score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive well-being monitoring.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates biases in university recommendations made by Open-Source LLMs, revealing systemic favoritism towards the Global North and gender stereotypes. It proposes a novel evaluation framework for measuring demographic and geographic representation in recommendations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing use of LLMs in educational recommendation systems raises concerns about the perpetuation of societal biases.

**Method:** The study analyzes recommendations from three LLMs using 360 simulated user profiles with varying demographics, examining over 25,000 outputs for bias.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical analysis of biases in LLM-driven educational recommendations
	2. Development of a novel evaluation framework for demographic and geographic representation
	3. Quantitative evidence of bias in LLM suggestions across diverse user profiles

**Result:** The analysis reveals strong biases towards institutions in the Global North, reinforcement of gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition in recommendations, with LLaMA-3.1 exhibiting the highest diversity.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to three specific LLMs and does not explore bias in higher education beyond university recommendations.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the need for a multi-dimensional evaluation framework to address and mitigate biases in LLM educational recommendations, ensuring fair access to higher education.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure equitable global access to higher education.

**TL;DR:** DeepTRACE is an audit framework designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of generative search engines and deep research LLM agents by measuring their citation practices and evidence attribution.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices in generative search engines and LLMs, highlighting the need for effective auditing mechanisms.

**Method:** The methodology involves a sociotechnically grounded audit framework, DeepTRACE, which analyzes eight measurable dimensions of output based on statement-level analysis, confidence scoring, and citation matrices.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the DeepTRACE audit framework
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of generative systems and deep research configurations
	3. Identification of common failures in citation practices and evidence attribution

**Result:** The evaluation of several popular models revealed that generative systems often provide overly confident, one-sided responses and include unsupported statements, although deep-research configurations show improved citation thoroughness.

**Limitations:** The study sample is limited to specific models and may not comprehensively represent all generative search engines or deep research agents.

**Conclusion:** While deep-research configurations can reduce overconfidence and improve citation accuracy, they still demonstrate high levels of one-sidedness and unsupported statements.

**Abstract:** Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy, source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources, and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition, confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com, Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) process and prioritize mixed contexts, revealing vulnerabilities to inappropriate content, and introduces a novel approach called RW-Steering to enhance LLM response quality and safety.

**Read time:** 36 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the impact of mixed, real-world contexts on the response quality of LLMs and address the reliability risks posed by inappropriate content.

**Method:** The study introduces the Poisoned Context Testbed paired with the Rescorla-Wagner model to quantify the influence of competing contextual signals on LLM outputs, leading to the development of RW-Steering, a fine-tuning approach to mitigate the impact of inappropriate content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Poisoned Context Testbed for evaluating LLMs
	2. Adaptation of the Rescorla-Wagner model for context prioritization in LLMs
	3. Development of RW-Steering for improving response quality by mitigating inappropriate content

**Result:** Empirical evaluations confirm that LLMs tend to incorporate information that is less prevalent in their context, exposing them to risks; RW-Steering improves response quality by 39.8% and helps the model ignore inappropriate information.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RW-Steering is a robust and generalizable technique for enhancing LLM safety and response quality in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality. Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve, establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of VaccineRAG dataset for evaluating LLM weaknesses in retrieval tasks.
	2. Development of Partial-GRPO for improved learning of complex Chain-of-Thought content.
	3. Validation through comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies.

**Result:** Comprehensive evaluations show that VaccineRAG enhances the generation capacity of LLMs by improving their ability to learn from complex Chain-of-Thought content and effectively addressing retriever-induced inaccuracies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of VaccineRAG and Partial-GRPO represents significant strides in enhancing LLM accuracy through improved retrieval mechanisms and detailed analysis, making it a valuable resource for further research in the field.

**Abstract:** Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a "Behavioral Fingerprinting" framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) based on their behavioral characteristics, uncovering significant differences in alignment-related behaviors among models despite converging core capabilities.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing benchmarks for LLMs that focus primarily on performance metrics and neglect nuanced behavioral differences.

**Method:** The paper develops a multi-faceted profiling framework using a Diagnostic Prompt Suite and an automated evaluation pipeline where an LLM serves as an impartial judge, analyzing eighteen different LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Behavioral Fingerprinting framework
	2. Discovery of significant behavioral differences among LLMs
	3. Documentation of cross-model persona clustering related to alignment incentives.

**Result:** The study finds that while core capabilities converge, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness exhibit significant variation among models, with discovered persona clustering reflecting common alignment strategies.

**Limitations:** The framework's interpretation of alignment-related behaviors may still require additional validation through real-world interactions.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that the interactive nature of LLMs results from specific developer alignment strategies rather than purely from model scale or reasoning abilities, and the framework offers a scalable method for uncovering these differences.

**Abstract:** Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel ``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together, this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences. Project: https://github.com/JarvisPei/Behavioral-Fingerprinting

**Conclusion:** Combining a transformer and an LLM significantly improves the recognition accuracy of speech generated by SSIs, addressing critical challenges in this area.

**Abstract:** Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech, which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM) for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline, demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech interfaces.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To compare the performance of multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) against single-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) in solving complex problems.

**Method:** The research involves instantiating both single and multi-agent systems within the AppWorld environment using language models of varying sizes, employing a progressive sub-task training strategy to enhance learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of progressive sub-task training strategy
	2. Comparison of performance between SLMs and LLMs in multi-agent systems
	3. Demonstration of improved effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs in fine-tuned configurations

**Result:** Findings reveal that SLMs struggle with long-trajectory learning, ultimately limiting their performance, while the proposed training strategy improves multi-agent effectiveness across all configurations.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the AppWorld environment, which may limit generalizability to other domains.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of a progressive sub-task training strategy significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-agent systems, suggesting its value in future applications.

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off, we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the AppWorld environment using different sized language models.   We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles, SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce subtask error rates.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates using virtual reality and machine learning to predict dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students, finding significant differences in reading task completion times.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore new methodologies for predicting dyslexia using VR and AI, specifically focusing on university students' reading performance and self-esteem.

**Method:** Participants underwent VR-based Silent Reading tests and self-esteem assessments followed by statistical analyses (t tests, Mann Whitney tests) and supervised ML models to classify dyslexia presence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of VR-based assessments for dyslexia
	2. Demonstration of ML classification accuracy in a bilingual context
	3. Identification of the importance of task completion speed in dyslexia detection

**Result:** The analysis revealed significant differences in completion time for the Silent Reading test based on dyslexia status, with ML models achieving 87.5% accuracy for Italian and 66.6% for Spanish classifications.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by the accuracy variability across languages and may not consider other dyslexia-related factors besides completion time.

**Conclusion:** VR and machine learning can be effective in assessing dyslexia by identifying discrepancies in task completion speed, albeit with potential language influences on accuracy.

**Abstract:** This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To build safe and reliable systems for emotionally sensitive content, particularly in mental health contexts.

**Method:** The authors created a dataset by merging human-authored mental health datasets and augmenting them with emotion reinterpretation prompts. They evaluated four LLaMA models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel dataset constructed for emotional safety classification
	2. Demonstrated effective scaling behavior of LLMs in mental health applications
	3. Highlighted potential for smaller models in privacy-preserving contexts

**Result:** Larger LLMs performed better on average, especially in nuanced classification tasks. However, a lightweight fine-tuning of the 1B model achieved competitive performance while requiring minimal VRAM.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Smaller models can provide privacy-preserving alternatives for interpreting emotional context and maintaining safety in sensitive applications.

**Abstract:** Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs. borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance, particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings. However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller, on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the pervasive issues of gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated content, particularly in occupational narratives.

**Method:** The proposed method, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME), uses explanations generated by language models to inform prompt engineering, aiming to reduce bias in the output across multiple demographics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BAME as a bias mitigation strategy
	2. Demonstrated significant improvements in demographic representation
	3. Analysis of biases across three large language models in diverse occupational contexts

**Result:** Improvements in demographic representation were observed, ranging from 2% to 20% across various occupational groups after applying the BAME strategy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Guiding AI models using their own reasoning mechanisms contributes to a reduction in representation biases and fosters more transparent AI systems.

**Abstract:** Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories. Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME), revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%. BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes. Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, multilingual capabilities, AI equity, Native language training, System performance

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study investigates performance disparities between monolingual BERT models trained on Swahili and English data, highlighting the importance of native-language training.

**Read time:** 13 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore equity in AI performance across different languages, particularly focusing on how English dominance in training data affects non-English speakers.

**Method:** The study compares two monolingual BERT models—one trained on Swahili news data and the other on English news data. It evaluates the performance by translating Swahili inputs into English for testing on the English model and comparing it with direct testing on the Swahili-trained model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the limitations of cross-lingual evaluation methods using translation.
	2. Highlights the essential need for training models in underrepresented languages to ensure fairness.
	3. Sparks a discussion on the implications of AI deployment on digital divides.

**Result:** The Swahili-trained model outperformed the Swahili-to-English translated model, yielding only 0.36% errors compared to 1.47%, indicating that translation does not bridge representational differences effectively.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on two languages and may not generalize to all multilingual contexts or other model architectures.

**Conclusion:** Native-language training is crucial for reliable model performance, especially in educational and informational contexts to reduce inequality.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data, and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili, thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47% respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge representational differences between languages and that models trained in one language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality. Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing digital divides is reduced.

This study analyzes patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling, postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance patient care.

**Motivation:** The growing importance of tool use in Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world tasks underscores the need for more efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) that can also utilize external resources effectively.

**Method:** The paper employs Reinforcement Learning, specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to improve tool-use capabilities in SLMs, aiming for a method that is more efficient than traditional fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of GRPO to improve tool use in Small Language Models
	2. Demonstration of enhanced SLM performance in real-time data retrieval and problem-solving
	3. Analysis of SLM limitations and how GRPO addresses them

**Result:** The proposed method significantly boosts the accuracy of tool use in SLMs, thereby enhancing their practical applications without the heavy computational requirements of LLMs.

**Limitations:** While the method shows improved SLM tool-use proficiency, further research is needed to evaluate its performance across diverse applications and datasets.

**Conclusion:** By using GRPO, SLMs can achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in tool use, bridging the performance gap with LLMs and increasing their applicability across various tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs, databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations, making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or automated workflows.   However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.   This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy, increasing their practical utility.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HSMP-BERT presents a scalable approach for structured extraction in radiology, facilitating population-level analysis of Crohn's disease in low-resource settings.

**Abstract:** Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90 structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66% train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24 organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1 0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning (F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$). Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference. Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening, stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

**Conclusion:** The research lays a foundation for developing controllable and robust language models, raising ethical considerations regarding dual-use risks and evaluation standards.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts, activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects. Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation. This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language models.

**Limitations:** Limited datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech and a need for more diverse cultural perspectives.

**Conclusion:** Highlights the necessity for more research on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition and stresses addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon.

**Abstract:** Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch, speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition, charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather than a text-based challenge.

*Osman Batur İnce, André F. T. Martins, Oisin Mac Aodha, Edoardo M. Ponti*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal models, sample-efficient integration, large language models

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Introduces SEMI, a sample-efficient method for integrating new modalities into Large Language Models using a hypernetwork.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The vast and evolving nature of modalities makes it impractical to train models from scratch. Moreover, integrating new modalities often requires extensive paired data, which is scarce for low-resource types.

**Method:** SEMI uses a hypernetwork to adapt a shared projector for modality integration, conditioned on a few samples during inference, and boosts modality training diversity through isometric transformations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a hypernetwork for sample-efficient modality integration into LLMs
	2. Achieved significant sample efficiency improvements for few-shot modality integration
	3. Demonstrated the ability to integrate low-resource modalities effectively.

**Result:** Achieves significant gains in sample efficiency for few-shot integration, allowing for effective integration of low-resource modalities such as satellite and astronomical images with much less data than traditional methods require.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SEMI extends the modality coverage of foundation models, facilitating the integration of previously underrepresented modalities with a fraction of the usual data.

**Abstract:** Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover, integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector -- placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio, video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e., satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules) with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs 64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality coverage of foundation models.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** disaster response, transformer models, tweet classification, machine learning, public safety

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the effectiveness of transformer models for classifying disaster-related tweets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional ML models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance emergency response efforts through improved classification of disaster-related tweets using advanced machine learning techniques.

**Method:** The paper compares traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) with transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) for classifying tweets during disasters.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of transformer models for disaster tweet classification
	2. Comparison with traditional machine learning approaches
	3. Demonstration of improved performance and contextual understanding with transformers

**Result:** BERT achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, both at 82%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Transformer architectures provide superior accuracy and understanding of nuanced language, making them more suitable for disaster-related social media applications.

**Abstract:** Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** out-of-domain detection, large language models, anomaly detection, dropout tolerance, ICAD

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** We introduce a novel OOD detection algorithm for large language models (LLMs) that improves performance by leveraging dropout tolerance and Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD).

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Specialized LLMs are vulnerable to incorrect outputs with out-of-domain (OOD) inputs, which poses risks in critical applications such as health informatics.

**Method:** The proposed method uses a non-conformity measure based on dropout tolerance and aggregates dropout tolerance across multiple layers using a valid ensemble approach to improve OOD detection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new non-conformity measure for OOD detection based on dropout tolerance.
	2. Demonstration of improved OOD detection performance in medical-specialized LLMs.
	3. Maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD during the detection process.

**Result:** Experiments show that the new approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 2% to 37% for medical-specialized LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that the approach effectively detects OOD inputs while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds, making it suitable for critical applications.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates hallucination in Arabic and multilingual LLMs for generative question answering and summarization tasks, revealing higher factual hallucinations compared to faithfulness errors.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underexplored area of hallucination in LLMs specifically for the Arabic language, given its wide use and importance in global contexts.

**Method:** A fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework with 12 indicators was developed to assess 12 LLMs, including Arabic, multilingual, and reasoning-based models, across generative question answering and summarization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comprehensive evaluation of hallucination in Arabic LLMs
	2. Development of a fine-grained evaluation framework with 12 indicators
	3. Performance comparison of various LLM models in Arabic context

**Result:** The study found that factual hallucinations were more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks, with the Arabic pre-trained model Allam showing the lowest hallucination rates.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for improved evaluation frameworks and underline the performance of Arabic models in mitigating hallucination effects compared to multilingual ones.

**Abstract:** Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

**Keywords:** Natural Language to SQL, NL2SQL, paraphrasing, robustness, evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new framework for evaluating NL2SQL models' robustness to linguistic variation using paraphrased queries, revealing significant drops in performance for state-of-the-art models.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of robust evaluation of NL2SQL models in the face of linguistic variation, which existing benchmarks fail to systematically consider.

**Method:** The authors propose a schema-aligned paraphrasing framework that generates semantically equivalent, lexically diverse SQL queries and evaluates NL2SQL model robustness using these queries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel framework for paraphrasing SQL queries to evaluate NL2SQL robustness
	2. Demonstrates significant performance drops in existing models with paraphrased queries
	3. Identifies variation in robustness linked to query complexity and dataset

**Result:** Analysis shows that state-of-the-art models like LLaMa3.3-70B experience over 10% drop in execution accuracy with paraphrased queries, proving they are more brittle than previously thought.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the urgent need for better evaluation frameworks that measure linguistic generalization to improve the reliability of NL2SQL models in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries, while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to 42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable performance in real-world settings.

### [70] [Why Language Models Hallucinate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** language models, hallucinations, uncertainty, evaluation, AI trustworthiness

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses the issue of 'hallucinations' in large language models, asserting that these errors stem from training and evaluation methods that incentivize guessing over acknowledging uncertainty.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the reasons behind hallucinations in large language models and their impact on trust in AI systems.

**Method:** The paper analyzes statistical causes of hallucinations within the training pipeline and critiques the evaluation procedures that prioritize performance over accurate representations of uncertainty.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of the root cause of hallucinations in training methods.
	2. Proposal for modifying evaluation benchmarks to discourage guessing under uncertainty.
	3. Analysis of how current testing practices misalign with the need for trustworthy AI.

**Result:** Language models are found to hallucinate due to statistical pressures in binary classification problems, as incorrect guesses are not effectively differentiated from correct facts during training and evaluation.

**Limitations:** The approach may not address all forms of AI uncertainty, and modifications to benchmarks could face resistance from the community.

**Conclusion:** To reduce hallucinations, existing evaluation methods must be modified to reward uncertainty instead of guessing, leading to more trustworthy AI systems.

**Abstract:** Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

**Conclusion:** ODKE+ demonstrates that LLM-guided extraction workflows can enhance knowledge graph reliability and scalability across diverse applications.

**Abstract:** Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+, a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195 predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9 million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability.

**TL;DR:** This study examines the effectiveness of phonological inductive biases in improving isolated sign recognition and unseen sign reconstruction using a vector-quantized autoencoder.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Sign language datasets often lack vocabulary representation, necessitating models that can generalize to unseen signs.

**Method:** The research investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement and Phonological Semi-Supervision, applied to a vector-quantized autoencoder.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Parameter Disentanglement as an architectural bias
	2. Implementation of Phonological Semi-Supervision as a regularization technique
	3. Quantitative analysis showing improved generalization in sign language models

**Result:** The proposed model demonstrates improved one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and enhanced discrimination for sign identification compared to a baseline model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can significantly enhance the generalization capabilities of sign language representation models.

**Abstract:** Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary, underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement, an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign language.

**Conclusion:** Optimizing LLM architectures and fine-tuning approaches is critical for developing effective patient information extraction systems in clinical settings.

**Abstract:** Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs (BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1, GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out strategy.

**Motivation:** The challenge of accurately answering complex questions has been a significant issue for LLMs, prompting the exploration of structured approaches to enhance their reasoning capabilities.

**Method:** The authors developed a multi-hop question decomposition method within the MQUAKE framework, utilizing the LLAMA3 model, and compared performance using both a single-hop and a multi-hop dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-hop question decomposition approach
	2. Evaluation of its effect on the LLAMA3 model performance
	3. Comparison between single-hop and multi-hop datasets

**Result:** Results show that the multi-hop question decomposition method significantly outperformed direct answering of complex questions, especially after fine-tuning the LLM using LoRA.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The multi-hop decomposition method is effective in enhancing LLMs' performance in answering complex questions, both pre- and post-training.

**Abstract:** Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions, building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model, we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions. After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex questions.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, humor, NLP, GPT-4o, RoBERTa

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates whether LLMs, specifically a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o), understand humor and compares its performance to fine-tuned encoders.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the understanding of humor by LLMs and assess their performance in natural language tasks.

**Method:** The paper compares the performance of a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) against a fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa) on humor comprehension, using Mean F1-macro scores as a metric.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the concept of humor understanding in LLMs
	2. Demonstrates competitive performance of GPT-4o in humor tasks
	3. Compares LLM outputs with human communication effectiveness.

**Result:** The fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) achieved a Mean F1-macro score of 0.85, showing competitive performance against the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa) with a score of 0.86.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results suggest that fine-tuned LLMs are capable of understanding and processing humor to a significant extent, raising further questions about their comprehension of nuanced language.

**Abstract:** From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills. Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Diversity, Determinantal Point Processes, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces DQO, a novel training method to enhance the semantic diversity of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining quality by employing determinantal point processes (DPPs).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to improve the output diversity of large language models after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, which often leads to narrower responses.

**Method:** The proposed DQO method samples and embeds a group of responses for each prompt, measuring diversity using the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel training method for LLMs that enhances response diversity.
	2. Use of determinantal point processes (DPPs) in LLM fine-tuning to measure and improve semantic diversity.
	3. Demonstration of improved performance on various NLP tasks without sacrificing model quality.

**Result:** Experiments show that the DQO method significantly improves semantic diversity across various tasks, including instruction-following and story generation, without compromising model quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DQO successfully enhances the performance of LLMs by balancing quality and semantic diversity, making it a valuable approach for NLP applications.

**Abstract:** Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses. Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic diversity without sacrificing model quality.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) using the Big Five traits, comparing approaches like in-context learning and fine-tuning to understand their trade-offs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To clarify the mechanisms and trade-offs involved in personality manipulation in LLMs, particularly in customer service and agentic scenarios.

**Method:** The authors conducted a systematic study utilizing a contrastive dataset, a unified evaluation framework, trait purification techniques, and a stability framework to assess personality control methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Constructed a contrastive dataset for effective personality steering evaluation.
	2. Introduced a unified evaluation framework for disentangling various performance metrics.
	3. Developed trait purification techniques to clarify personality trait overlaps.

**Result:** The experiments demonstrated that in-context learning (ICL) provides strong alignment with minimal capability loss, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) achieves the highest alignment at the cost of performance, and mechanistic steering (MS) offers lightweight control with competitive effectiveness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that personality manipulation serves as a valuable probe into behavioral representation, connecting conditioning methods, encoding, and control mechanisms while positioning MS as a feasible alternative to fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles, reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU, GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and interpretability.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, knowledge collapse, synthetic training, factual accuracy, task-centric metrics

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper addresses knowledge collapse in large language models due to synthetic data reliance, proposing solutions for improved training.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The reliance on synthetic data can lead to knowledge collapse in language models, threatening factual accuracy, which is crucial in knowledge-intensive applications.

**Method:** The authors conducted controlled experiments on recursive synthetic training to examine the relationship between instruction format and model collapse.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition of knowledge collapse in language models
	2. Identification of instruction-following collapse as distinct from traditional model collapse
	3. Proposition of domain-specific synthetic training as a mitigation strategy

**Result:** They identified a three-stage knowledge collapse phenomenon and demonstrated that the timing of collapse is influenced by instruction format, proposing domain-specific synthetic training as a remedy.

**Limitations:** The research may not cover all language models or training contexts comprehensively.

**Conclusion:** The study offers insights into the dynamics of knowledge collapse and practical strategies for improving the sustainability of AI training focusing on accuracy.

**Abstract:** Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating "confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases, enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

**TL;DR:** AgentSeer is an evaluative framework addressing gaps in assessing risks of large language models transitioning to agentic systems, showcasing distinct vulnerabilities at the agentic level.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To fill critical gaps in current safety evaluation frameworks for agentic systems, particularly in assessing deployment-specific risks.

**Method:** AgentSeer decomposes agentic executions into action and component graphs to provide systematic evaluations. It conducts cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench attacks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AgentSeer framework for agentic systems evaluation
	2. Identification of agentic-only vulnerabilities
	3. Establishment of universal agentic patterns and context-dependent attack effectiveness

**Result:** The framework demonstrates significant differences in vulnerability profiles between model-level and agentic-level assessments, revealing agentic-only vulnerabilities that traditional methods overlook.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AgentSeer highlights the necessity for new evaluation paradigms to address agent-specific risks, supported by the findings from empirical validation.

**Abstract:** As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs, enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash (50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models. Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash: 28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

**Keywords:** Discriminative Lexicon Model, Finnish language, inflectional classes, language learning, morphological systems

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the Discriminative Lexicon Model's ability to comprehend and produce Finnish inflected nouns without relying on inflectional classes by analyzing a dataset of 55,271 nouns.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether inflectional classes are necessary for language learning and to evaluate the learnability of Finnish inflected nouns using a computational model.

**Method:** The study employed various Discriminative Lexicon Model setups, including models informed and not informed by token frequencies while training on a dataset of high-frequency Finnish nouns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the Discriminative Lexicon Model's capability to handle Finnish inflected nouns without inflectional classes.
	2. Highlights the impact of frequency in language input on model accuracy and production.
	3. Challenging the necessity of inflectional classes can inform both linguistic theory and computational approaches.

**Result:** On training data, models showed high accuracy; however, performance decreased on held-out test data, especially for unproductive and less productive classes, while productivity and frequency informed better performance in usage-based models.

**Limitations:** The model struggles with novel forms and has limited correlation with productivity measures, indicating caveats in generalizability.

**Conclusion:** Frequency of use was the main predictor of model performance, and the reliance on productivity measures was limited, challenging the cognitive reality of inflectional classes in language learning.

**Abstract:** Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000 high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity were tenuous or absent.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The AFD framework significantly improves SLU performance and offers a scalable solution for real-world applications by utilizing a lightweight student model.

**Abstract:** Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings (GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient (DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score, and 85.50% overall accuracy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine if LLMs generalize through deep semantic understanding or merely memorization of training data.

**Method:** A bi-perspective evaluation framework was introduced to assess LLMs' scenario cognition using a scenario-based dataset with annotated textual descriptions of fictional facts. The models were evaluated on their ability to answer scenario-related questions and probe their internal representations for associations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel scenario-based dataset for evaluating LLMs
	2. Introduction of a bi-perspective evaluation framework
	3. Findings highlight LLMs' reliance on memorization, challenging assumptions of their semantic capabilities.

**Result:** LLMs show a tendency to rely on superficial memorization rather than demonstrating robust semantic scenario cognition, even in straightforward scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study reveals significant limitations in the semantic understanding of current LLMs, providing insights for further development in this area.

**Abstract:** Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations (internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive insights for advancing their capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method shows potential to enhance the automatic coding of clinical terms to ICD-10, thereby aiding healthcare professionals and improving documentation practices.

**Abstract:** The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes. Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

**Conclusion:** L1RA improves efficiency in LLM fine-tuning and provides diagnostic insights for model refinement, making it a promising approach in resource-constrained scenarios.

**Abstract:** The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1 regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters, thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

**Abstract:** In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** This research aims to enhance long-form generation quality in large language models by addressing limitations in supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning processes.

**Method:** The ACE-RL framework employs adaptive constraint criteria derived from instructions, with a reward mechanism that evaluates long-form responses based on these constraints. This is followed by reinforcement learning to improve generation quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced reward for long-form generation
	2. Demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing methods
	3. Provided open access to the code for further exploration

**Result:** ACE-RL significantly outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, and surpasses GPT-4o by 7.10%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study presents ACE-RL as a more effective training paradigm for generating high-quality long-form content in varied scenarios.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained, adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands. Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints, converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally, we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To utilize triage notes for understanding patient epidemiology and illness severity, despite challenges related to data sensitivity and resource limitations in hospitals.

**Method:** A pre-trained LLM was fine-tuned with a small open-sourced dataset on a GPU, followed by fine-tuning with a specific hospital dataset on a CPU.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a classification pipeline for triage data using LLM
	2. Demonstration of effective fine-tuning on limited hardware
	3. Successful application of NLP techniques in a sensitive healthcare context

**Result:** The methodology enables successful classification of triage data while addressing the constraints of data privacy and hardware availability.

**Limitations:** The pipeline relies on the quality of the labeled datasets and may still need expert input for data labeling.

**Conclusion:** By using curated datasets and existing models, we can efficiently classify triage data, which can enhance healthcare insights without extensive computational resources.

**Abstract:** Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges: Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with limited compute resources.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates small Transformer-based models for multi-label sentiment classification in short texts, focusing on domain-specific pre-training, data augmentation, and changes to the classification head.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the challenges of sentiment classification in short texts, including class imbalance, limited training samples, and subjective sentiment labels.

**Method:** Evaluated the effectiveness of BERT and RoBERTa models with fewer than 1 billion parameters under three conditions: continued domain-specific pre-training, generative data augmentation, and modifications to the classification head.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of small Transformer models for sentiment classification.
	2. Insights on the impact of data augmentation and pre-training on learning.
	3. Recommendations for refining classification strategies in short texts.

**Result:** Data augmentation improves classification performance, while further pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise. Modifications to the classification head only yield marginal improvements.

**Limitations:** The noise introduced by continued pre-training on augmented datasets may affect accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The findings offer practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models for sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments.

**Abstract:** Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings. Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1) continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation, and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text datasets.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that models can bypass explicit intent recognition without degrading the quality of service responses, leading to more streamlined conversational AI designs.

**Abstract:** In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines, offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective response generation systems.

**TL;DR:** Entropy2Vec is a novel framework for creating cross-lingual language embeddings using the entropy of monolingual language models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional typological inventories that are affected by feature sparsity and static snapshots, providing a more dynamic method for capturing language similarities.

**Method:** Entropy2Vec quantifies the structural similarity between languages by assessing the entropy of monolingual language model predictions, leading to dense embeddings that adapt to different contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a framework leveraging entropy for language representation
	2. Development of dense, adaptable embeddings free from missing values
	3. Demonstrated alignment with typological categories and competitive NLP task performance

**Result:** Empirical evaluations show that Entropy2Vec embeddings correspond with established typological categories and perform competitively in various multilingual NLP tasks, including those handled by the LinguAlchemy framework.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach provides a robust alternative to existing methods, offering embeddings that are both comprehensive and adaptable to different languages.

**Abstract:** We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of ToM-SSI, a multimodal benchmark for testing Theory of Mind in complex social interactions.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Theory of Mind capabilities beyond traditional benchmarks that only assess basic interactions.

**Method:** Developed a new benchmark (ToM-SSI) that involves group interactions and spatial dynamics in multimodal settings, allowing assessment of mixed cooperative and obstructive behaviors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced ToM-SSI benchmark for dynamic social interactions.
	2. Demonstrated the inadequacy of existing models in complex Theory of Mind tasks.
	3. Facilitated the study of mixed cooperative and obstructive settings in multi-agent scenarios.

**Result:** Current models show limited performance in these complex tasks, revealing significant gaps in their Theory of Mind understanding.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not encompass all nuances of human social interactions and relies on the design of the test environment.

**Conclusion:** The ToM-SSI benchmark opens avenues for more nuanced research in social cognition and highlights the need for improved models in handling complex interactions.

**Abstract:** Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future research.

**Motivation:** To overcome challenges in end-to-end rewriting approaches due to multiple fuzzy expressions, facilitating better query identification and rewriting.

**Method:** The ICR framework alternates between generating clarification questions and reformulating queries iteratively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ICR framework for Conversational Query Rewriting.
	2. Demonstration of iterative improvement in query understanding and retrieval performance.
	3. Establishment of state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that ICR outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on two major datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The iterative communication between clarification and rewriting leads to improved query understanding and information retrieval.

**Abstract:** Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Practical In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT) by introducing the PRIM dataset and a new model called VisTrans.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current IIMT research relies on synthetic data, which does not adequately represent real-world conditions. This gap necessitates a focus on practical multilingual machine translation using images.

**Method:** The authors annotate a dataset called PRIM, consisting of real-world images with complex backgrounds and diverse text, and propose an end-to-end model, VisTrans, which processes visual information separately from text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the PRIM dataset for real-world IIMT
	2. Development of the VisTrans model for improved translation and visual quality
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness of the model on complex image data.

**Result:** VisTrans outperforms existing models in terms of both translation quality and visual effectiveness across a range of multilingual scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The PRIM dataset and VisTrans model contribute towards bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world IIMT, enabling better applicability in multilingual translation tasks.

**Abstract:** In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world, causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared to other models. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/BITHLP/PRIM.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the trust and accountability issues associated with large language models deployed in high-risk domains due to opacity, bias, and instability.

**Method:** A triadic fusion framework named TAXAL that combines cognitive, functional, and causal dimensions for explainability, supported by synthesis of existing methods and case studies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the TAXAL framework for LLM explainability
	2. Synthesis of existing explanation methods within the TAXAL model
	3. Case studies demonstrating the framework's applicability across various fields.

**Result:** Demonstrated the applicability of TAXAL through case studies in various fields, showing its effectiveness in adapting explanation strategies to different sociotechnical contexts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TAXAL enhances explainability as both a technical and sociotechnical practice, facilitating trustworthy LLM applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs, do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs.   We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing, evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.   Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services, showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and stakeholder roles.   By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways, TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.

**TL;DR:** Hunyuan-MT-7B is a bidirectional multilingual translation model, excelling in 33 languages, particularly Mandarin and minority languages. Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B improves performance with multiple outputs. Both models show state-of-the-art results in translation tasks, especially at WMT2025.

**Read time:** 10 min

**Motivation:** To enhance multilingual translation, especially for underrepresented languages and dialects, and to improve model performance in diverse translation scenarios.

**Method:** The models follow a holistic training process: starting with general and MT-oriented pre-training, proceeding to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for specific tasks, and culminating in advanced alignment techniques using Reinforcement Learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B for multilingual translation.
	2. Focus on low-resource languages and dialects.
	3. State-of-the-art results in multilingual translation tasks.

**Result:** Both models significantly outperform other translation-specific models and several leading large models, achieving first place in 30 out of 31 language pairs at WMT2025.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Hunyuan-MT-7B and Chimera-7B demonstrate superior translation capabilities across a wide range of languages, highlighting their applicability in multilingual settings.

**Abstract:** In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across 33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects. Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31 language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluations and independent comparisons among foundation models used for time series analysis.

**Method:** The authors formalize three specific tasks to assess model capabilities: recognition, differentiation, and generation. They unify four recent datasets to facilitate direct comparisons among 13 state-of-the-art models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Formulation of three distinct evaluation tasks for time series analysis
	2. Unification of multiple datasets for comparative model evaluation
	3. Demonstration of performance differences among language-only, vision-language, and multimodal models

**Result:** The evaluation reveals that popular language-only models underperform, while vision-language models are successful; pretrained multimodal time series-language models outperform LLMs, though improvements are needed.

**Limitations:** Models exhibit fragility in robustness tests, indicating areas for further research and improvement.

**Conclusion:** The proposed benchmark offers a systematic evaluation framework for time series reasoning systems, highlighting the need for specialized architectures and better robustness in models.

**Abstract:** Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which improves long-distance dependency modeling in Transformers.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing positional encoding methods like RoPE have limitations in modeling long-range dependencies due to oscillatory attention patterns and fixed representations.

**Method:** The paper proposes a geometric reformulation using hyperbolic functions and Lorentz transformations to create HoPE.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE) for improved long-distance modeling
	2. Generalized formulation that encompasses existing methods like RoPE
	3. Demonstration of consistent performance improvements over standard benchmarks.

**Result:** Experimental results show that HoPE consistently outperforms existing positional encoding methods in repeated sequence benchmarks and supports stable attention weight decay.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HoPE offers a better framework for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies in Transformer models compared to its predecessors.

**Abstract:** Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a framework for difficulty-aware reasoning in models, enabling them to adapt their reasoning depth according to problem complexity without changing their architecture.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing chain-of-thought reasoning can lead to verbose outputs for simpler problems, necessitating a more adaptable reasoning approach.

**Method:** The authors propose a post-training method that uses curated data to include reasoning traces proportional to problem difficulty, combining supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced difficulty-aware reasoning framework for models.
	2. Demonstrated that post-training can achieve dynamic inference without architectural changes.
	3. Combined supervised fine-tuning with direct preference optimization to improve reasoning efficiency.

**Result:** Through their approach, models learn to adjust reasoning depth dynamically, resulting in less verbose answers for simple problems while enhancing performance on complex ones.

**Limitations:** Further exploration is needed to generalize findings across diverse problem types and to optimize for even more nuanced reasoning adaptations.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that effective post-training enables models to provide appropriate reasoning depth based on the complexity of problems, thus improving both efficiency and accuracy.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO) preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp, while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

### [103] [Uniform Information Density and Syntactic Reduction: Revisiting $\textit{that}$-Mentioning in English Complement Clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05254)

*Hailin Hao, Elsi Kaiser*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Uniform Information Density, complementizer, information density, machine learning, contextual word embeddings

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates how speakers manage information transmission during language production, specifically focusing on the use of the complementizer 'that'.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how variability in language expression can be linked to the Uniform Information Density hypothesis, particularly in terms of the omission of the complementizer 'that'.

**Method:** Analysis of a contemporary conversational corpus utilizing machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information density.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced machine learning techniques to analyze language production.
	2. Demonstrated the superiority of contextual word embeddings over traditional measures.
	3. Replicated and expanded upon the UID hypothesis regarding the use of 'that' in language.

**Result:** Confirmed the link between information density and the usage of 'that', revealing that contextual word embeddings provide better insights than previous measures based solely on subcategorization probability.

**Limitations:** Focuses only on conversational English and may not generalize to other languages or dialects.

**Conclusion:** Contextual word embeddings enhance understanding of complementizer usage and its relationship with information density, indicating substantial lexical variation in previous measures.

**Abstract:** Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction, we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information density. Our results replicated the established relationship between information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs' subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate and improve the performance of linear complexity sequence models by examining their decay mechanisms.

**Method:** The authors delineate the design space of decay mechanisms and conduct experiments on various language modeling tasks to evaluate performance outcomes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic investigation of decay mechanisms in linear sequence models
	2. Identification of crucial parameterization strategies
	3. Critical evaluation of parameter sharing effects on performance

**Result:** The study finds specific configurations for decay parameterization are crucial, highlights issues with arbitrary parameter sharing, and compares the performance of scalar versus vector-based decay strategies, revealing unexpected results in certain contexts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Effective decay mechanisms require careful parameterization. Vector decay generally outperforms scalar decay, but specific parameter setups can lead to scalar decay performing surprisingly well, especially with respect to positional encoding methods.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions: parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies, scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart. However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies, scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear attention mechanisms.

**Motivation:** To understand when and how linguistic abilities develop in LLMs, as traditional evaluation methods do not adequately capture this process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of sparse crosscoders for feature analysis across model checkpoints.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method is architecture-agnostic and scalable, contributing to a more interpretable analysis of representation learning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout pretraining.

**Motivation:** To address the lack of multilingual PLMs tailored for cross-lingual retrieval, leveraging the universal alignment of sentences in parallel documents.

**Method:** Introduces a masked sentence model (MSM) with a sentence encoder and a shared document encoder for all languages, using a masked sentence prediction task combined with hierarchical contrastive loss for training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a tailored multilingual PLM for cross-lingual retrieval.
	2. Development of a masked sentence prediction task for training.
	3. Demonstration of superior retrieval performance compared to existing models.

**Result:** MSM achieves significant improvements over existing pre-training models in cross-lingual retrieval across four tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed MSM model demonstrates stronger retrieval capabilities and is more effective than current state-of-the-art multilingual PLMs.

**Abstract:** Recently multi-lingual pre-trained language models (PLM) such as mBERT and XLM-R have achieved impressive strides in cross-lingual dense retrieval. Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study provides a foundational framework for advancing prompt engineering techniques, showing relationships between prompting, LLMs, and knowledge bases.

**Abstract:** The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.

AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model.

**TL;DR:** SePO is a selective alignment strategy for optimizing large language models through efficient token selection, outperforming existing methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient and less noisy token-level preference optimization in large language model alignment.

**Method:** SePO utilizes Direct Preference Optimization to train a model that selects key tokens for a target policy model, minimizing training cost through efficient token selection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Selective Preference Optimization (SePO) for token selection.
	2. Use of Direct Preference Optimization for training token selection models.
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness of weak oracle models in supervising larger policy models.

**Result:** Demonstrated significant improvements in performance by optimizing only 30% of the key tokens across multiple benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SePO facilitates better training efficiency and mitigates over-optimization, particularly in environments with limited data.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language model alignment leverage token-level supervisions to perform fine-grained preference optimization. However, existing token-level alignment methods either optimize on all available tokens, which can be noisy and inefficient, or perform selective training with complex and expensive key token selection strategies. In this work, we propose Selective Preference Optimization (SePO), a novel selective alignment strategy that centers on efficient key token selection. SePO proposes the first token selection method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains an oracle model to estimate a token-level reward function on the target data. This method applies to any existing alignment datasets with response-level annotations and enables cost-efficient token selection with small-scale oracle models and training data. The estimated reward function is then utilized to score all tokens within the target dataset, where only the key tokens are selected to supervise the target policy model with a reference model-free contrastive objective function. Extensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks show that SePO significantly outperforms competitive baseline methods by only optimizing 30% key tokens on the target dataset. SePO applications on weak-to-strong generalization show that weak oracle models effectively supervise strong policy models with up to 16.8x more parameters. SePO also effectively selects key tokens from out-of-distribution data to enhance strong policy models and alleviate the over-optimization problem.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The correctness of FOL statements in logical reasoning problems using LLMs is often unverified due to unreliable evaluation metrics, highlighting a need for better measurement tools.

**Method:** The study assesses the sensitivity of existing NL, FOL, and graph-based metrics by applying perturbations to FOL statements and evaluating their alignment with judgments made by a strong LLM.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. In-depth analysis of the sensitivity of various metrics for evaluating FOL statements.
	2. Demonstration of the oversensitivity of the BLEU metric for text perturbations.
	3. Introduction of the improvement in evaluation robustness through the combination of multiple metrics.

**Result:** The findings reveal that the n-gram metric BLEU is oversensitive to text perturbations, while BertScore aligns more closely with LLM judgments. Combining multiple metrics shows improved robustness and sensitivity.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on certain metrics and may not cover all potential evaluation tools available for FOL statements.

**Conclusion:** The paper emphasizes the need for improved semantic evaluation metrics in the context of LLMs and suggests that a combination of metrics may provide a better evaluation framework.

**Abstract:** The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language (NL) statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text, often go unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based metrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding ground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of FOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator and text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric sensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics against LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation affects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL metric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between BertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs in clinical summarization
	2. Insights into the effectiveness of multi-modal data integration
	3. Identification of limitations in temporal reasoning and rare disease prediction

**Result:** Long context windows enhance the integration of input data, but do not universally improve clinical reasoning; LLMs struggle with temporal coherence and rare disease predictions.

**Limitations:** LLMs still face challenges in maintaining temporal coherence and accurately predicting rare diseases despite improvements with long context and RAG.

**Conclusion:** This work provides a foundation for assessing LLMs in the context of long clinical text summarization, addressing both successes and limitations in multi-modal and temporal reasoning.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in clinical text summarization, but their ability to handle long patient trajectories with multi-modal data spread across time remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) variants and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on long-context clinical summarization and prediction. We examine their ability to synthesize structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data while reasoning over temporal coherence, by re-engineering existing tasks, including discharge summarization and diagnosis prediction from two publicly available EHR datasets. Our results indicate that long context windows improve input integration but do not consistently enhance clinical reasoning, and LLMs are still struggling with temporal progression and rare disease prediction. While RAG shows improvements in hallucination in some cases, it does not fully address these limitations. Our work fills the gap in long clinical text summarization, establishing a foundation for evaluating LLMs with multi-modal data and temporal reasoning.

**Conclusion:** StereoDetect is an effective tool for improving stereotype detection in AI, addressing key gaps in the existing research landscape.

**Abstract:** Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, simulation, counterfactual instruction following, benchmark dataset, educational personas

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate LLMs' ability to simulate personas with reversed performance, revealing their limitations in counterfactual instruction following.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to enhance the ability of Large Language Models to simulate diverse personas, particularly those that exhibit reversed performance in educational settings, which current models struggle to do.

**Method:** The authors propose a benchmark dataset specifically designed to assess LLMs on their capability to follow counterfactual instructions and simulate personas with reversed performance, focusing on mathematical reasoning as a key example.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a benchmark dataset for evaluating counterfactual instruction following in LLMs.
	2. Analysis of LLM performance in simulating reversed personas in educational contexts.
	3. Discussion of the intersectional challenges faced by LLMs when simulating personas.

**Result:** The evaluation reveals that both open-weight and closed-source LLMs struggle significantly with following counterfactual instructions, particularly when simulating reversed performance personas, and the intersection of performance level and race further complicates the simulation.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to evaluating LLMs in the context of mathematical reasoning and may not encompass all areas of counterfactual instruction following.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in effectively simulating a diverse range of personas and highlight the necessity for additional research in counterfactual instruction following.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.

**Result:** Strong performance in claim detection with macro F1 scores up to 0.896 in cross-validation, but challenges in generalization for unseen topics.

**Limitations:** The dataset may struggle with generalization to distinct unseen topics due to its focus on specific domains.

**Conclusion:** ViClaim serves as a significant resource for improving misinformation detection in video settings, indicating the intricate challenges within multimodal analysis.

**Abstract:** The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** overhearing agents, Dungeons & Dragons, audio-language models, assistive technology, human evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a new interaction paradigm involving LLM agents known as "overhearing agents," which assist users by passively listening to human conversations, showcased through a study in Dungeons & Dragons gameplay.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore alternative methods for LLM interaction that do not require direct user engagement, offering a new dimension to assistive technology.

**Method:** An in-depth study utilizing large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents during Dungeons & Dragons gameplay, including a human evaluation to measure effectiveness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the overhearing agents paradigm
	2. Demonstration through Dungeons & Dragons gameplay
	3. Release of tools and code for further research

**Result:** The evaluation indicated that some large audio-language models could successfully perform overhearing tasks by interpreting implicit audio cues, demonstrating emergent capabilities.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a specific application (Dungeons & Dragons) and may require further validation in broader contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings support the potential of overhearing agents in providing subtle assistance while users engage in conversation and offer resources for further research.

**Abstract:** Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.
