### [1] [Investigating the Impact and Student Perceptions of Guided Parsons Problems for Learning Logic with Subgoals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04712)

*Sutapa Dey Tithi, Xiaoyi Tian, Min Chi, Tiffany Barnes*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Guided Parsons Problems, learning outcomes, problem solving, intelligent tutoring systems, task decomposition

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The study introduces Guided Parsons Problems (GPPs) that provide step-specific hints to improve learning outcomes in logic problem solving, demonstrating increased accuracy and efficiency among students, especially those with lower prior knowledge.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this study is to address the difficulties students face when learning with traditional Parsons Problems (PPs) and to enhance problem-solving efficiency and learning outcomes.

**Method:** This research involved a controlled experiment with 76 participants where GPPs were utilized, comparing their performance in level-end tests and post-tests against traditional PPs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Guided Parsons Problems (GPPs)
	2. Demonstration of significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency in problem solving
	3. Thematic analysis revealing key aspects of student experiences with GPPs

**Result:** Students who learned with GPPs demonstrated significantly higher accuracy in rule application and improved problem-solving efficiency, particularly benefiting students with lower prior knowledge, despite initially spending more time in training.

**Limitations:** Some students felt that the structured nature of GPPs limited their reasoning processes, suggesting a need for more individualized approaches.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that GPPs effectively integrate the advantages of worked examples and problem-solving practice but highlight the potential for individual adaptation to enhance their effectiveness further.

**Abstract:** Parsons problems (PPs) have shown promise in structured problem solving by providing scaffolding that decomposes the problem and requires learners to reconstruct the solution. However, some students face difficulties when first learning with PPs or solving more complex Parsons problems. This study introduces Guided Parsons problems (GPPs) designed to provide step-specific hints and improve learning outcomes in an intelligent logic tutor. In a controlled experiment with 76 participants, GPP students achieved significantly higher accuracy of rule application in both level-end tests and post-tests, with the strongest gains among students with lower prior knowledge. GPP students initially spent more time in training (1.52 vs. 0.81 hours) but required less time for post-tests, indicating improved problem solving efficiency. Our thematic analysis of GPP student self-explanations revealed task decomposition, better rule understanding, and reduced difficulty as key themes, while some students felt the structured nature of GPPs restricted their own way of reasoning. These findings reinforce that GPPs can effectively combine the benefits of worked examples and problem solving practice, but could be further improved by individual adaptation.

### [2] [From First Draft to Final Insight: A Multi-Agent Approach for Feedback Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04869)

*Jie Cao, Chloe Qianhui Zhao, Xian Chen, Shuman Wang, Christian Schunn, Kenneth R. Koedinger, Jionghao Lin*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** large language models, multi-agent systems, feedback quality, education technology, automated feedback

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a multi-agent approach for enhancing feedback quality through a process called "generation, evaluation, and regeneration" (G-E-RG), utilizing Large Language Models. It reports significant improvements in feedback dimensions and accuracy over traditional methods.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges in providing high-quality feedback efficiently, the study explores the potential of automation technologies, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Method:** The proposed G-E-RG approach integrates six methods combining three feedback theoretical frameworks with two prompting techniques: zero-shot generation and retrieval-augmented generation with chain-of-thought (RAG_CoT).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-agent approach for feedback enhancement using LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of substantial improvements in feedback quality and accuracy.
	3. Exploration of combining feedback frameworks with advanced prompting methods.

**Result:** The G-E-RG approach achieved a 3.36% to 12.98% improvement in evaluation accuracy and increased the effective feedback components from an average of 27.72% to 98.49%.

**Limitations:** Certain sub-dimensions of feedback quality, such as strengthening the teacher-student relationship, need further enhancement.

**Conclusion:** While G-E-RG significantly enhanced feedback quality, some sub-dimensions require further improvement. Overall, the simplicity of feedback also improved.

**Abstract:** Producing large volumes of high-quality, timely feedback poses significant challenges to instructors. To address this issue, automation technologies-particularly Large Language Models (LLMs)-show great potential. However, current LLM-based research still shows room for improvement in terms of feedback quality. Our study proposed a multi-agent approach performing "generation, evaluation, and regeneration" (G-E-RG) to further enhance feedback quality. In the first-generation phase, six methods were adopted, combining three feedback theoretical frameworks and two prompt methods: zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation with chain-of-thought (RAG_CoT). The results indicated that, compared to first-round feedback, G-E-RG significantly improved final feedback across six methods for most dimensions. Specifically:(1) Evaluation accuracy for six methods increased by 3.36% to 12.98% (p<0.001); (2) The proportion of feedback containing four effective components rose from an average of 27.72% to an average of 98.49% among six methods, sub-dimensions of providing critiques, highlighting strengths, encouraging agency, and cultivating dialogue also showed great enhancement (p<0.001); (3) There was a significant improvement in most of the feature values (p<0.001), although some sub-dimensions (e.g., strengthening the teacher-student relationship) still require further enhancement; (4) The simplicity of feedback was effectively enhanced (p<0.001) for three methods.

### [3] [Fairness Perceptions in Regression-based Predictive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04886)

*Mukund Telukunta, Venkata Sriram Siddhardh Nadendla, Morgan Stuart, Casey Canfield*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** predictive analytics, fairness, kidney transplantation, regression, social discrimination

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses biases in regression-based predictive analytics used in kidney transplantation and introduces new fairness evaluation criteria.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle social discrimination and inefficient organ utilization resulting from biases in kidney transplantation predictive analytics.

**Method:** Introduced new divergence-based group fairness notions (independence, separation, sufficiency) and utilized Mixed-Logit discrete choice modeling with feedback from 85 participants to assess fairness preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of three novel fairness concepts for regression analytics
	2. Analysis of crowd-sourced fairness feedback
	3. Identification of social preferences in fairness metrics

**Result:** Participants exhibited strong preferences for separation and sufficiency fairness notions, with predictive analytics being fair for gender and race but unfair for age groups.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for addressing fairness in kidney transplantation predictive analytics to improve social equity and organ utilization.

**Abstract:** Regression-based predictive analytics used in modern kidney transplantation is known to inherit biases from training data. This leads to social discrimination and inefficient organ utilization, particularly in the context of a few social groups. Despite this concern, there is limited research on fairness in regression and its impact on organ utilization and placement. This paper introduces three novel divergence-based group fairness notions: (i) independence, (ii) separation, and (iii) sufficiency to assess the fairness of regression-based analytics tools. In addition, fairness preferences are investigated from crowd feedback, in order to identify a socially accepted group fairness criterion for evaluating these tools. A total of 85 participants were recruited from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform, and a Mixed-Logit discrete choice model was used to model fairness feedback and estimate social fairness preferences. The findings clearly depict a strong preference towards the separation and sufficiency fairness notions, and that the predictive analytics is deemed fair with respect to gender and race groups, but unfair in terms of age groups.

**Method:** User study involving tests and interviews with fourteen actors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Theatrical Language Processing (TLP)
	2. Development of the AI-driven creativity support tool Scribble.ai
	3. Insights on balancing AI input and actor interpretative freedom.

**Result:** Actors showed expanded creativity with AI-generated irregular scenarios and improved problem-solving skills, but faced limitations due to overly detailed scripts.

**Limitations:** AI-generated scripts can sometimes be overly detailed, limiting actor creativity and interpretive freedom.

**Conclusion:** AI tools like Scribble.ai can enhance creative expression in film and theater but must strike a balance between structure and interpretative freedom.

**Abstract:** The increasing convergence of artificial intelligence has opened new avenues, including its emerging role in enhancing creativity. It is reshaping traditional creative practices such as actor improvisation, which often struggles with predictable patterns, limited interaction, and a lack of engaging stimuli. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, Theatrical Language Processing (TLP), and an AI-driven creativity support tool, Scribble.ai, designed to augment actors' creative expression and spontaneity through interactive practice. We conducted a user study involving tests and interviews with fourteen participants. Our findings indicate that: (1) Actors expanded their creativity when faced with AI-produced irregular scenarios; (2) The AI's unpredictability heightened their problem-solving skills, specifically in interpreting unfamiliar situations; (3) However, AI often generated excessively detailed scripts, which limited interpretive freedom and hindered subtext exploration. Based on these findings, we discuss the new potential in enhancing creative expressions in film and theater studies through an AI-driven tool.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the analysis of eye-tracking data by making analysts aware of uncertainties related to gaze mapping to AOIs and depth dependency in 3D scenes.

**Method:** The authors developed uncertainty-aware scarf plot visualizations and compared their effectiveness against standard scarf plots within an augmented reality context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of uncertainty-aware scarf plot visualizations.
	2. Highlighting uncertainties in gaze data mapping to AOIs.
	3. Comparison of new visualizations against standard methods.

**Result:** The proposed visualizations effectively highlight uncertainties in automatic AOI annotation and the mapping of gaze data, leading to better-informed analyses.

**Conclusion:** Uncertainty-aware visualizations provide significant advantages in eye-tracking data analysis, particularly in augmented reality applications.

**Abstract:** Multiple challenges emerge when analyzing eye-tracking data with areas of interest (AOIs) because recordings are subject to different sources of uncertainties. Previous work often presents gaze data without considering those inaccuracies in the data. To address this issue, we developed uncertainty-aware scarf plot visualizations that aim to make analysts aware of uncertainties with respect to the position-based mapping of gaze to AOIs and depth dependency in 3D scenes. Additionally, we also consider uncertainties in automatic AOI annotation. We showcase our approach in comparison to standard scarf plots in an augmented reality scenario.

### [9] [From Perception to Decision: Assessing the Role of Chart Types Affordances in High-Level Decision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04686)

*Yixuan Li, Emery D. Berger, Minsuk Kahng, Cindy Xiong Bearfield*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** visualization, decision-making, academic mentorship, perceptual affordances, chart types

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study examines how different visualization types (bar charts vs. pie charts) influence high-level decision-making in academic mentorship selection.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the effect of visualization design on high-level decision-making as opposed to low-level analytic tasks, which are more commonly studied.

**Method:** A crowdsourced experiment comparing the effectiveness of bar charts and pie charts in helping students evaluate faculty research profiles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of visualization effectiveness in high-level decision-making.
	2. Insights on evaluating visualizations in real-world contexts.
	3. Clarification of the distinction between perceptual and decision affordances.

**Result:** Minimal differences were found in decision outcomes based on the chart type, indicating that findings from controlled environments may not apply to real-world decision-making.

**Limitations:** The study's findings are based on a specific case study and may not generalize to all visualization scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Visualizations should be evaluated in real-world contexts, and it's crucial to differentiate between perceptual affordances and decision affordances.

**Abstract:** Visualization design influences how people perceive data patterns, yet most research focuses on low-level analytic tasks, such as finding correlations. The extent to which these perceptual affordances translate to high-level decision-making in the real world remains underexplored. Through a case study of academic mentorship selection using bar charts and pie charts, we investigated whether chart types differentially influence how students evaluate faculty research profiles. Our crowdsourced experiment revealed only minimal differences in decision outcomes between chart types, suggesting that perceptual affordances established in controlled analytical tasks may not directly translate to high-level decision scenarios. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating visualizations within real-world contexts and highlight the need to distinguish between perceptual and decision affordances when developing visualization guidelines.

### [10] [Negotiative Alignment: Embracing Disagreement to Achieve Fairer Outcomes -- Insights from Urban Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12613)

*Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Berard, Shin Koseki*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** urban assessment, AI, negotiative alignment, marginalized perspectives, community-centered design

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a community-centered study on urban assessment in Montreal, highlighting the importance of diverse perspectives in evaluating urban spaces, and proposes an AI framework called 'negotiative alignment' that incorporates stakeholder disagreements to improve fairness in urban design decisions.

**Read time:** 16 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Conventional urban assessment methods often overlook the perspectives of marginalized groups, risking unfair outcomes in urban design.

**Method:** A community-centered study involving 35 residents, including wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals, used rating and ranking tasks across 20 urban sites to analyze differing opinions on inclusivity and safety.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the negotiative alignment AI framework
	2. Empirical findings that highlight systematic disagreements in urban assessments
	3. Suggestions for integrating the framework into urban analytics for better decision-making

**Result:** The study found systematic disagreements among residents that reflect structural inequalities and differing cultural values, leading to the proposal of the negotiative alignment framework which aims to integrate these disagreements into urban analytics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework can enhance fairness and accountability in urban design by retaining minority viewpoints and adapting to changing stakeholder concerns, advocating for engagement with disagreement rather than seeking consensus.

**Abstract:** Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.   Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how LLMs can assist instructors in enhancing the design of instructional activities, specifically programming exercises, thus improving programming education.

**Method:** A participatory design approach was used to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support and allows instructors to specify common student mistakes for adaptive feedback generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an instructor-authoring tool integrating LLM support for programming problem creation.
	2. Analysis of instructor perceptions regarding LLMs in instructional design.
	3. Assessment of the impact of structured LLM prompting guidelines on activity design efficiency and quality.

**Result:** Case studies with three instructors revealed insights into their perceptions of the utility and limitations of LLMs, showcasing improved efficiency and quality in problem design when using structured LLM prompting guidelines.

**Limitations:** Limited to initial case studies with three instructors; broader applicability and long-term effects of LLM integration remain to be explored.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that LLMs can significantly enhance instructor workflows and programming education, providing useful guidelines for AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.

**Abstract:** Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer significant opportunities to enhance instructional support in introductory programming courses. While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.

### [12] [How Social is It? A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628)

*Yusen Wu, Junwu Xiong, Xiaotie Deng*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Social Interaction, Benchmarking, Multi-user Tasks, Chain of Thought

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a benchmark (HSII) and framework for evaluating social capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in multi-user, multi-turn tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To systematically measure the social capabilities of LLMs for tasks beyond individual communication, addressing a significant gap in current benchmarks.

**Method:** An agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles was developed alongside a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (HSII), which includes tasks like format parsing, target selection, and stable conversation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the HSII framework for measuring LLMs' social capabilities
	2. Creation of the HSII-Dataset derived from news data
	3. Development of the COT-complexity metric for evaluating efficiency in LLM performance

**Result:** Experiments show that HSII effectively evaluates LLMs' social skills across multi-user interactions, revealing the impact of the chain of thought method and introducing COT-complexity to assess efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The HSII benchmark is well-suited for assessing the social skills of LLMs, allowing for refined measurement of their performance in complex social scenarios.

**Abstract:** Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life, instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address disparities between human cognitive processes and computational multimodal information integration in MLLMs.

**Method:** Empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with model behaviors in visual-linguistic tasks, proposing a dynamic cross-modal tokenization framework based on cognitive science.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. New dynamic cross-modal tokenization framework
	2. Improvements on benchmark tasks
	3. Alignment with human cognitive processes

**Result:** Statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene Description) and more human-aligned error patterns and attention distributions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework enhances the cognitive plausibility of AI systems and improves the theoretical understanding of AI and human cognition interactions.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Effective cross-cultural communication requires translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context, which is currently underexplored.

**Method:** The problem is reformulated as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features, utilizing diffusion models for high-fidelity generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Unified approach for S2ST and accent adaptation
	2. Utilization of diffusion models for speech generation
	3. Joint optimization framework for better efficiency

**Result:** The integrated framework allows for joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, resulting in a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in both translation and accent adaptation, enhancing the feasibility of S2ST in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

**Abstract:** Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to investigate the feasibility and reliability of large language models (LLMs) for grading short answer questions (SAQs) in postgraduate medical education, where standardized testing is common.

**Method:** The authors analyzed ChatGPT's grading of 557 short-answer responses from 215 medical students using a structured grading prompt and rubric, employing mixed-effects modeling and various statistical analyses to assess grading accuracy and agreement with human graders.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLMs for grading in medical education
	2. Statistical analysis of grading reliability and agreement
	3. Evidence of poorer performance by LLMs compared to human graders

**Result:** ChatGPT systematically awarded lower marks compared to human graders, with an average bias of -1.34 marks on a 10-point scale and poor individual-level agreement indicated by low ICC and Cohen's kappa values.

**Limitations:** The study was conducted in a single postgraduate medical course and may not generalize to other contexts or subjects.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that LLMs like ChatGPT are not reliable for grading postgraduate coursework accurately, as a majority of the assigned grades significantly diverged from those given by human evaluators, highlighting their limitations in high-stakes assessments.

**Abstract:** Standardised tests using short answer questions (SAQs) are common in postgraduate education. Large language models (LLMs) simulate conversational language and interpret unstructured free-text responses in ways aligning with applying SAQ grading rubrics, making them attractive for automated grading. We evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale. ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value = 0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader. The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable boundaries for high-stakes assessments.

**TL;DR:** Advancement of an AI system for multimodal diagnostic consultations shows superiority over primary care physicians in various axes but requires further research for real-world application.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate LLMs' ability to conduct diagnostic conversations using multimodal data in remote medical care settings, addressing the limitations of previous evaluations focused solely on text.

**Method:** The study advances the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) system, integrating multimodal data interpretation and a state-aware dialogue framework that adapts based on patient states during consultations. Comparisons were made with primary care physicians using a randomized, controlled study.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a multimodal diagnostic AI system (AMIE)
	2. Implementation of a state-aware dialogue framework
	3. Comparative study revealing AMIE's superior performance against primary care physicians

**Result:** AMIE outperformed primary care physicians in 7 out of 9 multimodal evaluation metrics and 29 out of 32 non-multimodal metrics, demonstrating enhanced capabilities in diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, and communication.

**Limitations:** Further research needed for real-world translation of findings.

**Conclusion:** While the findings indicate significant progress in multimodal conversational AI for diagnostics, translating these results into real-world applications necessitates additional research.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9 multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but real-world translation needs further research.

In this work, we automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that impact at-risk patients.

**Limitations:** The instability of LLM-generated data in high-frequency settings and dependency on sensor placement.

**Conclusion:** These findings highlight the importance of dataset characteristics and generation methods for effective fall detection modeling using synthetic data.

**Abstract:** Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g., 20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data generation for fall detection models.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of combining personalized advertising recommendations with user privacy protection and data security in actual operations.

**Method:** The paper outlines the LLM principles and constructs an algorithmic model using BERT for personalized advertising recommendations, incorporating data preprocessing, feature selection, semantic embedding, local model training, and data encryption.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a BERT-based algorithmic model for personalized advertising

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that BERT-based advertising recommendations significantly increase click-through and conversion rates while also reducing the risk of user privacy leakage through security measures.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that it is feasible to improve advertising effectiveness with LLMs while maintaining privacy and security protocols.

**Abstract:** Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this study is to overcome the challenges associated with manually querying extensive and complex building codes, by leveraging a QA system to improve access to relevant information.

**Method:** The methodology involves evaluating various retriever methods for the QA system, focusing on optimizing a language model's generational capability through domain-specific fine-tuning techniques using data from the NBCC.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a QA system for building codes using RAG
	2. Identification of Elasticsearch as a robust retriever for the NBCC
	3. Demonstration of improved LLM performance through domain-specific fine-tuning

**Result:** The experiments revealed that Elasticsearch is the most effective retriever for building codes, and that fine-tuning language models on the NBCC dataset significantly improves their contextual response generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Overall, the integration of a powerful retriever like Elasticsearch with fine-tuned language models leads to enhanced performance in navigating the complexities of building codes, thereby improving user access to vital information.

**Abstract:** Building codes are regulations that establish standards for the design, construction, and safety of buildings to ensure structural integrity, fire protection, and accessibility. They are often extensive, complex, and subject to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses. When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system, enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.

**TL;DR:** Reward-SQL is a framework that incorporates Process Reward Models (PRMs) into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process to improve SQL generation accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance accuracy in SQL generation by effectively using Reward Models during reasoning.

**Method:** A two-step approach that first decomposes SQL queries into stepwise reasoning chains, followed by integrating PRMs into the reasoning process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Reward-SQL framework for Text-to-SQL tasks.
	2. Employed a two-step reasoning process combining SQL decomposition and PRM integration.
	3. Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on the BIRD benchmark with PRM-guided models.

**Result:** Reward-SQL demonstrates a 13.1% performance improvement on the BIRD benchmark with models using PRMs for guidance during training and inference.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Reward-SQL framework effectively leverages reward-based supervision, yielding superior accuracy in Text-to-SQL tasks.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision" paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly available.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of the REVEAL Framework for evaluating safety in Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:**  VLLMs integrate image and text processing but face significant safety and ethical challenges not addressed by traditional evaluation methods.

**Method:** The REVEAL Framework automates image mining, generates synthetic adversarial data, expands multi-turn conversations, and assesses harm with evaluators like GPT-4o.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the REVEAL Framework for VLLM evaluation.
	2. Evaluation of multiple VLLMs leading to significant insights into their vulnerabilities.
	3. Identification of misinformation as a crucial area for enhancement.

**Result:** Evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, revealing higher defect rates in multi-turn interactions, with GPT-4o performing best across metrics.

**Limitations:** Framework primarily focused on harm assessment; additional studies needed for broader implications.

**Conclusion:** Misinformation is critical in VLLMs; existing models need improved defenses and evaluation methods.

**Abstract:** Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o.   We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of domain-specific large language models for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises, overcoming limitations in current methodologies.

**Method:** The framework involves continual pre-training to integrate domain knowledge, domain-progressive supervised fine-tuning with a curriculum learning strategy, and distillation-enhanced speculative decoding to improve inference speed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of SOAEsV2-7B/72B series of LLMs
	2. Implementation of a three-phase framework for domain-specific model enhancement
	3. Empirical evidence of performance improvements in domain-specific tasks

**Result:** The proposed method demonstrates a significant speedup in inference without loss of quality, while maintaining high general language capabilities and improving domain-specific performance on evaluation metrics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study successfully outlines a comprehensive approach for refining LLMs in specific domains, showcasing substantial performance gains while retaining foundational language skills.

**Abstract:** This study addresses key challenges in developing domain-specific large language models (LLMs) for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises (SOAEs), where current approaches face three limitations: 1) constrained model capacity that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work, we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3) distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving 1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a 1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving 1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs, bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific expertise.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the systematic correlation between emotional expression in poetry and visual cultural representation during the Tang and Song dynasties.

**Method:** Employing BERT-based sentiment analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery in Tang Song poetry and validating these patterns against developments in decorative arts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Application of BERT-based sentiment analysis in a new cultural context.
	2. Cross-referencing literary content with visual evidence to provide comprehensive insights.
	3. The identification of emotional shifts in floral motifs across two significant Chinese dynasties.

**Result:** Detects measurable shifts in emotional connotations associated with floral imagery, specifically peony and plum blossom, between the Tang and Song periods, confirmed by cross-referencing with material culture evidence.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the selection of poetry and visual evidence examined, and potential biases in the sentiment analysis models used.

**Conclusion:** The study reveals previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic representation in historical contexts.

**Abstract:** The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic representation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of hallucinations in RAG systems that hinder their deployment in production by providing a scalable and efficient detection method.

**Method:** The authors present a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset that includes induced hallucinations and demonstrate improvements in hallucination detection through supervised fine-tuning on this dataset with a 7B model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset for hallucination detection.
	2. Improved recall metrics compared to existing models like GPT-4o.
	3. Demonstration of competitive performance with fewer parameters.

**Result:** The proposed method achieves better recall than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth benchmark while maintaining competitive precision and accuracy with significantly fewer parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of the new dataset and method offers an effective solution for hallucination detection in RAG systems, essential for their real-world application.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained widespread adoption by application builders because they leverage sources of truth to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate more factually sound responses. However, hallucinations, instances of LLM responses that are unfaithful to the provided context, often prevent these systems from being deployed in production environments. Current hallucination detection methods typically involve human evaluation or the use of closed-source models to review RAG system outputs for hallucinations. Both human evaluators and closed-source models suffer from scaling issues due to their high costs and slow inference speeds. In this work, we introduce a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset with induced hallucinations. Via supervised fine-tuning on our dataset, we achieve better recall with a 7B model than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth hallucination detection benchmark and offer competitive performance on precision and accuracy, all while using a fraction of the parameters. Code is released at our repository.

**Motivation:** Hallucinations in LLMs are a significant problem, even when using context to reduce unsupported information and contradictions.

**Method:** The paper introduces FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach that utilizes few-shot human annotations to enhance LLM hallucination evaluation. It also discusses a comparative analysis of existing hallucination detection methods and the challenges they face.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FaithJudge for improved hallucination evaluation
	2. Analysis of challenges in current hallucination detection methods
	3. Development of an enhanced hallucination leaderboard for better benchmarking

**Result:** FaithJudge significantly improves the automated evaluation of hallucinations in LLMs compared to existing methods, leading to better benchmarking through an enhanced hallucination leaderboard.

**Limitations:** Existing hallucination detection methods still face several challenges that are highlighted in the analysis.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach provides a more reliable means of assessing LLM hallucinations, ultimately advancing the state of evaluation in RAG contexts.

**Abstract:** Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of current semantic retrieval systems for academic content by providing optimized models for educational contexts.

**Method:** Two models were evaluated: one using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL) and another that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss. A synthetic dataset of 3,197 sentence pairs was used for training and evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of two fine-tuned embedding models for educational question answering.
	2. Demonstration of a replicable framework for improving semantic retrieval in academic contexts.
	3. Creation of a synthetic dataset specifically designed for this purpose.

**Result:** Both models significantly outperformed established open-source models and approached the performance of proprietary embeddings, particularly the dual-loss model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research contributes to enhancing semantic retrieval in education with reusable models and a framework applicable in various academic settings such as chatbots and RAG systems.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable, domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning management system (LMS) integrations.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper examines the role of chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens in large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks, revealing that intermediate results can be stored more efficiently while maintaining performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand the inner mechanisms of chain-of-thought (CoT) in LLMs when solving complex reasoning tasks.

**Method:** Empirical study on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming, analyzing the function of CoT tokens and their replacements with latent forms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical evidence that CoT tokens can be replaced by intermediate results without performance loss.
	2. Insights into the behavior of CoT tokens serving as variables akin to programming languages.
	3. Identification of the implications of unintended shortcuts and computational limits of CoT tokens.

**Result:** The study finds that only preserving intermediate result tokens achieves similar performance as full CoT, and that CoT tokens behave like program variables but can introduce complexities and shortcuts.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to two specific tasks and may not generalize to all reasoning scenarios involving LLMs.

**Conclusion:** CoT tokens are confirmed to function similarly to variables in programs, potentially leading to computational limitations and unintended shortcuts during problem-solving.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

**Motivation:** To empirically test the argument linking power-law properties with hierarchical structures in language, especially in relation to syntax, semantics, and discourse.

**Method:** The study analyzes the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other statistical properties in parse trees using English corpora.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical testing of the power-law argument in linguistic structures
	2. Analysis of parse trees related to power-law decay
	3. Insights into limitations of hierarchical structure assumptions in child languages and animal signals

**Result:** The results demonstrate that the assumptions linking statistical properties of parse trees with hierarchical structure do not hold, complicating the application of this argument to child languages and animal signals.

**Limitations:** Findings may not generalize to all languages or linguistic features.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a need to rethink the relationship between power laws and hierarchical structures in linguistic analysis.

**Abstract:** Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical structures.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of Latent Preference Coding (LPC), a framework for aligning large language models with human preferences by modeling implicit factors of preferences using discrete latent codes.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to align LLM generations with human preferences in a way that effectively captures the complex and conflicting nature of those preferences.

**Method:** LPC models implicit and combined factors of holistic preferences using discrete latent codes and integrates with offline alignment algorithms to infer factors without predefined reward functions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LPC framework for holistic preference modeling
	2. Automatic inference of preference factors without predefined functions
	3. Significant improvements in alignment performance across various models

**Result:** LPC demonstrates consistent improvements over three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, IPO) and enhances robustness against noise in data across multiple benchmarks with various base models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LPC provides a unified representation of preference factors, paving the way for more robust alignment techniques in LLM deployment.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet aligning their generations with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding (LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.

**Motivation:** To overcome the sensitivity of In-Context Learning in large language models to the ordering of context examples while maintaining performance.

**Method:** Analyzed the existing invariant ICL algorithms to identify key design elements leading to the proposal of InvICL, which achieves the desired invariance and properties.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of InvICL for invariant ICL

**Result:** InvICL outperforms previous models on benchmark datasets, demonstrating better generalization across different input lengths.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed InvICL methodology enhances the effectiveness of ICL in large language models by addressing key design considerations and surpassing previous methods.

**Abstract:** In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets, showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

**Result:** Performance declines with more than 100 ratings, but smaller LLMs show capability in generating group recommendations under optimal conditions.

**Limitations:** The findings are based on specific LLMs and may not generalize to all models; further research needed.

**Conclusion:** Future GRS evaluations should consider group complexity, as it significantly affects LLM performance, and different formatting of group scenarios can influence accuracy.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.

**Motivation:** Understanding how fine-tuned LLMs make predictions based on their pre-training data can provide insights into their functioning, particularly in the context of downstream tasks.

**Method:** The authors propose a multi-stage influence function that utilizes Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for effective and scalable computation of influence on million-scale LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method offers improved interpretability of LLMs, making it a valuable tool for understanding their decision-making process based on pre-training data.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data. However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack scalability to billion-scale LLMs.   In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation. Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case studies on a real-world LLM, dolly-v2-3b, demonstrate its interpretive power, with exemplars illustrating insights provided by multi-stage influence estimates.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve upon traditional A/B testing methods in evaluating UI design effectiveness by focusing on comparative persuasiveness.

**Method:** The study presents WiserUI-Bench, which consists of 300 pairs of real-world UI images evaluated based on A/B test results and expert rationales. G-FOCUS is proposed as a reasoning strategy to enhance VLM-based assessments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of WiserUI-Bench for UI design persuasiveness assessment
	2. Development of G-FOCUS for improved VLM evaluation accuracy
	3. Provision of a publicly available dataset and code for further research

**Result:** G-FOCUS demonstrates superior consistency and accuracy when compared to existing inference strategies in evaluating pairwise UI designs.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness in real-world applications outside the benchmark is yet to be tested thoroughly.

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods provide a scalable alternative to traditional A/B testing for UI design optimization, fostering the use of VLMs in this domain.

**Abstract:** Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the concern of misuse of large language models and the need for effective detection methods that balance accuracy and societal risks associated with false positive rates.

**Method:** The authors propose a Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework incorporating Multiscaled Conformal Prediction (MCP) to manage false positive rates while enhancing detection performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new detection framework (MCP) that balances FPR constraints and performance
	2. Development of RealDet, a high-quality dataset for calibration
	3. Empirical evidence demonstrating enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.

**Result:** Empirical evaluations show that MCP significantly reduces false positive rates and improves detection performance, while being robust against adversarial attacks across various detectors and datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed MCP framework successfully addresses the trade-off between false positive rates and detection performance, providing a promising solution for detecting machine-generated text.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result, developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks across multiple detectors and datasets.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of neuron-based or internal-activation-based methods in analyzing multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.

**Method:** The paper employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose LLM activations into sparse linear combinations of features for a nuanced analysis of monolinguality and to enhance steering vectors for language control.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel metric for assessing monolinguality of SAE features in LLMs
	2. Discovery of language-specific features from SAEs that impact model performance
	3. Demonstration of improved steering capabilities for LLMs through SAE-derived features.

**Result:** SAEs provide a novel metric to assess feature monolinguality, revealing that some features strongly correlate with specific languages and that their ablation impacts performance variably across languages.

**Limitations:** The analysis may be limited to the specific language features derived from SAEs and their interaction effects in LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that leveraging SAE-derived language-specific features can achieve improved control over generated language in LLMs, suggesting a new direction for enhancing multilingual interaction in AI systems.

**Abstract:** The mechanisms behind multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been examined using neuron-based or internal-activation-based methods. However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language generated by LLMs.

**Abstract:** The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing. Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further MNER research in low-resource languages.

**Motivation:** To enhance the performance of aspect sentiment triplet extraction using the strong relational capabilities of transformers while addressing challenges in computational efficiency and attention mechanisms.

**Method:** The study introduces a Table-Transformer (T-T) model with a stripe attention mechanism and loop-shift strategy to optimize the processing of long input sequences in a tagging-based ASTE approach.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a Table-Transformer model for ASTE
	2. Development of stripe attention mechanism
	3. Implementation of loop-shift strategy for attention interaction

**Result:** The proposed T-T model achieves state-of-the-art performance in aspect sentiment triplet extraction with reduced computational costs compared to previous methods.

**Limitations:** Potential scalability issues with extremely long input sentences beyond practical limits.

**Conclusion:** The Table-Transformer effectively utilizes transformer layers for downstream relation learning, significantly improving the tagging-based ASTE method.

**Abstract:** Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.

**Abstract:** In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative processes.

This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient data selection methods for instruction tuning in LLMs that avoid gradient-based costs and manual heuristics.

**Method:** ICon measures sample contribution through implicit learning in in-context learning, avoiding the need for gradients or heuristics, and identifies high-contribution data based on performance shifts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ICon, a novel method for data selection
	2. Demonstration of superior performance with reduced dataset sizes
	3. Analysis of selected samples showing diversity and appropriate difficulty levels

**Result:** Models trained on ICon-selected data outperform those trained on full datasets significantly, achieving better performance with just 15% of the data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ICon demonstrates superior data selection efficiency, identifying diverse and appropriately challenging samples that improve LLM performance without manual bias.

**Abstract:** Data selection for instruction tuning is essential for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing training cost. However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12 benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.

**Method:** The authors analyze out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news articles to assess the degree of framing bias compared to human-generated content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the presence of framing biases in LLM-generated news content.
	2. Compares framing tendencies between LLMs and human authors.
	3. Identifies architectural variations in framing biases across different LLMs.

**Result:** The research finds that LLM-generated news content exhibits stronger framing biases, especially in politically and socially sensitive issues, with significant variations across different model architectures.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on specific model architectures and may not account for all possible configurations and contexts.

**Conclusion:** The results highlight the importance of implementing post-training strategies and better evaluation frameworks to ensure balanced reporting in automated news content.

**Abstract:** Framing in media critically shapes public perception by selectively emphasizing some details while downplaying others. With the rise of large language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the multilingual reasoning capabilities of English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) and their performance in mathematical reasoning across different languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Explore the generalization of English reasoning finetuning with chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) across various languages, especially highlighting the potential of RLMs in multilingual contexts.

**Method:** The study examines the scaling of inference compute for English-focused RLMs and assesses their performance in multilingual reasoning tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Improved multilingual reasoning capabilities of English-centric RLMs
	2. Established effective strategies for controlling the language of CoT reasoning
	3. Identified limitations in out-of-domain reasoning generalization

**Result:** Improved multilingual mathematical reasoning was observed, with English-centric RLMs outperforming larger models in low-resource languages. CoTs predominantly in English follow a quote-and-think pattern with non-English inputs.

**Limitations:** Weak generalization from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge for English models and challenges in lower-resource languages.

**Conclusion:** While there are strengths in reasoning with high-resource languages, challenges remain in low-resource languages and out-of-domain reasoning, indicating a need for further research in these areas.

**Abstract:** Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

**Keywords:** Chain-of-Thought, AI safety, reasoning models, monitoring, reinforcement learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in AI models, finding that while CoTs can indicate model behaviors, their effectiveness is limited and can lead to reward hacking without capturing all unexpected behaviors.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper investigates how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can help in monitoring AI models to understand their intentions and to promote AI safety.

**Method:** The authors evaluate the faithfulness of CoTs across six reasoning hints in prompts by analyzing various state-of-the-art models and their response patterns in relation to hint utilization and reinforcement learning methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of CoT faithfulness across multiple models
	2. Insights into the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on CoT reasoning
	3. Identification of limitations in using CoTs for reliable behavior monitoring

**Result:** Most models tested show that CoTs reveal hint usage in at least 1% of examples, but the rate is often below 20%. Reinforcement learning improves faithfulness initially but plateaus, and increases in hint utilization do not correspond with higher verbalization rates.

**Limitations:** CoTs may not capture rare and catastrophic behaviors effectively, particularly in settings where CoT reasoning is not central.

**Conclusion:** CoT monitoring is a promising tool for detecting undesired behaviors in models, but it is insufficient to fully understand or eliminate such behaviors, especially when CoT reasoning is not fundamental.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.

**TL;DR:** TransProQA is a novel LLM-based framework for evaluating literary translations that prioritizes artistic expression over mechanical accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics that emphasize mechanical accuracy and potentially harm translation quality and cultural authenticity.

**Method:** TransProQA integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on literary quality assessment through question-answering techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a reference-free, LLM-based evaluation metric for literary translation.
	2. Significant performance improvements over current state-of-the-art metrics.
	3. Integration of professional translator insights to enhance evaluation outcomes.

**Result:** TransProQA significantly outperforms existing metrics, achieving a correlation gain of up to 0.07 and exceeding state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance and has broad applicability to open-source models, making it a valuable tool for literary text evaluation without requiring training.

**Abstract:** The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

**TL;DR:** Introducing a strategy for efficient data verification and filtering to enhance the quality of datasets used for training large language models (LLMs).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve model performance of LLMs by addressing challenges in data quality and seed data selection.

**Method:** An efficient verification strategy for rapid evaluation of data impact on LLM training, and a data filtering pipeline optimizing the selection of positive and negative samples using a lightweight fastText classifier.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an efficient verification strategy for data quality evaluation
	2. Creation of the Ultra-FineWeb dataset
	3. Optimized data filtering pipeline integrating seed data selection with verification.

**Result:** The pipeline was applied to FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, creating the Ultra-FineWeb dataset with approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens, leading to significant performance improvements in LLMs across benchmark tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods effectively enhance data quality and training efficiency for large language models.

**Abstract:** Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the isolation of evaluations in existing research on dialogue systems, which limits the generalizability of findings across different architectures.

**Method:** The authors propose clem todd as a flexible framework for systematic evaluation of dialogue systems, allowing for detailed benchmarking across various user simulators and dialogue systems, with uniform datasets and evaluation metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of clem todd for systematic evaluation of dialogue systems.

**Result:** The results show that using clem todd provides actionable insights into the impact of architecture, scale, and prompting strategies on the performance of dialogue systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework enables improved evaluation and development of conversational AI systems by standardizing conditions for assessments.

**Abstract:** The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd (chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

**Motivation:** To better understand how to integrate visual and reasoning capabilities in AI models, specifically through the mechanism of model merging across different modalities.

**Method:** The authors propose a novel approach to merge parameters of VLMs and LLMs, allowing for the transfer of reasoning capabilities from LLMs to VLMs without direct training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a novel merging approach across modalities (VLM and LLM)
	2. Demonstrates successful transfer of reasoning capabilities in a training-free manner
	3. Offers insights into the layer-wise contribution to perception and reasoning abilities after merging.

**Result:** Through experiments, the study shows that model merging enables the early layers to maintain perception abilities while enhancing reasoning across all layers of the merged model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Model merging represents a promising approach for improving multimodal capabilities and understanding the integration of perception and reasoning in AI models.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.

**Motivation:** Direct alignment methods for aligning large language models with human preferences face challenges due to noisy preference pairs, leading to verbosity and likelihood displacement.

**Method:** Introduction of a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles with a convergence guarantee; enhancement of the method using heuristics and experimental validation on various LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Experimental evaluations on models like Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Gemma-2-9B demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving model performance with noisy preference pairs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the necessity of specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margins, suggesting an alternative approach to existing direct alignment techniques.

**Abstract:** Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of adaptive testing in AI evaluation

**Result:** Adopting psychometrics can provide more reliable and efficient evaluations by uncovering latent traits in model performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Psychometrics offers a promising framework for enhancing the evaluation of AI systems, ensuring more accurate assessments than traditional methods.

**Abstract:** As AI systems continue to evolve, their rigorous evaluation becomes crucial for their development and deployment. Researchers have constructed various large-scale benchmarks to determine their capabilities, typically against a gold-standard test set and report metrics averaged across all items. However, this static evaluation paradigm increasingly shows its limitations, including high evaluation costs, data contamination, and the impact of low-quality or erroneous items on evaluation reliability and efficiency. In this Position, drawing from human psychometrics, we discuss a paradigm shift from static evaluation methods to adaptive testing. This involves estimating the characteristics or value of each test item in the benchmark, and tailoring each model's evaluation instead of relying on a fixed test set. This paradigm provides robust ability estimation, uncovering the latent traits underlying a model's observed scores. This position paper analyze the current possibilities, prospects, and reasons for adopting psychometrics in AI evaluation. We argue that psychometrics, a theory originating in the 20th century for human assessment, could be a powerful solution to the challenges in today's AI evaluations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance event argument extraction by addressing the challenges of irrelevant retrieval results and independent event template development.

**Method:** DEGAP uses dual prefixes—instance-oriented and template-oriented—to learn relevant information and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to leverage connections between different events.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of dual prefixes for different event instances and templates
	2. Development of an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

**Result:** The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets: ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DEGAP effectively captures and utilizes relevant information for EAE, outperforming previous methods and providing insights into the utility of its components.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating useful auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as retrieved instances and event templates. These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the oversimplification in the study of memorization in language models by considering specific factors that influence memorization.

**Method:** The authors develop a taxonomy categorizing memorization into three types: recitation of duplicated sequences, reconstruction of predictable sequences, and recollection of sequences that are neither. They construct a predictive model based on these categories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a taxonomy for types of memorization in language models
	2. Development of a predictive model for memorization based on the taxonomy
	3. Analysis of dependencies that influence memorization likelihood across categories

**Result:** The study finds that various factors affecting memorization operate differently across the taxonomic categories, which aids in understanding the memorization behavior of language models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed taxonomy and predictive model provide valuable insights into the complex nature of memorization in language models, enhancing our understanding of their behavior.

**Abstract:** Memorization in language models is typically treated as a homogenous phenomenon, neglecting the specifics of the memorized data. We instead model memorization as the effect of a set of complex factors that describe each sample and relate it to the model and corpus. To build intuition around these factors, we break memorization down into a taxonomy: recitation of highly duplicated sequences, reconstruction of inherently predictable sequences, and recollection of sequences that are neither. We demonstrate the usefulness of our taxonomy by using it to construct a predictive model for memorization. By analyzing dependencies and inspecting the weights of the predictive model, we find that different factors influence the likelihood of memorization differently depending on the taxonomic category.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of comprehensive evaluations on quantization methods for large language models, particularly recent models like Llama-3.3.

**Method:** A comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models ranging from 1B to 405B parameters using four quantization methods across 13 datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive evaluation of quantization methods on recent LLMs
	2. Identification of FP8 as the most robust quantization method
	3. Insights into performance variations across model sizes and tasks.

**Result:** Quantized models generally perform better than smaller FP16 baselines; FP8 is the most robust quantization method; accuracy drops for smaller models at 4-bit quantization; and performance declines noted in coding and STEM tasks while reasoning might improve.

**Limitations:** Does not address the underlying algorithmic designs for quantization; focuses primarily on performance metrics.

**Conclusion:** Quantization enhances performance but exposes intrinsic model weaknesses that are not solely related to task difficulty.

**Abstract:** Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper analyzes the effectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in large language models, emphasizing its strong performance in math and logic tasks through a meta-analysis of over 100 papers and evaluations across 20 datasets.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the effectiveness and applicability of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in various tasks involving large language models (LLMs).

**Method:** Conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of over 100 papers on CoT, followed by evaluations on 20 datasets across 14 LLMs to assess performance differences with and without CoT prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analyses the effectiveness of CoT prompting across various tasks.
	2. Finds strong performance benefits primarily in mathematical and logical contexts.
	3. Suggests moving towards new paradigms for LLM applications.

**Result:** CoT provides significant performance improvements mainly for math and logic tasks, with minor gains in other areas. In many cases, directly generating answers yields similar accuracy to CoT, except in cases involving symbolic reasoning.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on CoT in relation to math and logic tasks, which may limit the generalizability of findings to other task domains.

**Conclusion:** CoT can be selectively applied to improve efficiency and maintain performance but underperforms compared to symbolic solvers. The study suggests a need for new paradigms beyond prompt-based CoT.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study introduces a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by enabling them to improve their output quality through self-generated data during inference and fine-tuning stages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the flawed responses generated by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and investigate their self-correction capabilities, which have been underexplored compared to Large Language Models.

**Method:** The study proposes a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach that allows VLMs to utilize self-generated self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without needing external feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Self-Correction Learning (SCL) for VLMs.
	2. Demonstration of preference fine-tuning's impact on VLM performance.
	3. Establishment of the importance of enhancing reasoning capabilities through self-correction.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that while VLMs struggle with self-correction during inference without fine-tuning, they can improve performance significantly through preference fine-tuning when supported by categorized self-correction data.

**Limitations:** The study shows that VLMs are not effective at self-correction during iterative inference alone without additional fine-tuning.

**Conclusion:** Self-correction in VLMs should enhance reasoning abilities and enable high-quality response generation directly, rather than just refining outputs.

**Abstract:** While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in visual and language reasoning tasks, they invariably generate flawed responses. Self-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a promising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on Large Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs, particularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely unexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs during both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without relying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we collect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial and refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs during the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs struggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without additional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their performance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when their self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and disfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a refinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models through additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses directly without further refinement.

**Conclusion:** The release of the WorldCuisines benchmark aims to facilitate future research in culturally diverse visual language understanding by providing extensive datasets and an annotated knowledge base.

**Abstract:** Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.

**Conclusion:** The integration of adaptive filtering in the generation process enhances the quality of information used in LLMs, leading to more accurate outputs.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of large language models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model with adaptive filtering for retrieval-augmented generation (E2E-AFG), which integrates answer existence judgment and text generation into a single end-to-end framework. This enables the model to focus more effectively on relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and generating accurate answers.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the scaling challenges in training large multi-modal models that require extensive datasets and computational resources.

**Method:** MoT decouples non-embedding parameters by modality, allowing modality-specific processing along with global self-attention over the entire input sequence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel sparse multi-modal transformer architecture (MoT).
	2. Showed significant reductions in computational costs for training compared to traditional dense models.
	3. Provided empirical results demonstrating MoT's efficiency in text, image, and speech processing tasks.

**Result:** MoT achieves performance comparable to dense baselines with significantly reduced FLOPs: 55.8% for text-and-image generation and 37.2% for speech processing; outperforming dense baselines in some tasks with lesser resources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MoT demonstrates practical efficiency gains in training multi-modal models, providing similar quality outputs much faster and with fewer resources.

**Abstract:** The development of large language models (LLMs) has expanded to multi-modal systems capable of processing text, images, and speech within a unified framework. Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2\% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6\% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a significant issue with biases in LLMs that often misrepresent diverse cultural values, which can lead to fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications.

**Method:** ValuesRAG employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation combined with In-Context Learning to dynamically incorporate cultural knowledge extracted from the World Values Survey and curated regional datasets during the text generation process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ValuesRAG framework for culturally aligned LLMs.
	2. Demonstrated superior performance over existing methods with diverse regional datasets.
	3. Innovative integration of culture-specific summaries into AI text generation.

**Result:** The evaluation shows that ValuesRAG outperforms existing methodologies (zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, hybrid methods) across 6 diverse regional datasets, achieving the best overall performance in fostering culturally aligned AI systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the effectiveness of dynamic retrieval methods in addressing biases in LLMs and facilitating more inclusive AI systems that respect and incorporate a range of cultural values.

**Abstract:** Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel method for communication between language model agents using internal activations instead of natural language, demonstrating improved efficiency and performance.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high computational costs and limitations of natural language as a communication medium between LM agents, and to explore more efficient alternatives.

**Method:** The approach involves pausing an LM's computation at an intermediate layer, combining its current activation with another LM's activation using a function, and continuing the forward pass without additional parameters or data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of activation-based communication for LMs
	2. Demonstrated significant performance improvement over traditional methods
	3. Efficiency gains with reduced computational costs

**Result:** The proposed method achieves up to 27.0% performance improvement over natural language communication while utilizing less than a quarter of the computational resources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Activations serve as a robust and efficient alternative language for LM communication, enhancing their reasoning capabilities without added data or parameters.

**Abstract:** Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the significant safety deficiencies of DeepSeek models revealed in prior research and the lack of safety evaluations specifically tailored to Chinese contexts, which are critical given the models' performance in both languages.

**Method:** The study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a systematic evaluation benchmark designed to assess the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese, quantifying their performance across various safety categories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CHiSafetyBench for assessing DeepSeek model safety in Chinese contexts
	2. Quantitative evaluation revealing performance deficiencies in Chinese safety assessments
	3. Recognition of the need for equal safety evaluation efforts in both English and Chinese environments

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 exhibit significant safety vulnerabilities when evaluated in Chinese contexts, mirroring their issues found in English.

**Limitations:** Potential biases in test sample selection, data distribution characteristics, and evaluation criteria settings may affect results.

**Conclusion:** While the paper establishes a crucial evaluation benchmark for DeepSeek models in Chinese contexts, it acknowledges potential biases in sample selection and evaluation criteria and commits to ongoing optimization of the benchmark.

**Abstract:** Recently, the DeepSeek series of models, leveraging their exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is reshaping the global AI landscape. Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and accurate assessment outcomes. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the most recent evaluation results and conclusions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a training-free personalization method for LLMs
	2. Demonstrated high performance with significantly fewer examples compared to RLHF
	3. Provides an interpretable model of user preferences using predefined attributes

**Result:** Drift outperforms traditional RLHF methods on both synthetic and real datasets using only 50-100 examples, indicating its efficiency and effectiveness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Drift offers a computationally efficient and interpretable solution for personalizing large language models without retraining.

**Abstract:** Personalized alignments for individual users have been a long-standing goal in large language models (LLMs). We introduce Drift, a novel framework that personalizes LLMs at decoding time with implicit user preferences. Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) requires thousands of annotated examples and expensive gradient updates. In contrast, Drift personalizes LLMs in a training-free manner, using only a few dozen examples to steer a frozen model through efficient preference modeling. Our approach models user preferences as a composition of predefined, interpretable attributes and aligns them at decoding time to enable personalized generation. Experiments on both a synthetic persona dataset (Perspective) and a real human-annotated dataset (PRISM) demonstrate that Drift significantly outperforms RLHF baselines while using only 50-100 examples. Our results and analysis show that Drift is both computationally efficient and interpretable.

**Motivation:** Large language models often generate nonfactual information in medical tasks, making it crucial to establish trustworthiness in medical QA scenarios.

**Method:** The paper proposes a conformal prediction framework that incorporates non-conformance scores with correct option frequencies and uses self-consistency and a monotonic loss function for risk control.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Enhanced conformal prediction framework for medical QA
	2. Integration of non-conformance scores with correct option frequencies
	3. Risk control strategy with a monotonic loss function

**Result:** The method successfully meets specified error rate guarantees while minimizing the average prediction set size across evaluated datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The enhanced framework provides a promising uncertainty evaluation metric for improving the reliability of LLMs in medical QA tasks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in medical question-answering (QA) scenarios. However, LLMs can generate hallucinations and nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a statistically rigorous framework for marginal (average) coverage guarantees but has limited exploration in medical QA. This paper proposes an enhanced CP framework for medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks. By associating the non-conformance score with the frequency score of correct options and leveraging self-consistency, the framework addresses internal model opacity and incorporates a risk control strategy with a monotonic loss function. Evaluated on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU datasets using four off-the-shelf LLMs, the proposed method meets specified error rate guarantees while reducing average prediction set size with increased risk level, offering a promising uncertainty evaluation metric for LLMs.

**Result:** Results indicate that LLMs provide limited advantages over BERT-like models, yet they excel in facilitating iterative dialogues by asking pertinent questions.

**Limitations:** Limited advantages of LLMs over BERT-like models may indicate a need for further optimization in specific healthcare tasks.

**Conclusion:** The proposed evaluation framework offers a structured way to assess LLM performance specifically in outpatient referral contexts, highlighting the need for improved evaluation methodologies.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.

**Motivation:** The application of LLMs to healthcare is promising, but performance varies significantly across tasks and models, necessitating task-specific selection.

**Method:** The authors assessed five open-source LLMs on six healthcare classification tasks, analyzing precision, recall, and F1 scores while providing 95% confidence intervals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Benchmarking performance of multiple LLMs in healthcare classification tasks
	2. Highlighting the variability in performance based on task and data type
	3. Emphasizing the importance of task-specific model selection over model size.

**Result:** DeepSeekV3 performed best overall, particularly on social media tasks, with notable performance variability; GEMMA-3-27B-IT showed high recall despite fewer parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Healthcare applications should prioritize task-specific model selection over mere parameter count, highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation of LLMs for healthcare.

**Abstract:** The application of large language models (LLMs) to healthcare information extraction has emerged as a promising approach. This study evaluates the classification performance of five open-source LLMs: GEMMA-3-27B-IT, LLAMA3-70B, LLAMA4-109B, DEEPSEEK-R1-DISTILL-LLAMA-70B, and DEEPSEEK-V3-0324-UD-Q2_K_XL, across six healthcare-related classification tasks involving both social media data (breast cancer, changes in medication regimen, adverse pregnancy outcomes, potential COVID-19 cases) and clinical data (stigma labeling, medication change discussion). We report precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals for all model-task combinations. Our findings reveal significant performance variability between LLMs, with DeepSeekV3 emerging as the strongest overall performer, achieving the highest F1 scores in four tasks. Notably, models generally performed better on social media tasks compared to clinical data tasks, suggesting potential domain-specific challenges. GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results. We observed distinct precision-recall trade-offs across models, with some favoring sensitivity over specificity and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific model selection for healthcare applications, considering the particular data domain and precision-recall requirements rather than model size alone. As healthcare increasingly integrates AI-driven text classification tools, this comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable guidance for model selection and implementation while underscoring the need for continued evaluation and domain adaptation of LLMs in healthcare contexts.
