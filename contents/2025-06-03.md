  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve advertisement design and product recommendations by analyzing eye gaze patterns.

**Method:** The proposed method constructs a hierarchical structure of Areas of Interest (AOI) to convert gaze trajectories into symbol sequences, utilizing N-grams to extract and visualize transition patterns between AOIs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a hierarchical AOI structure for gaze trajectory analysis
	2. Use of N-grams for pattern extraction in gaze data
	3. Effective visualization of gaze transition differences among participants

**Result:** The method efficiently visualizes gaze transition trends and differences among multiple participants in eye-tracking experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Analysts can better understand gaze behaviors, enhancing insights into interaction patterns with visual stimuli.

**Abstract:** By analyzing the gaze trajectories of people viewing screens and advertisements, we can determine what people are interested in. This knowledge can be effective when recommending commercial products and services, and also, when improving advertisement design. Therefore, analysis and visualization of eye gaze have been an active research topic. This paper proposes a new method for visualizing patterns of the gaze trajectories of multiple people by (1) visualizing patterns that move through multiple areas of interest (AOI) and (2) visualizing differences among multiple gaze trajectories. The method first constructs a hierarchical AOI structure to a Web page or an image, and uses this structure to convert the trajectory into a sequence of symbols. We apply N-grams to the generated symbol sequences to extract transition patterns between AOIs. Finally, the method visualizes a list of the pattern extraction results and the shapes of the characteristic elements. We present the visualization of gaze trajectories for three examples of stimuli, and argue that analysts can efficiently discover trends in gaze transitions between text and figures, as well as differences between participants of the eye-tracking experiments.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance patient-centered care through serious illness conversations between clinicians and patients with serious illnesses, particularly in emergency settings where communication is crucial yet challenging.

**Method:** Interviews with two domain experts and nine ED clinical care team members, followed by thematic analysis to characterize SIC workflows and identify needs and challenges.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Characterization of a four-phase SIC workflow
	2. Identification of barriers faced by clinical care teams during SICs

**Result:** The study identified a four-phase workflow for SICs and highlighted significant barriers such as EHR data access issues, time constraints, and the need for emotional preparation, alongside a desire for AI tools to assist in these areas.

**Limitations:** Focus on a limited sample size from specific clinical settings may limit generalizability of findings.

**Conclusion:** Design guidelines for AI tools supporting SIC workflows are proposed, ensuring they align with current clinical practices while maintaining human connection and clinician autonomy.

**Abstract:** Serious illness conversations (SICs), discussions between clinical care teams and patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses about their values, goals, and care preferences, are critical for patient-centered care. Without these conversations, patients often receive aggressive interventions that may not align with their goals. Clinical care teams face significant barriers when conducting serious illness conversations with older adult patients in Emergency Department (ED) settings, where most older adult patients lack documented treatment goals. To understand current practices and identify AI support opportunities, we conducted interviews with two domain experts and nine ED clinical care team members. Through thematic analysis, we characterized a four-phase serious illness conversation workflow (identification, preparation, conduction, documentation) and identified key needs and challenges at each stage. Clinical care teams struggle with fragmented EHR data access, time constraints, emotional preparation demands, and documentation burdens. While participants expressed interest in AI tools for information synthesis, conversational support, and automated documentation, they emphasized preserving human connection and clinical autonomy. We present design guidelines for AI tools supporting SIC workflows that fit within existing clinical practices. This work contributes empirical understanding of ED-based serious illness conversations and provides design considerations for AI in high-stakes clinical environments.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how geographic separation affects the communication between immigrant grandparents and grandchildren, as existing research mainly focuses on non-immigrant or co-located families.

**Method:** Interviews with six Chinese immigrant families in Canada were conducted to gather insights on their remote communication experiences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies specific challenges in remote communication for immigrant families.
	2. Highlights the impact of language and cultural barriers due to geographic separation.
	3. Provides empirical insights for the design of supportive technology.

**Result:** The research identifies significant language and cultural barriers exacerbated by geographic distance, offering insights into how technology can bridge these gaps.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by its small sample size and focus on only one cultural group (Chinese immigrants in Canada).

**Conclusion:** The work enhances the understanding of the communication needs of dispersed immigrant families and suggests directions for future technological support in maintaining grandparent-grandchild relationships.

**Abstract:** Grandparent-grandchild bonds are crucial for both parties. Many immigrant families are geographically dispersed, and the grandparents and grandchildren need to rely on remote communication to maintain their relationships. In addition to geographical separation, grandparents and grandchildren in such families also face language and culture barriers during remote communication. The associated challenges and needs remain understudied as existing research primarily focuses on non-immigrant families or co-located immigrant families. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with six Chinese immigrant families in Canada. Our findings highlight unique challenges faced by immigrant families during remote communication, such as amplified language and cultural barriers due to geographic separation, and provide insights into how technology can better support remote communication. This work offers empirical knowledge about the communication needs of distributed immigrant families and provides directions for future research and design to support grandparent-grandchild remote communication in these families.

*Mina Huh, Zihui Xue, Ujjaini Das, Kumar Ashutosh, Kristen Grauman, Amy Pavel*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Blind and Low Vision, Accessible Technology, AI Assistance

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Vid2Coach is a system designed to assist blind and low vision individuals by transforming how-to videos into accessible, wearable camera-based guidance, enhancing their learning experience in tasks like cooking.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve accessibility for blind and low vision (BLV) individuals using how-to videos, which are typically reliant on visual cues that they cannot perceive.

**Method:** Vid2Coach utilizes a combination of narrated instructions and augmented details derived from videos. It employs retrieval-augmented generation to produce non-visual workarounds and monitors user progress using a camera in smart glasses to provide real-time feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Vid2Coach for enhancing accessibility of how-to videos
	2. Integration of retrieval-augmented generation for non-visual guidance
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness through user studies with BLV individuals

**Result:** Users completing tasks with Vid2Coach made 58.5% fewer errors than with their usual methods, indicating significant improvement in task execution.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Vid2Coach not only enhances accessibility but also represents a new approach to leveraging AI for visual assistance, maintaining the importance of non-visual expertise.

**Abstract:** People use videos to learn new recipes, exercises, and crafts. Such videos remain difficult for blind and low vision (BLV) people to follow as they rely on visual comparison. Our observations of visual rehabilitation therapists (VRTs) guiding BLV people to follow how-to videos revealed that VRTs provide both proactive and responsive support including detailed descriptions, non-visual workarounds, and progress feedback. We propose Vid2Coach, a system that transforms how-to videos into wearable camera-based assistants that provide accessible instructions and mixed-initiative feedback. From the video, Vid2Coach generates accessible instructions by augmenting narrated instructions with demonstration details and completion criteria for each step. It then uses retrieval-augmented-generation to extract relevant non-visual workarounds from BLV-specific resources. Vid2Coach then monitors user progress with a camera embedded in commercial smart glasses to provide context-aware instructions, proactive feedback, and answers to user questions. BLV participants (N=8) using Vid2Coach completed cooking tasks with 58.5\% fewer errors than when using their typical workflow and wanted to use Vid2Coach in their daily lives. Vid2Coach demonstrates an opportunity for AI visual assistance that strengthens rather than replaces non-visual expertise.

**TL;DR:** CO-OPERA is a collaborative playwriting tool that uses generative AI to assist in the playwriting process, enhancing logical narrative development for students.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current AI tools are ineffective in supporting teachers and students during playwriting, highlighting the need for a specialized solution.

**Method:** The study involved need-finding interviews with 13 teachers and the development of the CO-OPERA tool, which integrates generative AI for collaborative playwriting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CO-OPERA as a generative AI tool for playwriting
	2. Usability validation through testing with middle school students
	3. Creation of a collaborative environment for narrative development

**Result:** A usability test with middle school students demonstrated that CO-OPERA enables users to better focus on the logical progression of their narratives during the writing process.

**Limitations:** The study's findings are based on a small sample size of 13 teachers and a single usability test with middle school students.

**Conclusion:** CO-OPERA improves playwriting by facilitating discussion and iterative modifications, thereby enhancing the overall narrative development experience.

**Abstract:** Drama-in-education is an interdisciplinary instructional approach that integrates subjects such as language, history, and psychology. Its core component is playwriting. Based on need-finding interviews of 13 teachers, we found that current general-purpose AI tools cannot effectively assist teachers and students during playwriting. Therefore, we propose CO-OPERA - a collaborative playwriting tool integrating generative artificial intelligence capabilities. In CO-OPERA, users can both expand their thinking through discussions with a tutor and converge their thinking by operating agents to generate script elements. Additionally, the system allows for iterative modifications and regenerations based on user requirements. A system usability test conducted with middle school students shows that our CO-OPERA helps users focus on whole logical narrative development during playwriting. Our playwriting examples and raw data for qualitative and quantitative analysis are available at https://github.com/daisyinb612/CO-OPERA.

### [6] [Fast SSVEP Detection Using a Calibration-Free EEG Decoding Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01284)

*Chenlong Wang, Jiaao Li, Shuailei Zhang, Wenbo Ding, Xinlei Chen*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** SSVEP, brain-computer interfaces, EEG signal decoding, data augmentation, deep learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** Proposed a novel calibration-free EEG signal decoding framework enhancing SSVEP detection for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) with superior accuracy and reduced resource requirements.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Growth in brain-computer interfaces necessitates improved SSVEP detection methods that are both accurate and require minimal user-specific calibration.

**Method:** Integrated Inter-Trial Remixing & Context-Aware Distribution Alignment data augmentation techniques and a compact architecture of fully connected layers, alongside an Adaptive Spectrum Denoise Module for improved EEG data quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Calibration-free EEG signal decoding framework
	2. Integration of innovative data augmentation techniques for EEG signals
	3. Adaptive Spectrum Denoise Module for improved data quality

**Result:** Demonstrated significant accuracy improvements over traditional methods with at least 52.7% fewer parameters and 29.9% less inference time in calibration-free classification on short EEG signals from three datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework enhances BCI usability, facilitating broader application and commercialization, as it eliminates the need for extensive individual calibration.

**Abstract:** Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential is a brain response to visual stimuli flickering at constant frequencies. It is commonly used in brain-computer interfaces for direct brain-device communication due to their simplicity, minimal training data, and high information transfer rate. Traditional methods suffer from poor performance due to reliance on prior knowledge, while deep learning achieves higher accuracy but requires substantial high-quality training data for precise signal decoding. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free EEG signal decoding framework for fast SSVEP detection. Our framework integrates Inter-Trial Remixing & Context-Aware Distribution Alignment data augmentation for EEG signals and employs a compact architecture of small fully connected layers, effectively addressing the challenge of limited EEG data availability. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Spectrum Denoise Module that operates in the frequency domain based on global features, requiring only linear complexity to reduce noise in EEG data and improve data quality. For calibration-free classification experiments on short EEG signals from three public datasets, our framework demonstrates statistically significant accuracy advantages(p<0.05) over existing methods in the majority of cases, while requiring at least 52.7% fewer parameters and 29.9% less inference time. By eliminating the need for user-specific calibration, this advancement significantly enhances the usability of BCI systems, accelerating their commercialization and widespread adoption in real-world applications.

### [7] [How Problematic are Suspenseful Interactions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01287)

*Alarith Uhde*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** social acceptability, suspenseful interactions, interactive technology, human-computer interaction, replication study

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the social acceptability of suspenseful interactions in interactive technologies, finding them less problematic than previously thought despite some negative perceptions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To challenge the weak empirical support for the social acceptability guidelines that deem suspenseful interactions problematic.

**Method:** A controlled replication study was conducted with 281 participants to assess the 'suspensefulness effect' across different social acceptability measures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Controlled replication study of the suspensefulness effect
	2. Quantitative analysis of social acceptability measures
	3. Recommendations for improving social acceptability in technology

**Result:** The study found that suspenseful interactions were statistically replicated with two out of three social acceptability measures, although effect sizes were small and overall acceptability scores were high.

**Limitations:** Effect sizes were small, indicating that while there is a slight negative perception, it is not significant in the broader context of social acceptability.

**Conclusion:** Despite some slight negative effects on social acceptability, suspenseful interactions are not as problematic as suggested by current guidelines, calling for more context-aware evaluations of technology.

**Abstract:** Current "social acceptability" guidelines for interactive technologies advise against certain, seemingly problematic forms of interaction. Specifically, "suspenseful" interactions, characterized by visible manipulations and invisible effects, are generally considered be problematic. However, the empirical grounding for this claim is surprisingly weak. To test its validity, this paper presents a controlled replication study (n = 281) of the "suspensefulness effect". Although it could be statistically replicated with two out of three social acceptability measures, effect sizes were small (r =< .2), and all compared forms of interaction, including the suspenseful one, had high absolute social acceptability scores. Thus, despite the slight negative effect, suspenseful interactions seem less problematic in the overall scheme of things. We discuss alternative approaches to improve the social acceptability of interactive technology, and recommend to more closely engage with their specific social situatedness.

In this study, we explore how AI-generated music can augment the journaling experience. Through a formative study, we examined journal writers' writing patterns, purposes, emotional regulation strategies, and the design requirements for the system that augments journaling experience by journal-based AI-generated music. Based on these insights, we developed NoRe, a system that transforms journal entries into personalized music using generative AI. In a seven-day in-the-wild study (N=15), we investigated user engagement and perceived emotional effectiveness through system logs, surveys, and interviews. Our findings suggest that journal-based music generation could support emotional reflection and provide vivid reminiscence of daily experiences. Drawing from these findings, we discuss design implications for tailoring music to journal writers' emotional states and preferences.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Proposes an adaptive takeover warning system for semi-automated vehicles that personalizes warnings based on driver states to enhance safety and situational awareness.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance safety in conditionally automated driving by personalizing takeover warning systems to accommodate different driver states.

**Method:** Conducted two user studies in rural and urban settings with participants performing non-driving-related tasks while measuring the effectiveness of various display types and timing for takeover warnings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a personalized adaptive takeover warning system
	2. Insights from user studies on driver states and display types
	3. Recommendations for designing safer semi-automated driving systems

**Result:** Identified effective strategies for designing adaptable takeover systems, recommending longer time budgets and head-up displays for non-hazardous events in complex environments, and shorter budgets with head-down displays for hazardous events in simpler environments.

**Limitations:** Results may vary across different driver profiles and environments outside of those studied.

**Conclusion:** An adaptive system can improve driver safety and engagement by tailoring warning protocols to specific driving contexts and mental states.

**Abstract:** With the automotive industry transitioning towards conditionally automated driving, takeover warning systems are crucial for ensuring safe collaborative driving between users and semi-automated vehicles. However, previous work has focused on static warning systems that do not accommodate different driver states. Therefore, we propose an adaptive takeover warning system that is personalised to drivers, enhancing their experience and safety. We conducted two user studies investigating semi-autonomous driving scenarios in rural and urban environments while participants performed non-driving-related tasks such as text entry and visual search. We investigated the effects of varying time budgets and head-up versus head-down displays for takeover requests on drivers' situational awareness and mental state. Through our statistical and clustering analyses, we propose strategies for designing adaptable takeover systems, e.g., using longer time budgets and head-up displays for non-hazardous takeover events in high-complexity environments while using shorter time budgets and head-down displays for hazardous events in low-complexity environments.

	2. Development of perceptual filters for extracting metrics
	3. User study validating effectiveness of LLM feedback

**Result:** User study results show that both novice and experienced visualization designers benefitted from using the LLM-guided feedback, leading to refined visualizations over the course of several days.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that natural language guidance via LLMs can significantly support visualization designers in enhancing their work.

**Abstract:** Interactive visualization editors empower users to author visualizations without writing code, but do not provide guidance on the art and craft of effective visual communication. In this paper, we explore the potential of using an off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to provide actionable and customized feedback to visualization designers. Our implementation, VISUALIZATIONARY, demonstrates how ChatGPT can be used for this purpose through two key components: a preamble of visualization design guidelines and a suite of perceptual filters that extract salient metrics from a visualization image. We present findings from a longitudinal user study involving 13 visualization designers-6 novices, 4 intermediates, and 3 experts-who authored a new visualization from scratch over several days. Our results indicate that providing guidance in natural language via an LLM can aid even seasoned designers in refining their visualizations.

### [11] ["Cold, Calculated, and Condescending": How AI Identifies and Explains Ableism Compared to Disabled People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03448)

*Mahika Phutane, Ananya Seelam, Aditya Vashistha*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** ableism, machine learning, human-computer interaction, toxicity, disability

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study examines the effectiveness of AI models in moderating online ableist speech against persons with disabilities (PwD) by comparing AI ratings with human assessments.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how well AI models identify ableist speech and align their judgments with those of persons with disabilities, given the prevalence of ableism online.

**Method:** The study involved curating a dataset of 200 social media comments aimed at PwD and comparing scores of toxicity and ableism provided by state-of-the-art AI models to those of 190 participants who also rated and explained their perspectives on the comments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First dataset focusing on ableist speech against PwD
	2. Comparison of AI model performance to human ratings
	3. Highlighting the need for intersectional input in AI moderation design

**Result:** AI models underestimated toxicity compared to PwD evaluations and had inconsistent ableism assessments; their explanations lacked nuance and were often flawed.

**Limitations:** The study's dataset is limited to 200 comments and may not reflect broader online discourse; AI model limitations in understanding context were also noted.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for more nuanced AI moderation systems that incorporate perspectives from disabled individuals to effectively address ableism in online spaces.

**Abstract:** People with disabilities (PwD) regularly encounter ableist hate and microaggressions online. These spaces are generally moderated by machine learning models, but little is known about how effectively AI models identify ableist speech and how well their judgments align with PwD. To investigate this, we curated a first-of-its-kind dataset of 200 social media comments targeted towards PwD, and prompted state-of-the art AI models (i.e., Toxicity Classifiers, LLMs) to score toxicity and ableism for each comment, and explain their reasoning. Then, we recruited 190 participants to similarly rate and explain the harm, and evaluate LLM explanations. Our mixed-methods analysis highlighted a major disconnect: AI underestimated toxicity compared to PwD ratings, while its ableism assessments were sporadic and varied. Although LLMs identified some biases, its explanations were flawed--they lacked nuance, made incorrect assumptions, and appeared judgmental instead of educational. Going forward, we discuss challenges and opportunities in designing moderation systems for ableism, and advocate for the involvement of intersectional disabled perspectives in AI.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the interaction experience between pedestrians and APMVs, and to prevent potential risks associated with these interactions.

**Method:** An experiment was conducted with 42 pedestrian participants, who interacted with APMVs equipped with various eHMIs designed to evoke different subjective evaluations and walking behaviors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of key psychological factors influencing pedestrian behavior during APMV interactions.
	2. Demonstration of effective experimental design for studying human-vehicle interactions.
	3. Establishment of a causal model linking subjective evaluations to pedestrian walking behaviors.

**Result:** The study found causal relationships between pedestrians' subjective evaluations (such as situation awareness and trust in the vehicle) and their walking behaviors during APMV interactions, supporting a previously proposed cognitive-behavioral model.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by the sample size and the specific context of the experiment, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

**Conclusion:** Understanding the psychological processes and causal relationships can enhance the design of eHMIs to improve safety and interaction between pedestrians and APMVs.

**Abstract:** Autonomous personal mobility vehicle (APMV) is a new type of small smart vehicle designed for mixed-traffic environments, including interactions with pedestrians. To enhance the interaction experience between pedestrians and APMVs and to prevent potential risks, it is crucial to investigate pedestrians' walking behaviors when interacting with APMVs and to understand the psychological processes underlying these behaviors. This study aims to investigate the causal relationships between subjective evaluations of pedestrians and their walking behaviors during interactions with an APMV equipped with an external human-machine interface (eHMI). An experiment of pedestrian-APMV interaction was conducted with 42 pedestrian participants, in which various eHMIs on the APMV were designed to induce participants to experience different levels of subjective evaluations and generate the corresponding walking behaviors. Based on the hypothesized model of the pedestrian's cognition-decision-behavior process, the results of causal discovery align with the previously proposed model. Furthermore, this study further analyzes the direct and total causal effects of each factor and investigates the causal processes affecting several important factors in the field of human-vehicle interaction, such as situation awareness, trust in vehicle, risk perception, hesitation in decision making, and walking behaviors.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Mental Health Care, Ethical Guidelines, Human-AI Alignment, Evaluation Metrics

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper advocates for LLMs in mental health care to be co-creators, emphasizing ethical guidelines and evaluation frameworks to enhance their responsible use.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper highlights the limited adoption of LLMs in mental health care due to concerns about bias, evaluation, and ethical implications, and argues for their reframing as co-creators instead of just assistive tools.

**Method:** The authors propose two structured pathways: SAFE-i Guidelines for ethical deployment and HAAS-e Framework for human-centered evaluation of LLMs in mental health.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SAFE-i Guidelines for ethical LLM use in mental health
	2. Development of the HAAS-e Framework for evaluating LLM impact
	3. Proposing a new perspective of LLMs as co-creators in mental health care

**Result:** Implementing the SAFE-i Guidelines and HAAS-e Framework is expected to enhance the ethical integration of LLMs, ensuring they support mental health care without compromising clinical standards.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper calls for the adoption of these structured approaches to create a responsible and scalable model for using LLMs in mental health care, ensuring AI complements human expertise.

**Abstract:** This position paper argues for a fundamental shift in how Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into the mental health care domain. We advocate for their role as co-creators rather than mere assistive tools. While LLMs have the potential to enhance accessibility, personalization, and crisis intervention, their adoption remains limited due to concerns about bias, evaluation, over-reliance, dehumanization, and regulatory uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose two structured pathways: SAFE-i (Supportive, Adaptive, Fair, and Ethical Implementation) Guidelines for ethical and responsible deployment, and HAAS-e (Human-AI Alignment and Safety Evaluation) Framework for multidimensional, human-centered assessment. SAFE-i provides a blueprint for data governance, adaptive model engineering, and real-world integration, ensuring LLMs align with clinical and ethical standards. HAAS-e introduces evaluation metrics that go beyond technical accuracy to measure trustworthiness, empathy, cultural sensitivity, and actionability. We call for the adoption of these structured approaches to establish a responsible and scalable model for LLM-driven mental health support, ensuring that AI complements, rather than replaces, human expertise.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the effectiveness of different instruction delivery methods (printed vs robot) on worker performance and workload as indicated by physiological signals.

**Method:** Physiological signals (BVP and EDA) were collected during a manual assembly task, and the NASA Task Load Index survey responses were mapped to these signals. CNN and LSTM models were employed for classification tasks to predict workload and compare performance between instruction types.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the effectiveness of using physiological signals for workload prediction in assembly tasks
	2. Provided a comparative analysis of printed vs robot-delivered instructions using machine learning models
	3. Highlighted the superiority of CNN over LSTM in processing physiological signals for task classification.

**Result:** CNN models using multimodal data (BVP and EDA) outperformed those using single signals, showing approximately 17.83% better classification results across all NASA TLX responses compared to LSTMs, with CNNs outperforming LSTMs in overall performance by 7.72%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Utilizing multimodal data enhances classification performance in distinguishing workload based on instruction type, with CNNs being the superior model in this context.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we compare a manual assembly task communicated to workers using both printed and robot-delivered instructions. The comparison was made using physiological signals (blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA)) collected from individuals during an experimental study. In addition, we also collected responses of individuals using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) survey. Furthermore, we mapped the collected physiological signals to the responses of participants for NASA TLX to predict their workload. For both the classification problems, we compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Results show that for our CNN-based approach using multimodal data (both BVP and EDA) gave better results than using just BVP (approx. 8.38% more) and EDA (approx 20.49% more). Our LSTM-based model too had better results when we used multimodal data (approx 8.38% more than just BVP and 6.70% more than just EDA). Overall, CNNs performed better than LSTMs for classifying physiologies for paper vs robot-based instruction by 7.72%. The CNN-based model was able to give better classification results (approximately 17.83% more on an average across all responses of the NASA TLX) within a few minutes of training compared to the LSTM-based models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing reliance on AI programming tools can lead to a lack of user involvement in decision-making, risking critical issues such as software security. This study aims to address this problem by enabling user interaction with LLM outputs.

**Method:** The authors propose the Human-in-the-loop Decoding technique, implemented in the HiLDe assistant, which allows users to observe and influence code generation decisions made by the LLM.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Human-in-the-loop Decoding for AI programming.
	2. Implementation of HiLDe code completion assistant as a case study.
	3. Empirical evidence showing improved security outcomes and user alignment in coding tasks.

**Result:** In a study with 18 participants focused on security-related tasks, HiLDe resulted in fewer generated vulnerabilities and better alignment of code with user goals compared to traditional assistants.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by its small sample size of 18 participants and focuses on specific security-related tasks, which may not generalize to all programming scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Integrating users into the coding process through the HiLDe assistant may enhance software security and the relevance of AI-generated code, encouraging more critical engagement with AI tools.

**Abstract:** While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers' capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.

This study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach offers a systematic method to diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors in LLMs, enhancing their performance without extensive real-world interactions.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs. However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

**Abstract:** In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in natural dialogues.

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses the challenge of proactive error handling in large language models (LLMs) without explicit instructions and introduces the Mis-prompt benchmark for evaluation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current error handling in LLMs relies on explicit instructions, which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios. This paper seeks to address the gap in proactive error handling.

**Method:** The authors introduce a new benchmark called Mis-prompt, which includes four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset to analyze LLM performance on proactive error handling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Mis-prompt benchmark for evaluating proactive error handling in LLMs.
	2. Development of an error category taxonomy and a new evaluation dataset.
	3. Analysis of current LLMs' performance, revealing significant gaps in proactive error handling capabilities.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that current LLMs perform poorly in proactive error handling but demonstrate improved capabilities when fine-tuned on error handling instances.

**Limitations:** The paper primarily focuses on the evaluation aspect and does not propose a specific new approach or mechanism for proactive error handling itself.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that there is a need for proactive error handling in LLMs and the Mis-prompt benchmark will facilitate further research in this area.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner, with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios, explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper, our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs' proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

**TL;DR:** This study compares human and MLM performance on reference word usage, revealing gaps in MLMs' ability to use possessive and demonstrative pronouns.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the largely overlooked ability of multimodal language models (MLMs) to use reference words in comparison to human communication.

**Method:** The study evaluates seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants using three word classes (vocabulary words, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns) with varying cognitive demands.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of gaps in MLMs' use of reference words
	2. Analysis of difficulties stemming from perspective-taking and spatial reasoning
	3. Empirical evaluation of MLMs against human performance across different cognitive tasks

**Result:** MLMs performed well on vocabulary tasks, approaching human-level competence, but struggled significantly with possessive and demonstrative pronouns, revealing deficits in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition presents a clear challenge for current NLP systems, despite improvements through prompt engineering.

**Abstract:** Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task, they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a clear challenge in current NLP systems.

**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes political bias in LLMs across low-resource languages in Pakistan, proposing a framework that combines quantitative and qualitative methods to understand biases.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underexamined political biases of LLMs in non-Western and low-resource multilingual contexts, particularly focusing on their influence in Pakistan.

**Method:** A novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test with multi-level framing analysis, combining quantitative assessments of political orientation with qualitative content analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel framework for analyzing political bias in LLMs in low-resource languages.
	2. Revealed shifts toward authoritarian framing in regional languages compared to Western influences.
	3. Identified consistent model-specific bias signatures.

**Result:** The analysis shows that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left values influenced by Western data, but display authoritarian framing variations in regional languages, revealing cultural modulation effects.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** There is an urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks due to the findings of model-specific bias signatures and language-conditioned ideological expressions.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel set of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, revealing significant performance drops due to contextual variations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a gap in current benchmarks that primarily focus on single-turn question answering, necessitating an evaluation of LLMs in multi-turn contexts.

**Method:** The authors systematically vary the volume and nature of prior context in their benchmarks and evaluate multiple conventional LLMs on these tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of novel benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue evaluation
	2. Measurement of LLM performance sensitivity to contextual variations
	3. Insights on the strategic placement of task descriptions to mitigate performance drops

**Result:** Performance drops were observed, with some models experiencing up to a 73% decrease in multi-turn interactions. Even advanced models like GPT-4o showed a 32% accuracy decline. Strategic task description placement improved accuracy significantly.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on traditional LLMs and may not capture the full spectrum of newer models.

**Conclusion:** Robust strategies are essential for designing and evaluating LLMs to address context-related sensitivities that impact performance.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks, focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude, and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable. Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to large language models (LLMs) for studying human behavior in social sciences, demonstrating their potential effectiveness and computational advantages.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for alternative models to LLMs in social science experiments where large-scale experiments are infeasible, while also addressing the computational expense of LLMs.

**Method:** Introduced interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and compared their performance against experimental simulations of LLMs that rely on feedback from other LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of interacting GMMs as a feasible alternative to LLMs for studying human interactions.
	2. Demonstration of the effectiveness of GMMs in capturing dynamics relevant to social sciences.
	3. Identification of key differences and similarities between GMMs and LLMs.

**Result:** Interacting GMMs successfully captured significant dynamics of interacting LLMs, highlighting similarities and differences in behavior between the two models.

**Limitations:** Computational constraints of GMMs in larger-scale applications need to be addressed in future research.

**Conclusion:** GMMs offer computational advantages and insights into human behavior modeling, with discussions on potential modifications and future research avenues.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Identifying refusal behaviors in LLMs is challenging, with existing methods relying on predefined templates or manual analysis. A more automated and robust approach is needed.

**Method:** COSMIC uses cosine similarity metrics to select steering directions and target layers for identifying refusal behaviors, independent of existing model output assumptions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the COSMIC framework for refusal behavior detection in LLMs
	2. Elimination of the need for predefined refusal templates or specific token assumptions
	3. Demonstration of effectiveness in adversarial and weakly aligned model scenarios

**Result:** COSMIC matches the steering performance of prior methods and effectively identifies refusal behaviors in both adversarial settings and weakly aligned models with minimal false refusals.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** COSMIC demonstrates robustness across various alignment conditions, providing a more reliable method for steering LLMs towards safer behaviors.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce \textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals, demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growing global demand for multilingual applications requires addressing the inadequacies of existing monolingual datasets for ASR systems, specifically in handling code-switching.

**Method:** The paper introduces LinguaMaster, a multi-agent collaboration framework for multilingual data synthesis, leading to the creation of SwitchLingua, a large-scale dataset with diverse linguistic and ethnic representation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LinguaMaster for data synthesis
	2. Creation of SwitchLingua dataset with 420K CS samples
	3. Proposal of Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER) for ASR evaluation

**Result:** SwitchLingua includes 420K CS textual samples and over 80 hours of audio data from 174 speakers, enhancing resources for multilingual and multicultural research.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work provides a foundational resource for future advancement in code-switching ASR and proposes SAER, an evaluation metric that improves performance assessment in code-switching scenarios.

**Abstract:** Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech (CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.   Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.   To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate \textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity, offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the \textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware assessment of system performance.

**TL;DR:** This paper examines how refusal strategies in LLMs affect user experience, finding that partial compliance is the most effective strategy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the tradeoff between safety and user experience in LLM responses to potentially harmful queries.

**Method:** Conducted a study with 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs to assess the impact of refusal strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified the impact of refusal strategies on user perception
	2. Demonstrated that partial compliance is the optimal response strategy
	3. Revealed shortcomings in the deployment of refusal strategies by LLMs and their scoring by reward models

**Result:** Partial compliance reduces negative user perceptions by over 50% compared to flat-out refusals; state-of-the-art LLMs seldom use this strategy and reward models undervalue it.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Effective AI safety mechanisms should focus on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than solely detecting user intent.

**Abstract:** Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the significant challenge of hallucination in LLMs, particularly when non-factual information appears early in outputs.

**Method:** The approach utilizes neural differential equations to model the dynamics in the latent space of LLMs, mapping sequences into the classification space for truth assessment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs) as a new method for assessing truthfulness in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of improved performance on multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art techniques
	3. Innovative use of neural differential equations to model dynamics in LLM latent spaces

**Result:** Extensive experiments showed that HD-NDEs improve AUC-ROC scores by over 14% on the True-False dataset compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HD-NDEs significantly enhance the reliability of LLM outputs by systematically assessing statement truthfulness, addressing limitations of previous techniques.

**Abstract:** In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a unified RLVR-based training paradigm to enhance large language models' (LLMs) capabilities in non-verifiable creative writing through a novel pairwise Generative Reward Model and Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization algorithm.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of subjective quality assessment in creative writing and open-ended dialogue tasks, which traditional reward models struggle with due to their reliance on limited human preferences.

**Method:** A pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) transforms subjective quality assessments into verifiable rewards, while the Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm facilitates dynamic pairwise comparisons using bootstrapped responses during RL training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a pairwise Generative Reward Model for verifiable reward generation in subjective tasks.
	2. Proposed Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization for dynamic reinforcement learning without fixed references.
	3. Demonstrated competitive performance on writing benchmarks compared to traditional reward models.

**Result:** The proposed approach, demonstrated through Writing-Zero, shows significant improvements in writing capabilities and robustness against reward hacking, outperforming scalar reward models on various writing benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed unified RLVR framework offers a comprehensive approach to reward modeling that can enhance LLM performance across a wide range of language tasks, combining rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free methodologies.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the necessity of enhancing LLM reliability in health domains through specific strategies to mitigate false positives and biases in predictions.

**Abstract:** Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

**Motivation:** To improve nursing communication training with scalable, adaptive virtual patient systems that respond effectively to trainee interactions.

**Method:** The framework constructs flexible clinical scenarios and uses a modular system to assess and adapt VP behavior based on trainee input during simulations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a dialogue generation framework for virtual patients using LLMs.
	2. Real-time adaptation of virtual patient behavior based on trainee responses.
	3. Automated assessment of communication skills validated by expert evaluation.

**Result:** Automated evaluations indicated that the communication skill assessment mirrored real-world proficiency, and expert reviews confirmed more natural interactions compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** The framework's performance may vary depending on the quality and scope of the training scenarios created.

**Conclusion:** Adaptive-VP shows promise as a scalable tool for effective nursing communication training, enhancing virtual patient interactions' realism and adaptability.

**Abstract:** Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for nursing communication training.

**Result:** The incorporation of personalized context in answers led to performance improvements of up to 39%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LaMP-QA will support future research in personalized question answering by providing a publicly available benchmark.

**Abstract:** Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences. Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to support future research in this area.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the role of emojis in offensive Twitter messages and proposes an LLM-based moderation system to mitigate their harmful effects while maintaining semantic intent.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in understanding how emojis contribute to the offensiveness of social media content, especially on platforms like Twitter where they are widely used.

**Method:** The study systematically examines the distribution of emojis in offensive tweets, analyzes their contextual meanings, and implements a multi-step LLM-powered moderation pipeline to replace harmful emojis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic analysis of emojis in offensive communication on Twitter
	2. Development of an LLM-powered moderation pipeline for emoji replacement
	3. Insights into the contextual misuse of emojis and their varied impact across offense types

**Result:** Human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness of tweets without losing their intended meanings, while revealing heterogeneous impacts across different types of offensive content.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into emoji use in online communication and contribute to developing strategies for effective moderation on social media.

**Abstract:** Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity. While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense, the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse. In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered, multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that a straightforward implementation using LLMs can lead to improved player engagement in social deduction games without the necessity of complex designs or additional tools.

**Abstract:** The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores how different refusal strategies in LLMs affect user perceptions and engagement, revealing that partial compliance is the most effective strategy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the tradeoff between LLM safety and user experience when refusing harmful queries.

**Method:** A study involving 480 participants evaluated 3,840 query-response pairs to analyze the effects of different refusal strategies on user perceptions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified the impact of refusal strategies on user perceptions in LLMs
	2. Demonstrated that partial compliance is the optimal refusal strategy
	3. Provided insights into the shortcomings of current reward models in evaluating LLM responses

**Result:** The study found that response strategy significantly impacts user experience, with partial compliance reducing negative perceptions by over 50% compared to outright refusals.

**Limitations:** The study may not encompass all types of harmful queries or user motivations outside the sample.

**Conclusion:** Effective AI safety mechanisms should prioritize thoughtful refusals over intent detection to enhance user engagement while ensuring safety.

**Abstract:** Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** radiology reports, machine learning, lightweight models, clinical decision-making, health informatics

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates lightweight models for structuring radiology reports, showing they outperform larger LLMs while being more resource-efficient.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the standardization of radiology reports for better clinical decision-making and overcome the limitations of large language models in terms of computational requirements and data privacy.

**Method:** The study benchmarks lightweight encoder-decoder models (T5 and BERT2BERT) against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B) using prefix prompting, in-context learning, and low-rank adaptation for structuring radiology reports.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the efficacy of lightweight models for clinical text structuring.
	2. Highlighted sustainability in model deployment compared to large LLMs.
	3. Provided a comprehensive benchmark of lightweight and large models in radiology report structuring.

**Result:** The best-performing lightweight model outperforms all adapted LLMs in human-annotated testing, though some adapted models achieve modest gains with much higher resource requirements.

**Limitations:** The study's findings may not generalize to non-radiology clinical texts or other languages as it primarily focused on radiology reports.

**Conclusion:** Lightweight, task-specific models provide a sustainable and privacy-preserving approach to structuring clinical text, especially in resource-constrained healthcare environments.

**Abstract:** Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning (ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

**TL;DR:** AST-FIM is a new pretraining strategy for code LLMs that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees to enhance code completion tasks by masking complete syntactic structures instead of random character spans.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing LLMs mask random character spans, which does not effectively utilize the syntactic structure of code. This can lead to incoherent training examples.

**Method:** AST-FIM uses Abstract Syntax Trees to mask complete code structures during the pretraining process, providing a more coherent context for models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AST-FIM for pretraining code LLMs
	2. Development of Real-FIM-Eval benchmark from 30,000+ GitHub commits
	3. Demonstrated performance increase of AST-FIM over traditional methods

**Result:** AST-FIM outperforms traditional random-character FIM methods by up to 5 points on standard benchmarks tailored for fill-in-the-middle programming tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AST-FIM significantly improves the performance of code LLMs on real-world code editing tasks and is validated through a comprehensive benchmark, Real-FIM-Eval.

**Abstract:** Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code LLMs, where models complete code segments given surrounding context. However, existing LLMs treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12 languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of REIC for intent classification
	2. Utilization of retrieval-augmented generation for scalability
	3. Demonstration of superior performance on real-world datasets

**Result:** REIC outperforms traditional methods such as fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

**Conclusion:** REIC demonstrates strong performance in intent classification, suitable for adaptive deployment in customer service environments.

**Abstract:** Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome limitations in existing RAG systems, which struggle with interpretability and improvement due to tightly coupled designs.

**Method:** ComposeRAG decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic modules for functions like query reformulation and answer verification, allowing for independent testing and upgrades, and includes a self-reflection mechanism to refine answers upon error verification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a modular architecture for RAG systems
	2. Significant improvements in accuracy and grounding fidelity
	3. Validation through comprehensive ablation studies

**Result:** ComposeRAG outperforms existing methods by achieving up to a 15% accuracy improvement and significantly enhances grounding, reducing ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The modular design of ComposeRAG provides a flexible and scalable approach to multi-hop reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that MedOrch enhances healthcare AI capabilities by facilitating reasoning-driven use of specialized tools for complex medical decision-making.

**Abstract:** Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover, in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical decision-making.

**Motivation:** To explore the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes medical domains, particularly for low-resource languages like Persian.

**Method:** Benchmarking over 40 state-of-the-art models including general-purpose and language-specific LLMs in various testing settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced PersianMedQA dataset for medical question answering in Persian and English.
	2. Benchmarking of over 40 LLMs in zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings.
	3. Analysis of translation impact on model performance.

**Result:** Closed-source general models performed best, with GPT-4.1 achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian, while Persian fine-tuned models significantly underperformed.

**Limitations:** Results may vary based on cultural and clinical contextual cues that are not universally applicable.

**Conclusion:** Model size is not sufficient for robust performance; domain-specific adaptation is critical. The PersianMedQA dataset offers a means to evaluate multilingual medical reasoning.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Bias Mitigation, Language Models, Implicit Bias, Racial Concepts, Fairness

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Aligned language models can inadvertently amplify implicit biases due to their lack of representation of racial concepts, necessitating a new mitigation strategy that incentivizes awareness of these concepts.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore why value-aligned language models exhibit implicit bias despite appearing unbiased in explicit evaluations.

**Method:** The authors analyze the internal representations of aligned and unaligned language models, particularly focusing on how these models handle racial concepts in ambiguous contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Discovery that alignment amplifies implicit bias in language models
	2. Proposed novel bias mitigation strategy focusing on early representations of racial concepts
	3. Insights into the mechanisms of implicit bias in language models and their internal representation handling.

**Result:** Aligned language models overlook racial concepts in early representations, failing to activate safety guardrails, which leads to increased implicit bias; new strategies for bias mitigation are proposed that encourage representation of racial concepts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Developing interventions that make models more aware of racial concepts can effectively mitigate implicit bias, avoiding the pitfalls of ignorance associated with race blindness.

**Abstract:** Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

**TL;DR:** The study investigates biases in large language models (LLMs) during candidate selection based on voluntarily disclosed demographic information, particularly focusing on disability status.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the increasing use of LLMs in hiring, there are growing concerns about fairness, particularly regarding the impact of demographic disclosures on candidate selection outcomes.

**Method:** The study compares selection outcomes of candidates with identical qualifications who either disclosed having a disability or not in various job applications with minimal employment rate gaps.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified biases in LLM candidate selection based on disability disclosure.
	2. Provided empirical evidence of the impact of demographic information on job applications.
	3. Called attention to the need for fairer LLM integration in hiring practices.

**Result:** LLMs consistently favored candidates who disclosed they had no disability over similar candidates who either disclosed a disability or chose not to disclose.

**Limitations:** The study focuses specifically on disability disclosure, which may not encompass all forms of demographic bias.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight significant biases in LLMs regarding candidates' disability status, suggesting that voluntary disclosure negatively affects selection chances for candidates with disabilities.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs, especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have a disability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing deployment of Large Language Models in critical domains necessitates a mechanism to ensure their outputs are reliable, particularly in detecting false assumptions that can lead to incorrect responses.

**Method:** A benchmark called MultiHoax was developed to assess LLMs on their ability to manage false premises through multi-step reasoning, utilizing a dataset sourced from Wikipedia across various countries and knowledge categories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark (MultiHoax) for evaluating multi-hop reasoning in LLMs.
	2. Exposure of the limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs in detecting false premises.
	3. Provision of a diverse dataset for future research on LLM reasoning capabilities.

**Result:** State-of-the-art LLMs were found to struggle with detecting false premises across different contexts and multi-hop reasoning tasks, revealing significant shortcomings in their reasoning capabilities.

**Limitations:** Limited to the contexts and categories represented in the dataset; may not cover all possible reasoning challenges.

**Conclusion:** The findings underline the urgency for enhancements in LLMs' false premise detection and their multi-hop reasoning abilities to improve accuracy in practical applications.

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly, rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson $\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

**Keywords:** continued pretraining, large language models, language adaptation, in-context learning, catastrophic forgetting

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the role of English data in continued pretraining (CPT) for large language models (LLMs) and introduces methods to enhance language adaptation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the impact of including English data in the continued pretraining of LLMs for new languages, particularly its influence on the model's capabilities in the target language.

**Method:** The authors conduct experiments to analyze the effect of English data inclusion on validation perplexity and downstream capabilities. They also introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL) and apply curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights to mitigate issues arising from the lack of English data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL).
	2. Identified the critical role of English data in continued pretraining for language adaptation.
	3. Proposed curriculum learning and EMA as methods to alleviate negative impacts of excluding English data.

**Result:** Including English data does not affect validation perplexity but is crucial for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. The study reveals catastrophic forgetting when English is excluded early on in CPT.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the inclusion of English data and may not address effects of other languages or data types comprehensively.

**Conclusion:** The findings improve understanding of how emergent abilities develop in language adaptation through CPT and suggest methods to enhance this process in future models.

**Abstract:** Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs). DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for natural language processing.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve communication for individuals unable to produce vocal speech by enabling LLMs to understand unvoiced EMG signals.

**Method:** Proposed a novel EMG adaptor module to map EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving a low word error rate (WER).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel EMG adaptor module for LLM input mapping
	2. Significant reduction in word error rate for unvoiced EMG-to-text
	3. First attempt to apply LLMs to interpret unvoiced articulatory biosignals

**Result:** Achieved an average WER of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task, improving performance by nearly 20% over specialized models with limited data.

**Limitations:** The approach is tested on limited data; further research needed for scalability.

**Conclusion:** This work is a crucial step towards enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech, showing potential for practical applications in communication aids.

**Abstract:** Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech using surface EMG.

**TL;DR:** Introduces a lossless compression technique for Large Language Models that reduces input token sequence length while retaining all semantic information.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for prompt compression focus on lossy techniques, which can lead to loss of important semantic information during compression.

**Method:** A task-agnostic lossless compression technique inspired by LZ77 is proposed, allowing for significant reduction in input token sequence length and computation requirements during encoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel lossless compression method for LLMs
	2. Demonstrates significant sequence length reduction
	3. Maintains semantic information without loss

**Result:** Achieved an average reduction of 27% and 18% in token sequence length for two tasks, leading to 47% and 33% less encoding computation, respectively.

**Limitations:** The study evaluates only two tasks; performance may vary across different types of tasks not examined here.

**Conclusion:** The proposed technique shows strong potential for preserving semantics/syntax without loss, and larger models may further compensate for the slight performance gap observed compared to uncompressed inputs.

**Abstract:** Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

**TL;DR:** This study proposes a framework for generating movie reviews using large language models (LLMs) and compares their performance against IMDb user reviews.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growing interest in applying LLMs for generating product and movie reviews.

**Method:** A framework utilizing three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0) to generate movie reviews based on input from movie subtitles and screenplays.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed framework for LLMs to generate movie reviews
	2. Comparison of three different LLMs in generating reviews
	3. Survey-based analysis on the indistinguishability of LLM-generated reviews from IMDb reviews

**Result:** LLM-generated reviews are syntactically fluent but lack emotional richness and stylistic coherence compared to IMDb reviews; DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews.

**Limitations:** Need for further refinement in emotional richness and stylistic coherence of LLM-generated reviews.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs can generate structurally complete movie reviews, improvements are needed in emotional depth and coherence.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews, suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews. We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0 captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

**Motivation:** To explore the implications of using large language models for mitigating loneliness and the potential risks associated with their use.

**Method:** Analysis of user interactions with ChatGPT, specifically dialogues classified as lonely, to identify patterns and outcomes in user responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of the inadequacies of LLMs in addressing mental health issues like loneliness.
	2. Quantification of toxic content and biases present in user interactions with LLMs.
	3. Recommendations for improving LLM applications in sensitive contexts.

**Result:** 37% of users sought advice or validation in lonely dialogues, with good engagement, but ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios like suicidal ideation, with a 35% higher incidence of toxic content.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on interactions with ChatGPT and may not generalize to other settings or models.

**Conclusion:** The use of LLMs in addressing loneliness raises ethical and legal concerns, with risks such as radicalisation and isolation; recommendations for research and industry are provided.

**Abstract:** Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide. Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22x more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations to research and industry to address loneliness.

**Result:** SkillVerse enhances in-context learning by 25% and improves prediction of model weaknesses by 22%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework provides a flexible, insightful understanding of large language models' capabilities.

**Abstract:** As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse.

**Motivation:** There is a need for improved performance in handling complex, knowledge-intensive questions with LLMs due to limitations caused by reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results.

**Method:** TreeRare employs syntax trees to guide information retrieval, generating subcomponent-based queries at each node and synthesizing relevant passages into context-aware evidence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the TreeRare framework for guided retrieval using syntax trees
	2. Improved performance on ambiguous and multi-hop reasoning tasks
	3. Demonstration of compositionality in question answering through subcomponent queries

**Result:** TreeRare shows substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework effectively resolves localized uncertainties by utilizing a structured approach to retrieval and reasoning, enhancing the accuracy of complex question answering.

**Abstract:** In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex, knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

**TL;DR:** This study explores how large language models reason about emotional states using contextual information, highlighting the challenges and limitations in emotion recognition tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to reason about emotions using covert contextual cues, moving beyond overt cues typically used in emotion recognition.

**Method:** We developed a specialized Theory-of-Mind (ToM) evaluation dataset and conducted tests on LLMs to assess their reasoning capabilities in both forward and backward contexts related to emotions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a specialized ToM evaluation dataset for emotion recognition
	2. Insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities regarding emotions
	3. Highlighting the importance of psychological theories in LLM training and evaluation

**Result:** LLMs demonstrated some reasoning abilities regarding emotional states but struggled with associating situational appraisals with specific emotions.

**Limitations:** LLMs showed poor performance in correlating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions.

**Conclusion:** There is a necessity for integrating psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs for improved emotion reasoning.

**Abstract:** Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

**Abstract:** The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license. However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across 75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the ESPnet toolkit.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper examines grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, revealing LLMs' limitations in initiating clarifications and follow-ups, and introduces a benchmark to address these issues.

**Read time:** 16 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand and improve mutual understanding in human-LLM conversations, which is crucial for effective interaction, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

**Method:** Analysis of datasets (WildChat, MultiWOZ, Bing Chat) to create a taxonomy of grounding acts, and models for annotating and predicting grounding behavior.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a taxonomy of grounding acts
	2. Introduction of the Rifts benchmark for assessing grounding issues
	3. Preliminary intervention proposed to mitigate grounding failures.

**Result:** LLMs were less likely to initiate clarifications and follow-ups compared to humans, with early grounding failures predicting interaction breakdowns.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Current LLMs need better training and prompting strategies to improve their grounding capabilities in conversations.

**Abstract:** Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on Rifts, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention aimed at mitigating grounding failures.

**Conclusion:** LSC offers a lightweight solution to enhance the clustering process in LLM outputs without the downsides of external model reliance, paving the way for better resource utilization in LLM applications.

**Abstract:** Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

**Abstract:** Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance nursing communication training by providing a scalable and adaptable solution that responds to trainees' varying skills, overcoming limitations of traditional standardized patient simulations.

**Method:** The framework employs a pipeline to create flexible VP scenarios and a modular system to assess trainee communication and modify VP responses in real time.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Adaptive-VP framework using LLMs for scalable communication training
	2. Real-time adjustment of VP responses based on trainee input
	3. Validation through expert evaluations demonstrating improved interaction realism

**Result:** Validation showed Adaptive-VP facilitates challenging patient conversations effectively, with automated evaluation correlating with real-world nursing proficiency levels and expert reviews affirming its realistic interactions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adaptive-VP presents a promising tool for nursing education, offering adaptive communication training that scales and improves learning outcomes.

**Abstract:** Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for nursing communication training.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current self-correction methods for text-to-SQL are inefficient and struggle with effective error detection, necessitating a new solution.

**Method:** SHARE utilizes a sequential pipeline of three specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) to transform SQL queries into action trajectories, followed by two-phase refinement and a hierarchical self-evolution training strategy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces SHARE, a novel hierarchical correction mechanism for text-to-SQL.
	2. Employs specialized SLMs for better error localization and correction.
	3. Demonstrates robust performance in low-resource training scenarios.

**Result:** Experimental results show that SHARE significantly improves self-correction capabilities and performs robustly across various LLMs, even in low-resource settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SHARE enhances error localization and correction, making it valuable for text-to-SQL applications, especially under data privacy constraints.

**Abstract:** Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2) LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** SRM reduces decision-making costs to 1/10 of the original search framework while maintaining effectiveness across various complex tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed SRM significantly improves efficiency and effectiveness in LLM decision-making for complex tasks.

**Abstract:** Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation. And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while maintaining effectiveness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** As large language models (LLMs) become dominant in NLP applications, the optimization of textual prompts is vital for improving model performance.

**Method:** The authors introduce the TSGD-M framework which reweights prompt sampling based on previous batch distributions, inspired by numerical gradient descent techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M)
	2. Empirical demonstration of performance trade-offs with data scaling
	3. Significant performance improvements across multiple NLP tasks with reduced variance

**Result:** TSGD-M significantly outperforms the baseline TGD methods across nine NLP tasks while also reducing computational variance compared to TGD.

**Limitations:** The study does not explore the impact of TSGD-M on tasks outside the selected nine, nor does it fully address computational limits of LLMs when using large datasets.

**Conclusion:** The proposed TSGD-M method allows for more scalable in-context learning, offering improved efficiency and effectiveness over previous approaches.

**Abstract:** As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models (LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates (or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks - TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the interdependent factors affecting children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance, introducing a causal structure discovery method and quantifying the impact of various factors.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Children's ASR performance lags behind adults due to physiological, cognitive, and extrinsic factors, which are often analyzed in isolation rather than collectively.

**Method:** Causal structure discovery is employed to understand the interdependencies among physiological, cognitive, and extrinsic factors influencing ASR errors. Causal quantification measures the impact of these factors, and the analysis is extended to fine-tuned models to assess the influence of fine-tuning on these factors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of causal structure discovery in analyzing ASR factors
	2. Quantification of interdependent impacts on ASR errors
	3. Generalizability assessment across multiple ASR systems

**Result:** Experiments with ASR models such as Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 show the generalizability of the findings, highlighting which factors are mitigated through fine-tuning and which persist.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Understanding the interdependencies of different factors provides insights into improving children's ASR performance, suggesting targeted approaches for model fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological (e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation), and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across different ASR systems.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents adaptive parallel decoding (APD) for improving the generation speed of large language models (LLMs) by dynamically adjusting token sampling in parallel, achieving higher throughput with minimal quality loss.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The bottleneck in generation speed of LLMs due to autoregressive decoding leads to a need for methods that can enhance performance without sacrificing quality.

**Method:** APD introduces a mixture approach that combines dLLM marginal probabilities with the joint probability from a small autoregressive model, optimizing through key parameters and techniques such as KV caching.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of adaptive parallel decoding (APD) for token generation.
	2. Demonstration of improved throughput with minimal quality loss.
	3. Optimal tradeoff parameters for performance tuning.

**Result:** APD significantly improves throughput on downstream tasks while maintaining nearly the same level of quality as autoregressive models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** APD offers a flexible solution for balancing throughput and quality in token generation for LLMs, with three adjustable parameters to optimize performance.

**Abstract:** The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding, where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing methods in detecting noisy annotations in context learning due to the breakdown of assumptions related to perplexity in the presence of high noise ratios.

**Method:** The authors propose a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to correct perplexity estimates, leading to the development of a Sample Cleanliness Score.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dual debiasing framework for noise detection
	2. Development of a robust Sample Cleanliness Score
	3. Demonstrated superior noise detection capabilities compared to existing methods

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that the proposed method offers superior noise detection capabilities and allows for ICL performance comparable to that of a clean demonstration corpus, even under high noise conditions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dual debiasing framework and the Sample Cleanliness Score provide a reliable mechanism for uncovering absolute sample cleanliness in noisy annotated corpora.

**Abstract:** In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are extremely high.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the integration of multimodality in chatbots by considering both visual and auditory aspects for more immersive interactions.

**Method:** A novel multimodal conversation model is proposed, trained on a new dataset called Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), which allows for processing of dynamic, real-world-like conversations with multiple speakers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the $M^3C$ dataset for multimodal conversations
	2. Development of a novel multimodal conversation model with memory retrieval capabilities
	3. Demonstrated strong performance in dynamic human-like interactions using visual and auditory inputs.

**Result:** The model shows strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions during multimodal conversations, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents capable of realistic, immersive interactions with humans.

**Abstract:** As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

**Motivation:** To improve automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases and to address the slow inference speed of dynamic vocabulary in autoregressive models.

**Method:** DYNAC proposes a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers of the model, allowing the encoder to effectively capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DYNAC for integrating dynamic vocabulary in non-autoregressive models
	2. Demonstration of significant improvement in inference speed
	3. Reduction in real-time factor while maintaining accuracy in speech recognition tasks

**Result:** DYNAC achieves an 81% reduction in real-time factor with only a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed DYNAC method enhances the performance of non-autoregressive models for speech recognition tasks by effectively utilizing dynamic vocabulary, achieving faster inference without significantly compromising accuracy.

**Abstract:** Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models. This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens. This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents RI²VER, a multi-answer QA framework addressing challenges in retrieving and synthesizing multiple evidence passages to improve answer accuracy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current retrieval-augmented QA systems struggle with generating multi-answer responses due to difficulties in managing and synthesizing numerous evidence passages.

**Method:** The proposed framework retrieves multiple passages and initially generates a noisy answer set which is refined through an inter-passage verification process involving question generation, evidence gathering, and synthesis verification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the RI²VER framework for multi-answer QA.
	2. Development of an inter-passage verification pipeline to enhance answer accuracy.
	3. Empirical validation showing significant performance gains over existing baselines.

**Result:** RI²VER shows significant performance improvements over existing methods, with an average F1 score increase of 11.17% on the QAMPARI and RoMQA datasets.

**Limitations:** The framework may depend heavily on the quality of retrieved passages and could struggle with overly complex queries beyond its designed scope.

**Conclusion:** The inter-passage verification approach enhances the framework's ability to synthesize multiple pieces of evidence effectively, making it valuable for complex multi-answer questions.

**Abstract:** Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1) Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3) Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) for forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) that enhances the generalization abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by disentangling general patterns and scenario information.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the forecasting capabilities of LLMs on Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) by improving model generalization through a novel learning framework.

**Method:** The proposed G2S framework consists of two stages: general learning, where scenario information is masked to focus on capturing general patterns, and specific learning, where scenario information is reintroduced to refine predictions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the G2S framework for TKG forecasting
	2. Disentanglement of general patterns and scenario-specific information
	3. Demonstration of improved generalization capabilities of LLMs

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that G2S significantly improves the generalization abilities of LLMs in forecasting tasks over TKGs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The G2S framework successfully disentangles general and specific knowledge, leading to better performance in TKG forecasts.

**Abstract:** Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models' generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

**Keywords:** hallucinations, large language models, medical summarization, detection methods, fact-based approaches

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates hallucination detection methods specifically in the medical domain, showing that existing general-domain detectors are ineffective and presenting new fact-based approaches to improve detection accuracy in clinical summarization by using specialized metrics and expert-annotated datasets.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the risks posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during patient-clinician dialogue summarization, which can affect patient care and clinical decision-making.

**Method:** The authors constructed two datasets for their analysis: one induced hallucinations by removing facts from source dialogues (fact-controlled) and another that included naturally occurring hallucinations during LLM summarization. They evaluated existing detection methods and developed their own fact-based approaches.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of hallucination detection methods in the medical domain
	2. Creation of two specific datasets for studying hallucinations
	3. Development of explainable, fact-based hallucination detection approaches

**Result:** The analysis revealed that general-domain hallucination detectors perform poorly in detecting clinical hallucinations, and the performance on fact-controlled scenarios does not accurately predict efficacy on natural scenarios. Their new LLM-based detectors showed good generalization to real-world clinical hallucinations.

**Limitations:** The rarity and randomness of hallucinations can complicate comprehensive investigations, and the generalization of findings to all clinical contexts may require further validation.

**Conclusion:** The research provides a framework for improving the detection of hallucinations in clinical summarization, enhancing the reliability of LLMs in medical applications through specialized metrics and datasets.

**Abstract:** Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods. Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical summarization systems.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates a critical design decision in the practice of massively multilingual continual pre-training -- the inclusion of parallel data. Specifically, we study the impact of bilingual translation data for massively multilingual language adaptation of the Llama3 family of models to 500 languages. To this end, we construct the MaLA bilingual translation corpus, containing data from more than 2,500 language pairs. Subsequently, we develop the EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite of four massively multilingual models -- continually pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7 tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We open-source the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite artefacts, code, and model generations.

**Conclusion:** The PVP dataset facilitates advancements in personalized visual persuasion and provides insights for further research in this area.

**Abstract:** Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized visual persuasion.

**Motivation:** To improve fake news detection by effectively integrating LLM-generated pseudo labels, which traditionally perform poorly on their own compared to traditional methods.

**Method:** The paper proposes a Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) that uses label propagation techniques to enhance prediction accuracy by utilizing pseudo labels generated by LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel GLPN-LLM framework for fake news detection.
	2. Integration of LLMs via label propagation techniques.
	3. Design of a mask-based mechanism to prevent label leakage.

**Result:** The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GLPN-LLM model achieves better performance compared to existing state-of-the-art detection methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By synergizing LLMs with label propagation techniques, the GLPN-LLM model significantly enhances the accuracy of multimodal fake news detection.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of selecting optimal in-context examples for machine translation in low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce.

**Method:** DAT generates example pairs based on criteria of relevance and diversity, and it explores progressively accumulating generated pairs during test time to enhance translation performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DAT for generating in-context examples without external resources.
	2. Demonstration of improved translation performance in low-resource languages.
	3. Exploration of accumulating generated pairs during test time to optimize translation quality.

**Result:** Experiments show that DAT yields superior translation quality compared to baselines in low-resource settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates that effectively generating in-context examples can significantly improve machine translation outcomes for low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have demonstrated strong advantages in addressing complex real-world tasks. However, due to the introduction of additional attack surfaces, MASs are particularly vulnerable to misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows. Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and improving task success rates under attack by approximately 10.33%.

**Motivation:** To identify the most effective evaluation metrics for measuring diversity in commonsense generation, as prior metrics tend to overestimate diversity.

**Method:** Conduct a meta-evaluation of existing diversity metrics using a newly created dataset annotated for sentence diversity, comparing form-based and content-based metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic meta-evaluation of commonsense generation diversity metrics.
	2. Creation of a novel LLM-annotated dataset for diversity assessment.
	3. Demonstration that content-based metrics are superior to form-based metrics.

**Result:** Content-based diversity metrics consistently outperformed form-based metrics and showed high correlations with LLM-generated diversity ratings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Future commonsense generation research should prioritize content-based evaluation metrics for diversity.

**Abstract:** In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of their outputs.

**Method:** CausalAbstain is a causal approach that helps LLMs determine how to utilize and identify useful generated feedback responses for abstention.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the CausalAbstain method for feedback selection in multilingual LLM settings.
	2. Demonstrates improved abstention decisions in LLMs using extensive experiments.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that CausalAbstain selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions in both native and multilingual settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CausalAbstain improves interpretability and effectiveness of LLM abstention methods by leveraging causal relationships in feedback selection.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings. Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language (\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic and commonsense knowledge QA tasks.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

	1. Introduction of the DecKER framework for decoupled knowledge editing
	2. Demonstrated improvement in multi-hop reasoning tasks
	3. Code availability for further research and implementation

**Result:** DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods in multi-hop QA benchmarks, by reducing knowledge conflicts and maintaining reasoning consistency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The DecKER framework enhances the knowledge editing process in LLMs and shows promising results in improving reasoning paths for complex tasks.

**Abstract:** Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, reinforcement learning, reward aggregation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes ARIA, a method for reducing reward variance in reinforcement learning for large language models by projecting actions into a low-dimensional intention space.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models struggle with sparse rewards in open-ended tasks, resulting in high variance during reinforcement learning.

**Method:** ARIA aggregates rewards in intention space, projecting natural language actions from a high-dimensional joint token distribution into a low-dimensional intention space for better clustering and reward assignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ARIA for reward aggregation in intention space
	2. Significant reduction in reward variance
	3. Improvement in task performance across various benchmarks

**Result:** ARIA reduces policy gradient variance and improves performance by an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks compared to existing RL baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The method demonstrates effective training of language agents by ensuring more robust reward signals, leading to improved policy optimization.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

**Motivation:** Existing text summarization evaluation frameworks are limited by domain specificity, language coverage, and the complexity of human annotation.

**Method:** MSumBench integrates specialized criteria for different domains and employs a multi-agent debate system to improve the quality of annotations while evaluating several summarization models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-dimensional and multi-domain evaluation framework for summarization
	2. Incorporation of specialized assessment criteria tailored to different domains
	3. Use of a multi-agent debate system to improve annotation quality

**Result:** Distinct performance patterns were found across domains and languages, and biases in large language models were identified regarding their evaluation of summaries they self-generate.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The benchmark dataset aims to enhance the quality of summarization evaluations and is made publicly available for further research.

**Abstract:** Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/MSumBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the realism of seeker simulation in AI-driven mental health applications while addressing ethical concerns of using real seekers.

**Method:** AnnaAgent employs an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor, trained on authentic counseling dialogues, integrating a tertiary memory mechanism for dynamic control across sessions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of AnnaAgent with a dynamic emotional and cognitive framework
	2. Implementation of tertiary memory for better multi-session continuity
	3. Use of real counseling dialogues for training the agent's response behavior

**Result:** Evaluation results show that AnnaAgent provides a more realistic simulation of seekers during psychological counseling than existing baseline models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AnnaAgent represents a significant advancement in emotional and cognitive simulation for AI-driven mental health interfaces, improving multi-session interaction realism.

**Abstract:** Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to fill the gap in existing research on the impact of emojis in online communication and their potential to convey harmful meanings.

**Method:** A systematic examination of emoji contributions to offensive messages on Twitter, analyzing distribution across offense categories and the exploitation of emoji ambiguity; development of a multi-step moderation pipeline using LLMs to replace harmful emojis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic study of emojis in offensive communication on social media
	2. Proposal of a multi-step LLM-powered moderation pipeline
	3. Insights into the contextual misuse of emojis in conveying offense

**Result:** Human evaluations show that the proposed moderation approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness of tweets while maintaining their semantic intent.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on Twitter and may not generalize to other platforms or forms of communication.

**Conclusion:** The paper provides nuanced insights into emoji moderation and highlights varied effects across different types of offensive content.

**Abstract:** Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity. While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense, the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse. In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered, multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current retriever models assume that knowledge pieces are conditionally independent, which may limit their effectiveness in knowledge-grounded dialog systems.

**Method:** Entriever models the candidate retrieval results as a whole using an energy function to define relevance scores, exploring various architectures and training methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an energy-based retriever that models knowledge pieces collectively.
	2. Demonstration of superior performance in knowledge retrieval tasks compared to existing models.
	3. Enhancement of end-to-end performance in dialog systems during semi-supervised training.

**Result:** Entriever significantly outperforms a strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks and improves end-to-end performance in semi-supervised training of dialog systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Entriever provides a more effective approach to knowledge retrieval in dialog systems by collectively scoring relevant knowledge pieces.

**Abstract:** A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems, when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Fully open-source framework for contract analysis
	2. Integration of multi-agent workflows for collaboration
	3. Novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component for enhanced legal document review

**Result:** PAKTON outperforms other models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as demonstrated through human evaluation and metrics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PAKTON provides an accessible and efficient solution for legal document review while ensuring privacy due to its open-source nature.

**Abstract:** Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts. Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

**Motivation:** To improve the evaluation benchmarks for clinical tasks like diagnosis and treatment by assessing the decision-making abilities of LLMs.

**Method:** The study employs a knowledge graph-based approach to generate distractors that are clinically plausible but misleading, using multi-step semantic walks on medical knowledge graphs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the KGGDG framework for generating misleading distractors in clinical MCQs.
	2. Demonstration of its effectiveness across six medical QA benchmarks.
	3. Highlighting the potential of knowledge graphs in improving the robustness of LLM evaluations.

**Result:** The KGGDG framework was applied to six medical QA benchmarks, successfully reducing the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs, indicating the need for more robust evaluation methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The KGGDG approach is established as an effective tool for enhancing the rigor of evaluations of medical language models, providing more realistic tests of their performance in clinical decision-making tasks.

**Abstract:** Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation (KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic evaluations of medical LLMs.

**TL;DR:** CombiSearch improves dialogue state tracking (DST) by using a retriever that scores in-context examples, addressing key limitations in existing methods.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for training retrievers in dialogue state tracking fail to optimize for DST performance due to the lack of consideration for synergistic effects, linguistic characteristics, and performance-focused scoring.

**Method:** CombiSearch scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance to improve example retrieval.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces CombiSearch for effective example scoring in DST
	2. Demonstrates 20x data efficiency improvement
	3. Achieves 12% performance improvement over traditional methods

**Result:** Retrievers trained with CombiSearch exceeded state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and showing robustness on the SGD dataset, alongside a 12% absolute improvement in upper bound DST performance over traditional methods without retrieval errors.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CombiSearch significantly enhances practical DST performance by addressing shortcomings in existing data-driven retriever training methods.

**Abstract:** In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the performance decline of language identification (LID) models on accented speech and proposes methods to enhance their robustness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The decline in LID model performance on accented speech is not well understood, prompting investigation into the causes and potential solutions.

**Method:** The study identifies common misclassifications by LID systems on L2 accented speech and introduces a method for input chunking to improve model robustness, along with an approach that integrates sequence-level information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of misclassification of accented speech by LID models
	2. Introduction of input chunking to improve robustness against accents
	3. Development of a sequence-level information integration approach

**Result:** The proposed methods reduce accent-language confusion and significantly improve performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Enhancing LID systems to better handle accented speech is feasible through input chunking and sequence-level information integration, which can improve accuracy without sacrificing performance on non-accented speech.

**Abstract:** Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking. (iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Use of NLP to analyze urban rental listings
	2. Identification of conflicting neighborhood designations
	3. Insights into spatially-dependent amenity emphasis

**Result:** Identified three distinct patterns in how listings characterize neighborhoods, revealing conflicts between institutional boundaries and actual neighborhood claims, as well as variations in emphasized amenities based on spatial positioning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** NLP techniques provide insights into contested definitions of urban spaces that traditional analysis methods may overlook.

**Abstract:** Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood. Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions, border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

**Abstract:** Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA (Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection (TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for future research in speech content moderation.

**Motivation:** To overcome the issue of poorly calibrated confidence scores in text generation models, which can lead to the generation of incorrect or dangerous outputs.

**Method:** The authors propose confidence metrics that are task-agnostic, relying solely on the output probabilities of the model without the need for additional fine-tuning or heuristics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of task-agnostic confidence metrics for text generation.
	2. Improved calibration of existing models such as BART and Flan-T5.
	3. No requirement for additional fine-tuning or heuristics to apply these metrics.

**Result:** The proposed metrics improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 models when evaluated on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By utilizing these confidence metrics, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to achieve better calibrated predictions in text generation tasks, enhancing overall model utility.

**Abstract:** Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

**Motivation:** There is an increasing need to evaluate large language models on their ability to identify all correct answers in multi-answer tasks, which is currently underexplored.

**Method:** The authors conducted an evaluation of 27 models on SATA questions across various domains and proposed a new decoding strategy called Choice Funnel, which combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SATA-BENCH, a new benchmark for multi-answer evaluation
	2. Development of Choice Funnel decoding strategy that improves exact match scores
	3. Documentation of performance gaps in existing LLMs on multi-answer tasks

**Result:** The evaluation revealed that existing models perform poorly, achieving only 41.8% exact match, with the proposed Choice Funnel improving this by up to 29% and reducing inference cost by over 64%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLMs and provide a new framework for enhancing multi-answer reasoning skills in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

**Abstract:** Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific, requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data, and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it.

**Conclusion:** Emotion-based prompting proves to enhance the classification and generation of sarcasm in large language models significantly.

**Abstract:** Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.

We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM capability.

*Li Zhang, Morgan Gray, Jaromir Savelka, Kevin D. Ashley*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, legal argument generation, abstention, hallucination, factor utilization

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an automated pipeline to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating legal arguments, focusing on issues of hallucination, factor utilization, and abstention.

**Read time:** 11 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The reliability of LLMs in legal tasks is critical, and existing human evaluations revealed performance gaps that require an automated assessment method.

**Method:** An automated pipeline uses an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments, comparing them to ground-truth factors in case materials across three tests of varying complexity.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an automated evaluation pipeline for LLMs in legal argument generation
	2. Empirical findings on LLMs' hallucination, factor utilization, and abstention in legal contexts
	3. Identification of critical gaps in current LLM capabilities for legal applications

**Result:** While LLMs showed over 90% accuracy in avoiding hallucinations, they struggled with utilizing relevant case factors and failed on the abstention test, generating inappropriate arguments instead of adhering to instructions.

**Limitations:** LLMs often generated irrelevant arguments despite clear instructions to abstain when no factual basis was present.

**Conclusion:** The findings stress the necessity for enhancements in factor utilization and abstention capabilities of LLMs before they can be reliably used in legal contexts.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

**TL;DR:** A framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG), enriching them with metadata and enabling detection of undercut attacks and reasoning tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the understanding and analysis of argumentative texts by transforming them into a more visually interpretable structure while facilitating reasoning tasks.

**Method:** The framework begins with basic annotations of argumentative components and relations, constructs a knowledge base graph, applies inference rules like modus ponens, and identifies missing rules to form an argument knowledge graph.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a framework for generating argument knowledge graphs from texts
	2. Identification of previously undetectable undercut attacks
	3. Enhanced reasoning tasks through enriched argument structures

**Result:** The AKG enables easier interpretation of argumentative structures, identifies previously undetectable undercut attacks, and positions the framework for future reasoning tasks such as coherence checking.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed AKG format enhances reasoning models' ability to learn implicit indirect relations over arguments, supporting improved inference-related tasks.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing end-to-end spoken dialogue systems that require large datasets and often generate semantically incoherent responses.

**Method:** The authors introduce a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation that aligns training with the pre-training tasks of multimodal language models, including ASR, TTS, and text LM tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation for training E2E spoken dialogue systems.
	2. Demonstrated training efficacy on 300 hours of data with significant performance improvements.
	3. Public release of models and training code.

**Result:** The proposed method achieved over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement compared to baselines when trained on 300 hours of conversation data, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach allows for effective training of spoken dialogue systems with much less data while maintaining semantic coherence, and the models will be made publicly available.

**Abstract:** Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information, making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model (LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A gradient-based fine-tuning framework effectively leverages large language models' representational power, ensuring training stability while minimizing reliance on large labeled datasets.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks, the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy, gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular, the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

**Conclusion:** The approach demonstrates the generalizability of the framework across domains, providing insights into narrative framing's role in public discourse.

**Abstract:** Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

**Motivation:** To improve the generation of synthetic evaluation data and meet quantitative evaluation objectives for LLM performance assessment.

**Method:** The method uses particle swarm optimization to train a swarm of data generators, optimizing them based on evaluation objectives and later extending this to Adversarial Swarms for dynamic co-evolution of data generators and test models.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Data Swarms outperform eight existing data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while Adversarial Swarms improve robustness in learning from synthetic data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods effectively optimize multiple evaluation objectives and demonstrate generalization capabilities with previously unseen LLMs.

**Abstract:** We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation (e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms, where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

**Conclusion:** The method presents a viable solution for adapting LLMs in distributed environments, efficiently mitigating challenges in Federated Learning while preserving model accuracy.

**Abstract:** Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited.

In this paper, we propose an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups, XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of 3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of gender bias and logical coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages.

**Method:** The study introduces the TWC dataset, consisting of 3,950 scenarios, and analyzes translation models like GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate to assess their performance and biases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the TWC dataset for assessing gender bias in translation
	2. Demonstration of significant biases in major translation models
	3. Improvement of mBART-50 performance through fine-tuning on the TWC dataset

**Result:** Analysis shows all models favored masculine pronouns, with Google Translate and GPT-4 exhibiting significant gender bias. Fine-tuning mBART-50 on the TWC dataset improved bias and generalization.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to mitigate gender bias in machine translation systems for genderless languages, contributing to more equitable translations.

**Abstract:** Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian, Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset, comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate, reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source. This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages, contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Cross-Lingual Privacy, Privacy Leakage, Neurons, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the risk of privacy leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs) during cross-lingual interactions and proposes deactivating specific neurons to mitigate this risk.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the risk of privacy leakage in LLMs when trained and queried in different languages, extending prior findings that assumed English-only contexts.

**Method:** The authors analyze the information flow in LLMs to understand how private data is processed across layers, identifying privacy-universal and language-specific privacy neurons and evaluating their impact on cross-lingual privacy leakage.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of privacy-universal and language-specific privacy neurons
	2. Analysis of information flow related to privacy leakage in LLMs
	3. Demonstration of risk reduction methods for cross-lingual queries

**Result:** Deactivating identified neurons can reduce the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk by 23.3%-31.6%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of considering cross-lingual contexts in LLM privacy mechanisms and offers a potential solution to mitigate the risk.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information (PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the (sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons. Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced by 23.3%-31.6%.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long texts for large language models (LLMs) to enhance comprehension and accuracy in question-answering tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models face challenges in reading and understanding extremely long texts due to fixed-length chunking methods that often split semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity.

**Method:** The authors propose a method that computes semantic similarities between sentences to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. A question-aware classifier is trained to select sensitive chunks critical for answering questions.

**Key Contributions:**

	3. Demonstrated effectiveness on multiple question-answering benchmarks

**Result:** The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baseline methods on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, maintaining robustness across various input lengths, including sequences of up to 256k tokens.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach significantly improves LLMs' performance on long text comprehension, facilitating better question-answering capabilities without losing important semantic information.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Biomedical Relation Extraction, Evaluation Methods

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the use of LLMs as evaluators for biomedical relation extraction, revealing that traditional automatic evaluation is unreliable and human evaluation is impractical, with proposed improvements for LLM-based judges.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Evaluating LLMs in biomedical relation extraction is challenging due to their ability to produce varied outputs like synonyms, making traditional metrics unreliable.

**Method:** The paper benchmarks 8 LLMs as judges evaluating outputs from 5 other LLMs on 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets, proposing structured output formatting and domain adaptation techniques to enhance evaluation accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces LLMs-as-the-Judge for evaluating biomedical relation extraction.
	2. Proposes structured output formatting to enhance evaluation accuracy.
	3. Presents a domain adaptation technique for better knowledge transfer between datasets.

**Result:** LLM-based judges generally perform poorly (below 50% accuracy), primarily because extracted relations do not adhere to standard formats. Proposed structured formatting improves accuracy by about 15%.

**Limitations:** LLM judges performed below expected accuracy rates, indicating limitations in current evaluation methods for biomedical relations.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as evaluators and suggest methods for improving their evaluation capabilities in biomedical tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets. We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k samples in total) for public use here: https://github.com/tahmedge/llm_judge_biomedical_re.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Addresses limitations of LLMs in complex reasoning due to lack of explainability and trustworthiness, which lead to hallucinations and unattributable reasoning.

**Method:** KG-TRACES supervises models to predict symbolic relation paths, full triple-level reasoning paths, and generates attribution-aware reasoning processes, adapting to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of KG-TRACES for enhanced LLM explainability
	2. Demonstrated improvements in complex reasoning tasks
	3. Transferability to specialized domains like medicine.

**Result:** KG-TRACES improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and Hits@1 by 4.8% and F1 by 2.1% on CWQ, demonstrating effective reasoning in specialized domains like medicine.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework enhances LLM performance by promoting explainable and source-attributable reasoning, with visualizations indicating more stable reasoning processes.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The goal is to improve cultural competence in language technologies, which often lack engagement with the communities they represent.

**Method:** The study involves interviews with interdisciplinary researchers to develop a framework of cultural norms and operationalizing these through computational metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a framework for cultural norms across research cultures
	2. Creation of computational metrics to measure cultural competence
	3. Insights into the homogenizing effects of LLMs on writing

**Result:** The research identifies latent cultural norms in human-written research papers and reveals the limitations of LLMs in terms of cultural competence.

**Limitations:** The study is focused solely on research cultures, which may not generalize to other cultural contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a human-centered method for analyzing cultural norms in both human-generated and LLM-generated texts.

**Abstract:** Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture, research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural, stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures. We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in human-written and LLM-generated texts.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation, robustness evaluation, knowledge graph, resilience metrics, dynamic corpus

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Retrieval-Aware Robustness Evaluation (RARE) framework, designed to assess the robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems against real-world noise and query perturbations, using a large-scale benchmark.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for better evaluation methods for RAG systems to withstand real-world challenges, including conflicting contexts and fast-changing facts.

**Method:** RARE uses a knowledge-graph-driven synthesis pipeline to automatically generate question sets and extract relations from documents in a dynamic corpus. It establishes robustness metrics to quantify model resilience against perturbations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the RARE framework for robustness evaluation of RAG systems.
	2. Creation of the RARE-Set dataset with evolving questions and domains.
	3. Formalization of retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met).

**Result:** The study finds that RAG systems are vulnerable to perturbations, particularly demonstrating lower robustness on multi-hop queries compared to single-hop queries, revealing document robustness as a significant weakness.

**Limitations:** The evaluation is focused on finance, economics, and policy documents, potentially limiting generalizability across other domains.

**Conclusion:** The RARE framework provides a comprehensive method for evaluating the robustness of RAG systems, highlighting areas for improvement in handling dynamic and noisy environments.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset (RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces FOCUS, a method that improves Visual Question Answering in multimodal large language models by focusing on key visual elements and adapting reasoning strategies based on question complexity.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current multimodal language models face challenges in complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering due to indiscriminate annotation of visual elements, leading to degraded performance.

**Method:** FOCUS dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions by combining intuitive judgments with analytical reasoning, utilizing zero-shot reasoning for simple questions and a conceptualizing strategy for complex ones.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the FOCUS method for VQA
	2. Demonstration of significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks
	3. Validation of cognitive strategy integration in multimodal reasoning

**Result:** Extensive testing on four benchmarks shows that FOCUS significantly enhances performance in Visual Question Answering for both open-source and black-box multimodal language models across all datasets tested.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information is essential for improving reasoning capabilities in visual-context tasks.

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will be released.

**Motivation:** To evaluate VLMs' ability to model human creativity in a noisy and pluralistic setting using data from a multiplayer Minecraft game.

**Method:** Curated 1500 gameplay images and designed 2000 problems involving various image settings and natural language hints; evaluated six VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces GuessBench for VLM evaluation in creativity
	2. Highlights performance disparities between model types
	3. Shows effectiveness of fine-tuning using reasoning traces

**Result:** VLMs, including GPT-4o, made mistakes in 34% of tasks, highlighting a significant gap in performance between open and API models (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average); fine-tuning improved visual tasks by 15.36%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** VLM performance in creativity correlates with training data diversity, particularly affected by underrepresentation of cultural contexts and low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings, natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling: even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by 15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data, while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural contexts and low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate whether LLMs can be effectively adapted for producing structured poetic forms in a low-resource language like Sanskrit, particularly given the advancements in high-resource languages.

**Method:** Introduced a dataset for translating English prose into Sanskrit verse while adhering to classical metrical patterns; evaluated various generative models with a focus on constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a dataset for structured poetic generation in Sanskrit
	2. Demonstration of high accuracy using constrained decoding
	3. Insights into instruction-based fine-tuning for poetic fidelity

**Result:** Achieved over 99% accuracy in creating syntactically valid poetic forms, outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Instruction-tuned models demonstrated better alignment with source meaning and poetic style, despite some trade-offs in metrical precision.

**Limitations:** The study indicates marginal trade-offs in metrical precision with instruction-tuned models.

**Conclusion:** Constrained decoding and instruction tuning are effective strategies for enhancing LLMs' ability to generate structured poetry in low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition. However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit? In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically, we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over 99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile, instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal trade-offs in metrical precision.

**Motivation:** Existing knowledge editing methods focus mainly on single models, making it challenging to update multiple models or adapt to new ones effectively.

**Method:** OnceEdit employs a plug-in model as the editing module and introduces a dynamic weight mechanism and an ensemble enhancement mechanism to improve editing efficiency and adaptability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel ensemble-based approach for knowledge editing
	2. Dynamic weight mechanism to distinguish instance relevance
	3. Ensemble enhancement mechanism to reduce reliance on central models

**Result:** Experiments show that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing knowledge editing methods while being adaptable and stable in multi-model editing scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** OnceEdit provides a robust solution for knowledge updates in large language models, enhancing editing efficiency across ensembles while addressing the limitations of reliance on central models.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will be available.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the concept of 'truth direction' in large language models, examining its consistency, identification methods, and generalization across contexts.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs often output confident inaccuracies, prompting the need to understand and potentially enhance the truthfulness of their responses.

**Method:** The authors investigate whether LLMs consistently exhibit truth directions and whether probing techniques can effectively identify these directions across various contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of truth direction consistency in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of effective truthfulness probes across multiple contexts
	3. Practical applications for enhancing user trust in LLM outputs

**Result:** The study finds that not all LLMs have consistent truth directions, with stronger models showing better representations. Probes trained on simple statements generalize well across various tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into LLM representations of truthfulness and suggest practical applications that could improve trust in LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal, knowledge graphs, generative models, graph completion, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** HERGC is a framework for multimodal knowledge graph completion that integrates diverse modalities and utilizes a generative LLM for accurate inference.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the intrinsic incompleteness of multimodal knowledge graphs by applying generative techniques that can enhance reasoning in knowledge graph completion tasks.

**Method:** HERGC deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever to enrich and fuse multimodal information, followed by a Generative LLM Predictor that identifies correct answers from a set of retrieved candidates.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HERGC framework for MMKGC
	2. Utilization of large language models in a multimodal context
	3. Achievement of state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets

**Result:** HERGC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multimodal knowledge graph completion on three standard benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The effectiveness and robustness of HERGC indicate substantial improvements in multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks through the use of generative modeling techniques.

**Abstract:** Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

**Keywords:** Knowledge Editing, Large Language Models, Benchmarking, Complex Question Answering, Model Evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces COMPKE, a benchmark for evaluating knowledge editing in language models using complex real-life scenarios.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks fail to assess how effectively large language models apply updated knowledge in practical situations, especially when reasoning is complex.

**Method:** Introduction of the COMPKE benchmark, featuring 11,924 complex questions, and evaluation of four knowledge editing methods across different language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the COMPKE benchmark for complex question answering under knowledge editing.
	2. Extensive evaluation showing the variability of knowledge editing methods across different models.
	3. Identification of methodological and model-specific causes for performance disparities.

**Result:** Variability in effectiveness of knowledge editing methods: MeLLo scores 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI but only 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B, demonstrating model-specific performance differences.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not cover all possible real-life scenarios and its applicability to all language models needs further verification.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for more nuanced evaluation of knowledge editing in language models, urging further exploration of method and model-specific outcomes.

**Abstract:** Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at https://github.com/kzjkzj666/CompKE.

**TL;DR:** CoRE framework improves LLM performance on structured data tasks by enhancing generalization through contrastive learning and experience memory.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle with structured data due to limited pre-training exposure and ineffective transfer mechanisms, necessitating better approaches for knowledge transfer.

**Method:** The CoRE framework employs contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to create experience memory representations, simulating human-like knowledge transfer to enhance LLMs' capabilities with structured data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoRE framework for structured data tasks
	2. Significant performance improvements on Text-to-SQL and TableQA
	3. Expansion of training data diversity through MCTS-generated Experience Memory

**Result:** CoRE significantly improves LLM performance on Text-to-SQL and TableQA tasks, yielding average performance gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with some challenging tasks showing up to 17.2% improvement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The CoRE framework provides a training-free, continual method to boost LLMs' proficiency with structured knowledge by enhancing diversity and domain coverage through expanded experience memory.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

**Motivation:** To address the gap in EEG-to-text generation specifically tailored for Chinese, facilitating the development of brain-computer interfaces.

**Method:** Utilizes a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), applying masked pretraining and contrastive learning for mapping EEG signals to text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced EEG2TEXT-CN, the first open-vocabulary EEG-to-text framework for Chinese.
	2. Developed a method for segmenting EEG into per-character embeddings for text prediction.
	3. Provided a foundational study for multilingual brain-to-text research.

**Result:** Achieved a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38% on a dataset of Chinese sentences aligned with EEG recordings, indicating promising lexical alignment despite challenges in syntactic fluency.

**Limitations:** Syntactic fluency remains a challenge and the BLEU-1 score indicates limited performance.

**Conclusion:** This research demonstrates the feasibility of cross-modal language decoding from EEG and lays the groundwork for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

**Abstract:** We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the advantages of bidirectional language models over unidirectional ones through the Information Bottleneck principle, proposing a method called FlowNIB for estimating mutual information during training.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Theoretical understanding of why bidirectional language models outperform unidirectional models in natural language understanding tasks remains unclear.

**Method:** FlowNIB, a dynamic and scalable method for estimating mutual information during training, addressing limitations of classical Information Bottleneck approaches.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FlowNIB for mutual information estimation
	2. Theoretical proof of superior information retention in bidirectional models
	3. Generalized framework for measuring representational complexity

**Result:** Bidirectional models demonstrate higher mutual information retention and effective dimensionality than unidirectional models, validated through extensive experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Bidirectional architectures are strictly more informative and the FlowNIB method provides a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language models.

**Abstract:** Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language models.

**TL;DR:** L3Cube-MahaEmotions is a high-quality dataset for emotion recognition in Marathi with synthetic annotation from LLMs and a benchmark for model evaluation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of emotion recognition in low-resource languages by providing a high-quality dataset and evaluating model performance.

**Method:** The dataset was created by synthetically annotating training data using large language models, with validation and test sets manually labeled. The Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) technique was applied for emotion labeling, and models were evaluated against standard metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of L3Cube-MahaEmotions dataset for Marathi
	2. Demonstration of Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) for emotion labeling
	3. Showcasing superiority of GPT-4 over BERT in low-resource emotion tasks

**Result:** GPT-4 annotations yielded better label quality compared to fine-tuned BERT models. GPT-4 also outperformed BERT-based models on the task.

**Limitations:** Focus on a specific language (Marathi) may limit applicability for broader language tasks.

**Conclusion:** High-quality human-labeled data is critical for performance in complex emotion recognition, and generic LLMs like GPT-4 outperform fine-tuned models in low-resource scenarios.

**Abstract:** Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Vision-Language Models, Causal Reasoning, Benchmarks, Fine-tuning Strategies, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces two benchmarks, VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, to evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs), revealing their limitations in this area despite strong performance in object and activity recognition.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which are often not evaluated properly due to existing benchmarks allowing for shortcuts in reasoning tasks.

**Method:** The authors introduce new benchmarks (VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal) specifically designed to test causal reasoning in VLMs, along with analysis of training dataset limitations and fine-tuning strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal benchmarks for causal reasoning evaluation in VLMs
	2. Analysis revealing poor causal reasoning skills in VLMs
	3. Exploration of fine-tuning strategies to better VLMs' causal reasoning abilities

**Result:** VLMs perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, performing only slightly better than random guessing, due to a lack of explicit causal expressions in their training data.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the evaluation of VLMs within the context of the newly proposed benchmarks and may not be generalizable to all VLM applications.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate a crucial gap in VLMs' capabilities regarding causal reasoning and suggest that targeted fine-tuning may enhance performance while retaining generalization.

**Abstract:** Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance. Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for future work on causal understanding.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current large language models (LLMs) are often biased towards English due to their training on predominantly English data, necessitating better multilingual training approaches.

**Method:** CC-Tuning fuses feed-forward activations from English and non-English inputs, guided by a trainable Decision Maker to enhance cross-lingual interactions at the latent level.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CC-Tuning as a new fine-tuning paradigm for multilingual models.
	2. Establishment of a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level.
	3. Demonstration of performance improvements on multiple multilingual benchmarks.

**Result:** CC-Tuning outperforms standard fine-tuning methods and demonstrates significant improvements in multilingual performance across six benchmarks with 22 languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of latent-level cross-lingual interactions for advancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that CC-Tuning offers a promising alternative to traditional data-level augmentation methods.

**Abstract:** Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Selective Unlearning (SU), a method for removing unwanted information from Large Language Models (LLMs) by selectively forgetting only relevant tokens instead of all tokens in a document.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growing need to eliminate sensitive or copyrighted content from LLMs necessitates effective unlearning methods that do not harm the model's overall utility.

**Method:** Selective Unlearning (SU) identifies and unlearns only a critical subset of tokens related to unwanted information, while preserving general knowledge tokens.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Selective Unlearning (SU) that targets specific tokens for unlearning.
	2. Demonstrated effective unlearning without substantial loss of model performance.
	3. Experimental validation across two benchmarks with six baseline algorithms.

**Result:** Experiments show that SU effectively removes targeted data while significantly maintaining model performance on the retaining set compared to baseline unlearning approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SU represents a more efficient and effective method for LLM unlearning that balances the need to forget certain information with preserving the model's utility.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private, sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

**Motivation:** To address the resource-intensive nature of full-coverage Q&A testing on large-scale data for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM).

**Method:** The paper introduces the MITV strategy, which uses a constructed interview dataset with difficulty labels to assess MLLM performance by quizzing fewer questions across selected topics and then probing model limits.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy for performance assessment

**Result:** Experiments demonstrated that the MITV strategy efficiently evaluates MLLM capabilities on benchmark datasets with a reduced number of questions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The MITV strategy provides a quicker means to assess MLLM performance while maintaining effectiveness using a limited question set.

**Abstract:** The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents A4Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the affordance perception abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), highlighting their limitations in environmental understanding despite outperforming open-source models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore the underdeveloped capability of MLLMs in perceiving affordance, which is important for improving interactions in AI systems.

**Method:** The A4Bench benchmark evaluates MLLMs on two dimensions of affordance: Constitutive Affordance with 1,282 QA pairs and Transformative Affordance with 718 challenging QA pairs, involving assessments of 17 MLLMs against human performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of A4Bench benchmark for affordance perception in MLLMs.
	2. Evaluation across two affordance dimensions with a comprehensive dataset.
	3. Insight into the performance gap between MLLMs and human understanding of affordance.

**Result:** Proprietary models outperform open-source models in affordance perception but all models show limited capabilities, especially in transformative affordance, with the best model achieving only 18.05% accuracy compared to human performance of around 85%.

**Limitations:** Major limitations include the overall low performance of MLLMs in transformative affordance perception and reliance on structured QA pairs.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal critical gaps in MLLMs' environmental understanding, suggesting the need for advancements in context-aware AI interactions.

**Abstract:** Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces SocialEval, a benchmark for evaluating the social intelligence of LLMs by integrating outcome and process-oriented assessments through narrative scripts.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need to evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs and understand how they compare to humans, particularly in terms of interpersonal abilities and goal achievement in social interactions.

**Method:** A script-based bilingual benchmark, SocialEval, is developed that incorporates both outcome-oriented evaluations (goal achievement) and process-oriented evaluations (interpersonal abilities) using manually crafted narrative scripts structured as world trees.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SocialEval benchmark for LLM social intelligence evaluation
	2. Combination of outcome-oriented and process-oriented evaluations
	3. Revelation of LLMs' preference for prosocial behaviors and their representation akin to human cognitive processes.

**Result:** Experiments reveal that LLMs lag behind humans in both social intelligence evaluations, showing prosociality and a preference for positive social behaviors despite potential goal failures.

**Limitations:** The benchmark relies on manually crafted scripts, which may limit its scalability and generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight that LLMs develop ability-specific functional partitions in their representation spaces similar to human brain patterns, indicating a unique approach to social interaction modeling. 

**Abstract:** LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs' formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

	3. Demonstrates superior execution speed and efficiency over existing methods

**Result:** The final SQL program achieves significant execution speed and higher accuracy, outperforming the best existing baseline methods by a valid efficiency score of 4.55 and improving execution accuracy by up to 3.20.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Pi-SQL effectively bridges the gap between natural language and SQL by utilizing Python programs, enhancing both execution accuracy and speed compared to previous approaches.

**Abstract:** Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how transformer-based models represent compound words and whether these representations are compositional, essential for reasoning and generalization in human intelligence.

**Method:** The study evaluates compositionality using six diverse models (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.) to test various embedding models including Mistral, OpenAI Large, Google embeddings, and BERT.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. In-depth evaluation of compositionality in transformer models.
	2. Comparison of six models of compositionality across various embedding models.
	3. Visualization of findings using a synthetic dataset.

**Result:** Ridge regression was found to best account for compositionality among linear models, with vector addition performing competitively. Most embedding models were highly compositional, but BERT showed significantly poorer compositionality.

**Limitations:** The investigation is limited to specific models and may not generalize to all language representations beyond those studied.

**Conclusion:** The findings offer a comprehensive analysis of compositionality in embedding models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, particularly pointing out BERT's limitations.

**Abstract:** Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional. In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of compositionality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The anyECG-chat model represents a significant advancement in the application of MLLMs for ECG analysis, particularly in home care settings and clinical comparisons.

**Abstract:** The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.

In addition, existing detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline. The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

**Motivation:** To generate high-quality mathematical problems that align with educational objectives, addressing the limitations of traditional single-dimensional question generation methods.

**Method:** The paper introduces the EduMath dataset of 16k annotated mathematical questions and the EQPR method which employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search combined with Large Language Models for iterative question optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Construction of EduMath dataset with multi-dimensional objectives

**Result:** EQPR significantly improves the generation of educational questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives as demonstrated through experiments based on EQGEVAL.

**Limitations:** The focus is primarily on mathematical questions, and further research may be needed to extend these methods to other educational domains.

**Conclusion:** The proposed EQPR method offers a novel solution to educational mathematical question generation, ensuring that generated questions effectively fit educational contexts.

**Abstract:** Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology. Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize" approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA. Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior, particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of graded metrics in enhancing the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs by providing a more detailed understanding of risk.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe), overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this, we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news, covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building trustworthy LLMs.

**Abstract:** Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event analysis and improve event extraction methodologies.

**Method:** Introduced a novel approach for abstractive event extraction (AEE) and abstractive entity linking (AEL), utilizing large language models (LLMs) for detection and normalization of event data across a multilingual dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LEMONADE dataset with extensive multilingual coverage.
	2. Development of the AEE and AEL methodologies for improved event extraction.
	3. Establishment of ZEST, a novel retrieval-based system for entity linking.

**Result:** The best zero-shot AEE system achieved an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, while the ZEST entity linking system reached an F1 score of 45.7%, both outperforming previous models.

**Limitations:** Zero-shot results are significantly lower than the best-performing supervised models, pointing to the necessity for ongoing improvement in methodologies.

**Conclusion:** There is a notable performance gap in zero-shot results compared to supervised systems, indicating the need for further research in this area.

**Abstract:** This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising 39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented global conflict events for over a decade.   To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask, abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models. Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for AEL.   Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further research.

**Motivation:** To explore how pre-training on specific languages affects the encoding of linguistic features in self-supervised speech representation models.

**Method:** The study tests the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in Wav2Vec2 models pre-trained on Dutch, English, and multilingual data, using clustering and classification probes as well as zero-shot metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the importance of language-specific pre-training in improving speech representation accuracy
	2. Provided evidence of enhanced encoding of Dutch linguistic features through various probing methods
	3. Aligned performance improvements with downstream Automatic Speech Recognition tasks.

**Result:** Pre-training exclusively on Dutch leads to better representation of Dutch linguistic features compared to pre-training on English or multilingual data, which is reflected in downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Language-specific pre-training enhances the encoding of linguistic features and is beneficial for speech recognition tasks, as shown in the experiments with Wav2Vec2 models.

**Abstract:** How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

**Abstract:** Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

**Result:** Mean local dimensions predict when model training capacities are exhausted, indicating overfitting and grokking in various tasks.

**Limitations:** The exploration may not capture all factors affecting LLM behavior and generalization beyond geometric properties.

**Conclusion:** A reduction in mean local dimensions is a practical heuristic that can predict performance gains, enhancing practitioners' understanding of fine-tuning implications.

**Abstract:** Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how neurons in LLMs co-activate and contribute to emergent capabilities, improving safety and effectiveness in their development.

**Method:** The authors employ graph probing to analyze internal neural graphs of LLMs, examining their connectivity in relation to next-token prediction accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of graph probing for LLMs
	2. Discovery of predictability in next-token prediction based on neural topology
	3. Analysis showing consistent neural structures across various LLMs

**Result:** The study finds a universal predictability of next-token generation performance based solely on neural topology, demonstrating significant robustness even with minimal neuron connections.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Different LLM architectures share similar neural topological structures, which are foundational for their language generation capabilities, indicating a consistency across diverse LLM families.

**Abstract:** Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures, parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language generation abilities.

**Keywords:** SealQA, Language Models, Fact-seeking Questions, Reasoning capabilities, Multi-document reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** SealQA is a benchmark for evaluating search-augmented language models on fact-seeking questions with noisy search results, revealing significant limitations in current models' performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities of language models in scenarios where web search yields conflicting or unhelpful results.

**Method:** SealQA evaluates language models through three variations: Seal-0 and Seal-Hard for factual accuracy and reasoning, and LongSeal for multi-document reasoning in complex contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SealQA as a benchmark
	2. Identification of critical limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs
	3. Release of the dataset for public use to encourage future research

**Result:** The evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs like GPT-4.1 struggle with accuracy, with performances as low as 17.1% and 6.3% on the Seal-0 benchmark; increasing test-time compute does not result in reliable improvements.

**Limitations:** Current models are vulnerable to noisy search results and fail to reliably identify relevant documents in multi-document contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate critical shortcomings in current language models' reasoning abilities, particularly in the presence of noisy information and complex search contexts; future research can use the SealQA dataset for improvement.

**Abstract:** We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, programming languages, neuron activations, concept space, few-shot translation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the concept space of large language models (LLMs) in relation to multiple programming languages (PLs) and English, analyzing embeddings and neuron activations across models during coding tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how LLMs internally represent multiple programming languages alongside English, particularly in coding tasks involving few-shot translation.

**Method:** The study performs a few-shot translation task on 21 programming language pairs using two Llama-based models, decoding embeddings of intermediate layers and analyzing neuron activations for 11 PLs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates the relationship between multiple programming languages and English in LLMs.
	2. Analyzes neuron activations and identifies structural patterns in the concept space of LLMs.
	3. Provides a framework for understanding internal PL representations within LLMs.

**Result:** The analysis reveals that the concept space is closer to English in the intermediate layers, with language-specific neurons found primarily in lower layers and PL-exclusive neurons appearing in higher layers. Highly aligned PLs show shared concept spaces and larger keyword sets.

**Limitations:** Focused primarily on embedding analysis; further studies needed to generalize findings across additional PLs and tasks.

**Conclusion:** The findings enhance the understanding of the structural patterns in LLMs' representation of programming languages and their relationship with English, suggesting implications for future research in context-sensitive coding tasks.

**Abstract:** Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers. We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers, those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept space.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Tokenization, LZW Compression, Inference Efficiency, Dynamic Adaptation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Introducing zip2zip, a dynamic tokenization framework that enhances the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to adapt their token vocabulary at inference time.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiencies of static tokenizers in LLMs, which often result in longer token sequences and higher computational costs due to their inability to adapt to specific domains or languages.

**Method:** The zip2zip framework includes a dynamic tokenizer using LZW compression, an embedding layer for hypertokens, and a causal language model variant for training on compressed sequences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dynamic tokenizer based on LZW compression.
	2. Method for runtime embedding of new hypertokens.
	3. Parameter-efficient finetuning for existing LLMs to use hypertokens.

**Result:** zip2zip LLMs can reduce input and output sequence lengths by 20-60%, leading to significant improvements in inference latency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The zip2zip framework allows for efficient adaptation of token vocabularies during inference, resulting in faster processing of language tasks.

**Abstract:** Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable "hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by 20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on English indexicals, limiting its applicability to other languages and contexts.

**Conclusion:** The evaluation highlights a nuanced understanding of how LLMs interpret indexicals, emphasizing the need for targeted approaches in improving their performance with challenging cases.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g. quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they reduce performance with others.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a new training approach for LLMs aimed at improving their ability to detect unanswerable questions and generate appropriate responses, thus enhancing trust and usability in conversational AI.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issue of factually unsupported or hallucinated responses in LLMs, which hinders their trustworthiness and adoption.

**Method:** RUL combines a discriminative prediction head for unanswerability with the generative capabilities of LLMs, utilizing a multi-stage learning strategy that includes supervised fine-tuning on a novel dataset, followed by reinforcement learning with human feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL) methodology

	3. Demonstrated improvement in trustworthiness and user satisfaction in conversational AI.

**Result:** RUL outperformed traditional methods by demonstrating higher accuracy in detecting unanswerable queries and significantly improving the generation of appropriate refusal responses, while maintaining robust performance on answerable questions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that RUL enhances the reliability and user-centricity of conversational AI, thereby fostering greater trust as demonstrated by human evaluations.

**Abstract:** The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting, RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset, Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness, highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the emergence of semantic concepts in models trained on speech and text and to understand if joint training enhances semantic understanding.

**Method:** We use Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method, to examine and interpret the latent representations formed by speech and textual models, both individually and jointly.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces Latent Concept Analysis for interpreting multimodal models.
	2. Analyzes the semantic understanding of speech versus text models.
	3. Provides resources and scripts for reproducibility.

**Result:** Our analysis reveals how semantic abstractions are formed across modalities, contributing insights into the comparative understanding of speech and text models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that joint training on multiple modalities potentially leads to a richer conceptual structure, enhancing semantic understanding in neural networks.

**Abstract:** The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities: Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities. For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the community.

**Motivation:** To develop mispronunciation detection tools for low-resourced languages like Finland Swedish, which currently lack adequate support.

**Method:** A multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model was trained with entropy regularization, temperature scaling, and top-k normalization for mispronunciation detection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a mispronunciation detection model for Finland Swedish
	2. Utilization of minimal L2 data
	3. Language-independent approach applicable to other low-resource languages

**Result:** The method achieved a Recall of 43.2% and Precision of 29.8%, significantly improving the balance compared to the baseline model's Recall of 77.5% and Precision of 17.6%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed algorithm is effective for low-resource languages and requires minimal L2 data, making it widely applicable.

**Abstract:** Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS, trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.   We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization, followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity, requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the impact of data leakage in psycholinguistic modeling by analyzing reading times and NLP model predictions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate whether data leakage from training corpora affects the performance of pre-trained language models in predicting human reading times.

**Method:** Two studies were conducted: the first assessed token overlap between reading time corpora and pre-training datasets, while the second evaluated the relationship between model size and surprisals using 'leakage-free' data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated minimal data leakage in reading time corpora
	2. Confirmed negative relationship between model size and predictive fit of surprisal
	3. Provided insights into the reliability of language models in psycholinguistic contexts

**Result:** The first study found minimal leakage in token overlap, and the second study confirmed that larger language models fit surprisal to reading times poorly, independent of any observed data leakage.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that previous discrepancies between language model predictions and human reading times are not primarily driven by data leakage from training corpora.

**Abstract:** In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on 'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora. Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task for improving user-directed attribution in grounded text generation, enabling fine-grained localization of generated content to its source material.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for attributing generated text to sources often overwhelm users or fail to align with their interests, necessitating a more tailored approach.

**Method:** The paper compares two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models and leveraging their internal representations, and presents a modeling framework extending existing text generation attribution methods to the LAQuer context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability
	2. Suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines
	3. Proposing a new evaluation setting for localized attribution research

**Result:** LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text in evaluated tasks like Multi-document Summarization and Long-form Question Answering.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The contributions include the proposal of the LAQuer task, a modeling framework with benchmarks, and a novel evaluation setting to guide future research in localized attribution.

**Abstract:** Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast, existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2) suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3) proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized attribution in content-grounded generation.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for low-resource NLP.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To fill the gap in understanding non-cooperative discourse as most existing work focuses on cooperativity in language use, especially in high-stakes situations.

**Method:** The authors propose CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response Assessment) with three metrics (BaT, PaT, NRBaT) and utilize CHARM, a dataset of courtroom cross-examinations, to evaluate these metrics on various LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoBRA for analyzing non-cooperative discourse
	2. Development of three interpretable metrics for discourse moves
	3. Creation of CHARM dataset for courtroom exchanges

**Result:** The evaluation shows that LLMs generally exhibit poor pragmatic understanding of strategic language, with larger model sizes correlating with increased performance on the proposed metrics; however, reasoning ability tends to hinder rather than help.

**Limitations:** Model reasoning ability complicates performance, revealing that larger models may introduce confusion rather than clarity in understanding strategic language.

**Conclusion:** Despite improvements with larger models, the understanding of non-cooperative discourse remains limited, urging further research in the area.

**Abstract:** Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT), Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

**Keywords:** Sparse Autoencoders, Semantic Hierarchy, Large Language Models

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a modified Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) architecture that models a semantic hierarchy of concepts, enhancing reconstruction, interpretability, and computational efficiency in large language models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of traditional sparse dictionary learning approaches that fail to exploit or represent semantic relationships among learned concepts.

**Method:** The authors present a modified Sparse Autoencoder architecture that incorporates a semantic hierarchy into the concept learning process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of semantic hierarchy in sparse autoencoders
	2. Improved reconstruction and interpretability of learned concepts
	3. Enhanced computational efficiency in large language models

**Result:** The proposed architecture enables the learning of semantic hierarchies and shows improvements in reconstruction quality and interpretability in large language models, along with increased computational efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of semantic hierarchy in sparse autoencoders leads to better performance in terms of reconstruction and understanding of internal representations in language models.

**Abstract:** Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces an adversarial ambiguity dataset to evaluate language models' sensitivity to ambiguity and finds that linear probes are more effective than direct prompts in identifying ambiguity.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to better understand language models' handling of ambiguity, which is crucial for tasks such as uncertainty estimation and comprehension.

**Method:** An adversarial ambiguity dataset was created, incorporating various forms of ambiguity. The performance of language models was assessed using both direct prompting and linear probes based on model representations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an adversarial ambiguity dataset.
	2. Demonstration of the limitations of direct prompting for ambiguity detection.
	3. High accuracy of linear probes in decoding ambiguity.

**Result:** Linear probes trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy, achieving results sometimes exceeding 90%. Meanwhile, direct prompting was less effective in identifying ambiguity.

**Limitations:** The study does not explore the effect of different model architectures on ambiguity sensitivity.

**Conclusion:** The research provides insights into the effectiveness of different approaches in identifying ambiguity in language models and suggests a need for better prompting strategies.

**Abstract:** Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences. We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy, sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We release both our code and data: https://github.com/coastalcph/lm_ambiguity.

**Motivation:** To address the trade-offs between external drafters' flexibility and self-speculation methods' efficiency in large language model generation.

**Method:** The authors propose novel drafters based on Mamba, a state space model, enhancing drafting speed and reducing complexity through a test-time tree search algorithm.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Mamba-based drafters for LLM generation
	2. Reduction of memory usage with linear structure of SSMs
	3. Novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating draft candidates

**Result:** Mamba-based drafters demonstrate improved performance over existing external drafting methods and are competitive with self-speculation approaches while using less memory.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mamba-based drafters effectively combine the benefits of flexibility and efficiency in large language model generation.

**Abstract:** Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of REFORM framework for long context processing
	2. Two-phase processing approach enhancing efficiency
	3. Significant performance and memory improvements over existing methods

**Result:** REFORM shows over 50% improvement on RULER and 27% on BABILong at 1M context length, along with strong performance on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH while reducing inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework demonstrates the ability to handle long contexts efficiently while maintaining superior performance across various tasks and domains.

**Abstract:** As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.

**Motivation:** To evaluate and improve the linguistic competence of LLMs and understand their limitations in handling complex linguistic tasks in the Korean language.

**Method:** Creation of a benchmark consisting of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs across five categories and 16 subcategories; evaluation of 27 LLMs under zero-shot conditions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the KoGEM benchmark for Korean linguistic evaluation

**Result:** LLMs perform well on straightforward tasks but struggle with those requiring real-world knowledge integration, highlighting a gap in experiential linguistic competence.

**Limitations:** Focuses solely on Korean language and may not generalize to other languages or LLMs

**Conclusion:** Incorporating experiential knowledge could enhance LLMs' linguistic capabilities and understanding.

**Abstract:** We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar \underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories. The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs. With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence, paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Existing LLMs require significant advancement for expert-level applications, and the CLEAR framework facilitates more effective and scalable evaluation of long-form outputs.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

**Conclusion:** The establishment of domain-aligned benchmarks like MTCMB is crucial for developing competent and trustworthy medical AI systems in the TCM field.

**Abstract:** Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning, diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism. To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning, prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts, providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models. Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and trustworthy medical AI systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the variability in model capabilities regarding condition identification and generation, emphasizing the importance of conditions in reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging. We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks. We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

**Motivation:** FastText suffers from hash collisions causing semantic drift and high memory costs when handling large vocabularies, prompting the need for memory optimization.

**Method:** The proposed framework integrates double-array trie structures and mark-compact garbage collection principles to manage memory efficiently, involving phases like trie construction, prefix-based and suffix-based similarity compression, and memory reorganization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introducing a memory optimization framework for FastText
	2. Achieving high compression ratios while maintaining embedding quality
	3. Demonstrating substantial real-world deployment benefits, including cost savings and improved reliability.

**Result:** The method achieved compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1, reducing memory usage from over 100GB to approximately 30GB on a 30-million Chinese vocabulary dataset with negligible performance loss.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework significantly enhances FastText's deployment capabilities in industrial settings, offering cost reductions and faster model loading times by eliminating hash collision issues.

**Abstract:** FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language. By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping, prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

**Motivation:** To improve recognition accuracy of proper nouns and unknown terms in speech recognition systems, which are often biased towards training vocabulary.

**Method:** Utilizes keyword spotting with acoustic features from intermediate layers during inference and applies biases to the acoustic model for recognized keywords. Employs a wildcard CTC for flexible matching.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Improves speech recognition for rare words without additional training.
	2. Adopts a wildcard CTC that allows flexible word matching.
	3. Demonstrates significant performance improvement in experiments.

**Result:** Achieved a 29% improvement in F1 score for unknown words in Japanese speech recognition experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method allows for better recognition of difficult words without the need for retraining existing models, making it applicable to large-scale systems.

**Abstract:** Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems. Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches, allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for unknown words.

	3. Generalizability and learnability of LongGuide across different models

**Result:** LongGuide improves performance by over 5% in both zero- and few-shot settings across strong open- and closed-source LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that explicit exposure to task distributions through LongGuide significantly enhances the ability of LLMs for long-form generation tasks.

**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning. Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines (MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable, learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically with automatic prompt optimizers.

### [184] [Detoxification of Large Language Models through Output-layer Fusion with a Calibration Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01266)

*Yuanhe Tian, Mingjie Deng, Guoqing Jin, Yan Song*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Detoxification, Calibration Model, Toxicity Reduction, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel approach for detoxifying large language models (LLMs) using a pre-trained calibration model, which guides the detoxification process effectively without significant computational costs.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing LLM detoxification methods are often computationally expensive and compromise the fluency of the models, motivating the need for a more efficient approach.

**Method:** The authors introduce a compact, pre-trained calibration model that provides lightweight interventions in the generation pipeline of a target LLM, steering it away from generating harmful content by learning from non-toxic data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a calibration model for LLM detoxification
	2. Demonstration of lightweight intervention in LLM generation
	3. Showcasing reduced toxicity with maintained fluency in outputs

**Result:** Experiment results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces toxicity in LLM outputs while maintaining the models' fluency and contextual understanding, as evaluated on benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The calibration model allows for a one-time training to be applied across multiple LLMs, thus enhancing their safety without sacrificing performance.

**Abstract:** Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data, designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of adaptability in existing UIE systems when selecting between predefined schemas and generating new schemas dynamically, which can hinder their performance.

**Method:** The paper proposes a unified framework, SPT, that treats predefined schemas as parameterized tools, allowing for schema retrieval, filling, and generation to improve adaptability in UIE tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT) framework for UIE
	2. Unified approach to schema retrieval, filling, and generation
	3. Demonstrated robust performance across multiple IE tasks with fewer parameters.

**Result:** SPT shows robust performance in handling four distinct IE tasks and achieves comparable extraction results to leading systems while using significantly fewer parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SPT framework enhances the adaptability of UIE systems, improving their ability to select and generate schemas on-the-fly, thus addressing current limitations in the field.

**Abstract:** Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm, especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively, delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

**Conclusion:** The benchmark has implications for enhancing multilingual language model evaluation in healthcare, and the open-source data construction pipeline enables future developments.

**Abstract:** Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources, including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels, ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a scalable episodic learning framework that enhances medium-sized language models (LMs) by effectively transferring episodic behaviors from smaller LMs, integrating Monte Carlo tree search and a novel distillation method to improve physical planning tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to address the scalability and integration challenges of current episodic grounding approaches in language models, particularly for medium-sized models that struggle to leverage experience efficiently.

**Method:** The authors propose a weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that combines Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a new distillation method. This approach transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs, enhancing their planning capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Scalable framework for episodic learning in LMs
	2. Integration of Monte Carlo tree search for experience collection
	3. Improvement in task performance and generalization in planning and QA tasks

**Result:** Experiments show that the new framework surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary language models by 3.45% in various planning and question-answering tasks, indicating significant performance improvement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method achieves better task alignment and generalization in larger language models, particularly in deeper layers that handle complex planning scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance the capabilities of LMs through episodic memory integration.

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration, limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters). While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities, they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks. Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of psychological support hotlines amidst rising demand by evaluating LLMs for crisis assessment tasks.

**Method:** Introduced PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, evaluating LLMs on tasks including mood status recognition and risk assessment via zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PsyCrisisBench benchmark for mental health LLM evaluation
	2. Demonstration of LLM effectiveness in various crisis assessment tasks
	3. Discussion of the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models

**Result:** LLMs showed strong performance in suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), risk assessment (F1=0.907), and improved outcomes with few-shot learning; mood recognition had a max F1 of 0.709.

**Limitations:** Mood recognition faced challenges due to lost vocal cues and contextual ambiguity.

**Conclusion:** LLMs hold significant promise for structured psychological crisis assessments, though mood recognition needs improvement; the paper provides a framework for ethical model deployment in mental health.

**Abstract:** Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across 15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open- and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed CoCoBMs provide a more effective way to utilize concepts in image classification, enhancing both performance and interpretability compared to traditional methods.

**Abstract:** Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances interpretability assessments by 30%.

**Motivation:** Existing benchmarks do not adequately assess iterative reasoning required in real-world applications, which This paper aims to address.

**Method:** TurnBench introduces a code-breaking task with two modes: Classic for standard reasoning and Nightmare for enhanced complexity, requiring models to reason sequentially and maintain consistency over multiple rounds with feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TurnBench for multi-turn reasoning evaluation
	2. Two distinct modes of testing (Classic and Nightmare) with varying complexity
	3. Ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps provided

**Result:** The best LLM achieved 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but only 17.8% in Nightmare mode, while humans achieved 100% accuracy in both modes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TurnBench highlights the significant challenges faced by current LLMs in multi-step reasoning, providing a rigorous platform for development.

**Abstract:** Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses, receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds. This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both, underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn reasoning in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution
	2. Development of FlowPathAgent for automated attribution
	3. Creation of FlowExplainBench benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions

**Result:** FlowPathAgent mitigates hallucinations in LLM answers by achieving a 10-14% performance improvement on the FlowExplainBench benchmark compared to strong baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By enabling fine-grained attribution in flowchart analysis, this approach enhances the verifiability and reliability of LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart, then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the mechanism of RLVR in training language models and its effectiveness on reasoning tasks.

**Method:** The authors decompose the learning signal into Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement, training Qwen models on a mathematical reasoning dataset and analyzing performance changes across different configurations of reward structures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the decomposition of learning signals into Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement.
	2. Demonstrated that training solely with negative samples can outperform models trained with correct responses included.
	3. Proposed a modified RL objective that upweights NSR, leading to consistent performance improvements.

**Result:** Training with only negative samples (NSR) showed improved performance over the base model across Pass@$k$ metrics, often surpassing traditional methods like PPO and GRPO.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Negative Sample Reinforcement may contribute significantly to performance, emphasizing its importance compared to Positive Sample Reinforcement in certain contexts.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to $256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

**Limitations:** Primarily focused on a Japanese context; applicability to other languages or cultural contexts may need further exploration.

**Conclusion:** The role-playing approach effectively produces a valuable dataset for psychological counseling, ensuring both quality and privacy preservation.

**Abstract:** Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, hallucination detection, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, machine translation, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces MMD-Flagger, a method for detecting hallucinated content generated by large language models using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in critical applications is hindered by their tendency to produce content that may not reflect reality, necessitating effective detection methods for hallucinations.

**Method:** MMD-Flagger employs Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to track the distance between distributions of generated documents at different temperature parameters, analyzing the resulting trajectory shape to identify hallucinations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MMD-Flagger for hallucination detection in LLMs
	2. Use of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as a novel detection mechanism
	3. Empirical benchmarking showing high effectiveness on machine translation tasks

**Result:** MMD-Flagger was empirically tested on two machine translation datasets and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods in detecting hallucinations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that MMD-Flagger is effective in addressing the hallucination problem in LLMs, helping to enhance the reliability of AI-generated content.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet, a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content, MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms natural competitors.

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that AdaRewriter presents a promising solution for improving conversational query reformulation, making it more effective through adaptive learning at inference time.

**Abstract:** Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability. However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

**TL;DR:** SEAL introduces a novel framework for training small language models to anonymize text effectively while avoiding reliance on costly external models, demonstrating improved privacy-utility trade-offs over traditional methods.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the increasing use of large language models in sensitive areas, privacy risks from personal data inference require effective anonymization methods that do not rely on expensive external models.

**Method:** SEAL employs a distillation framework that incorporates adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to train small language models in anonymization through supervised fine-tuning and preference learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SEAL framework for training small language models for anonymization
	2. Improvement of privacy-utility trade-offs in anonymization compared to GPT-4
	3. Release of a dataset for further research on the proposed methods.

**Result:** SLMs trained with SEAL show significant improvements in anonymization capabilities, achieving a comparable privacy-utility trade-off to GPT-4, and surpassing it with self-refinement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SEAL framework effectively trains small language models to perform anonymization efficiently, reducing reliance on larger, proprietary models, and enhancing privacy protections.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full dataset used in our experiments.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the effects of post-hoc dimensionality reduction on task-specific text embeddings, revealing that significant reductions maintain performance for classification and clustering tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rise in use of high-dimensional text embeddings necessitates examining their redundancy to reduce storage and computational costs without sacrificing performance.

**Method:** The study applies various levels of post-hoc dimensionality reduction to task-specific embeddings and evaluates performance across classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated minimal performance impact of aggressive dimensionality reduction on task-specific embeddings.
	2. Introduced quantitative analysis of intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy in embeddings.
	3. Showed redundancy in text embeddings, allowing for storage and computation efficiency.

**Result:** Performance degradation is minimal even when reducing embeddings to less than 0.5% of original dimensionality; intrinsic dimensionality analysis shows redundancy in embeddings used for classification and clustering.

**Limitations:** The study may not fully address performance impacts across all potential NLP tasks or varied embedding models.

**Conclusion:** Dimensionality reduction can be significantly applied to text embeddings without major performance loss, particularly in classification and clustering tasks, highlighting their inherent redundancy.

**Abstract:** Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant. Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

**Abstract:** Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task. Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities, concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in association mining business applications for institutions.

**Motivation:** To address limitations of traditional models in understanding pragmatic language use by eliminating manual specification of utterances and meanings.

**Method:** The study involves a case analysis of pragmatic question-answering, introducing various integrations of neural modules within cognitive models to assess performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of LLMs in cognitive models enhances natural language processing capabilities.
	2. Demonstrates improved modeling of pragmatic language use without manual specification.
	3. Identifies critical design considerations for the effectiveness of neural and symbolic components.

**Result:** Hybrid models integrating LLMs match or exceed traditional probabilistic models in predicting human behaviors, with notable effectiveness in proposing language alternatives and managing abstract goals.

**Limitations:** Challenges remain in truth-conditional semantic evaluation by LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The neuro-symbolic model offers a promising direction for scalable pragmatic language models while highlighting key integration challenges of LLMs.

**Abstract:** Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for balancing neural and symbolic components.

**Motivation:** The rise of toxic content online necessitates effective detoxification methods, yet high-quality parallel datasets for this task are lacking.

**Method:** The study employs a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline using GPT-4o-mini to automate the detoxification process, replacing human annotators and creating the PARADEHATE dataset of over 8,000 hate/non-hate text pairs.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLM-generated detoxification offers a scalable and effective alternative to traditional human annotation methods for addressing hate speech.

**Abstract:** Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

**Conclusion:** The ACCI method effectively mitigates spurious correlations in coreference resolution while maintaining an end-to-end training procedure.

**Abstract:** Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence. However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of 88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multilingual, definition modeling, large language models, cross-lingual, BERTScore

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a multilingual study on definition modeling using monolingual dictionary data for four languages and evaluates pre-trained multilingual models and LLMs in this context.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the performance of multilingual models in definition modeling across different languages and compare it with English-based models and LLMs.

**Method:** The authors performed an empirical study using dictionary data for Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German, finetuning multilingual language models and employing a zero-shot approach for LLMs on the definition modeling task.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First multilingual study on definition modeling
	2. Use of monolingual dictionary data for multiple languages
	3. Demonstration of LLMs' zero and few-shot capabilities in a new task

**Result:** Results indicate that while multilingual models perform comparably to English models, they fail to exploit cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally outperforming multilingual models.

**Limitations:** The performance of multilingual models does not leverage cross-lingual synergies.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests that definition modeling can be approached with a compute-constrained method and that LLMs possess both strengths and weaknesses in generating definitions.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Cultural Values, Ethical AI, Chinese Values, Value Alignment

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a hierarchical value framework based on Chinese values and constructs a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) to enhance the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse cultural contexts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to address Western cultural bias and develop a scalable framework for aligning LLMs with universal human values and ethical norms across different cultures, particularly within Chinese cultural contexts.

**Method:** A hierarchical value framework was developed to define core Chinese values, resulting in the creation of a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) with 250,000 value rules. This corpus was used to generate scenarios which were evaluated against mainstream LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a hierarchical value framework based on core Chinese values
	2. Creation of a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) with 250,000 value rules
	3. Establishment of a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for LLM value evaluation

**Result:** CVC-guided scenarios showed improved performance over direct generation in value boundaries and content diversity, with LLMs preferring CVC options in over 70.5% of cases across sensitive themes, and human annotators exhibiting 87.5% alignment with CVC values.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment that represents Chinese characteristics, supporting the safe development of LLMs across diverse cultural contexts.

**Abstract:** Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics. All data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Beijing-AISI/CVC, and the code is available at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/CVC.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach demonstrates effective adaptation to new speech tasks without the need for full retraining.

**Abstract:** Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks, demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

### [213] [Representations of Fact, Fiction and Forecast in Large Language Models: Epistemics and Attitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01512)

*Meng Li, Michael Vrazitulis, David Schlangen*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, epistemic modality, uncertainty awareness, HCI, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper examines the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in generating reliable expressions of uncertainty, emphasizing the need for enriched semantic knowledge of epistemic modality for effective uncertainty management.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current LLMs struggle to generate utterances that accurately reflect their confidence in uncertain real-world situations, which is an essential feature for rational communication.

**Method:** The study evaluates LLMs' understanding of epistemic modality by using controlled narratives and typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to assess the generated outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLMs' linguistic knowledge of uncertainty
	2. Identification of limitations in current LLMs regarding epistemic expression generation
	3. Insights into improving LLMs for better uncertainty management

**Result:** LLMs exhibited limited and inconsistent performance in generating appropriate epistemic expressions, indicating an inadequacy in expressing uncertainty reliably.

**Limitations:** The performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions was found to be not robust, indicating a gap in their linguistic capabilities regarding uncertainty.

**Conclusion:** To enhance LLMs' handling of uncertainty, it is crucial to enrich their semantic knowledge regarding epistemic modalities.

**Abstract:** Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite aimed at improving form filling tasks using MLLMs, highlighting the limitations of current models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite advances in MLLMs, existing tools for online form filling are rule-based and struggle with challenges like flexible layouts and aligning instructions with fields.

**Method:** We propose FormFactory, a benchmarking suite with a web interface and dataset to evaluate MLLMs on form filling tasks, incorporating diverse scenarios and field formats.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FormFactory as a benchmarking suite for form filling tasks.
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on this task, revealing significant performance gaps.
	3. Formal definition of the form-filling task and its unique challenges.

**Result:** Comprehensive evaluations show that no MLLM surpasses 5% accuracy on the form filling task, indicating significant challenges in visual reasoning and alignment.

**Limitations:** Current MLLMs exhibit poor accuracy and struggle with visual layout reasoning and alignment of field values.

**Conclusion:** FormFactory can serve as a stepping stone for research into more effective form-filling agents, addressing the limitations highlighted in our evaluations.

**Abstract:** Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into robust, practical form-filling agents.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework for enhancing persona-specific response generation in LLM-based chatbots, along with a new dataset and benchmark.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address limitations in existing persona-based chat approaches, which rely on static descriptions and fail to capture dynamic traits in conversations.

**Method:** Proposes a V-VAE framework that adapts dialogue behavior based on fine-grained latent variables related to talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework for dynamic persona modeling
	2. Creation of the HumanChatData dataset for high-quality conversational data
	3. Benchmarking tools (HumanChatBench) for evaluating LLM performance in human-like dialogue

**Result:** LLMs trained with the V-VAE framework outperform standard baselines on the newly established HumanChatBench and DialogBench benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The V-VAE framework and the HumanChatData dataset effectively improve the quality and relevance of responses in human-like chat applications.

**Abstract:** With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** High-quality math datasets are essential for enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet current datasets have notable deficiencies in difficulty, reasoning quality, and reliability.

**Method:** Developed a human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework combining human evaluations with reasoning-dense filters and collaboration among agents to create math problems derived from academic papers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the STORM-BORN dataset with a focus on difficult mathematical reasoning
	2. Introduction of a novel multi-agent generation framework for dataset creation
	3. Demonstrated significant accuracy improvements for LLMs after fine-tuning on the dataset.

**Result:** The dataset comprises 2,000 synthetic samples, with 100 challenging problems; advanced models struggled to solve them, and fine-tuning on STORM-BORN improved model accuracy significantly by approximately 8-9%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** STORM-BORN serves as a high-difficulty benchmark and a resource for training models on human-like reasoning in mathematics, contributing meaningfully to the field.

**Abstract:** High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000 synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems. Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them. Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$ (Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lwhere/STORM-BORN.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new vocabulary transfer method for adapting pre-trained language models to low-resource languages using bilingual dictionaries.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the challenges of adapting pre-trained language models to low-resource languages, which often lack sufficient monolingual and parallel corpora.

**Method:** The authors propose a method that utilizes bilingual dictionaries alongside BPE tokenizers to iteratively estimate the embeddings of target subwords by removing them from the tokenizer.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dictionary-based vocabulary transfer method
	2. Showcasing improvements over existing methods for low-resource languages
	3. Utilization of BPE tokenizer properties for effective embedding estimation

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that this dictionary-based approach significantly outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages in cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the effectiveness of leveraging bilingual dictionaries to enhance vocabulary transfer in language models for low-resource settings.

**Abstract:** Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages. Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages, demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** cultural analysis, cultural visual understanding, cultural image transcreation

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Hanfu-Bench, a multimodal dataset focused on temporal aspects of cultural understanding, specifically through the lens of Hanfu, a traditional Chinese garment.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of temporal aspects in cultural understanding studies relying on vision-language models (VLMs) and to provide a framework for evaluating these models in the context of cultural heritage.

**Method:** The dataset comprises two tasks: cultural visual understanding, which assesses temporal-cultural feature recognition, and cultural image transcreation, which involves transforming traditional attire into modern designs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Hanfu-Bench dataset for temporal cultural understanding
	2. Evaluation of VLMs against human experts in recognizing cultural features
	3. Assessment of VLMs in transcreating traditional attire into modern designs

**Result:** Closed VLMs performed comparably to non-experts in cultural visual understanding but were 10% behind human experts. For the transcreation task, the best model's success rate is only 42%.

**Limitations:** VLMs significantly underperform compared to human experts, indicating room for improvement in model design and training for cultural understanding tasks.

**Conclusion:** Hanfu-Bench serves as a benchmark revealing significant challenges in achieving accurate temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation with VLMs.

**Abstract:** Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the effectiveness of prompt engineering in improving large language model performance for complex tasks like forecasting.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the capacity of prompt engineering to enhance accuracy in AI forecasting, which is often regarded as less effective for complex domains compared to robust methods.

**Method:** The study evaluated 38 prompts across several large language models and introduced both compound prompts and prompts from external sources, including models designed for reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of 38 prompts across multiple large language models
	2. Identification of minimal gains from prompt modifications in complex tasks
	3. Highlighting negative impacts of certain prompting strategies on accuracy

**Result:** The findings revealed that most prompt modifications led to minimal gains in forecasting accuracy, with some prompts even having negative impacts, particularly those encouraging Bayesian reasoning.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on specific forecasting tasks and may not be generalizable to all areas where large language models are applied.

**Conclusion:** The research indicates that simple prompt engineering is insufficient for improving performance in complex forecasting tasks, suggesting the need for more sophisticated techniques.

**Abstract:** Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways. Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits. Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy: especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI forecasting.

**TL;DR:** This study focuses on developing a reliable dataset for fake news detection in Urdu, addressing the scarcity of resources and validating it using advanced language models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The proliferation of misinformation in social media and the lack of resources for detecting fake news in under-resourced languages, particularly Urdu, necessitates the creation of reliable datasets.

**Method:** The study presents the first publicly available benchmark for Urdu fake news detection, using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for evaluation and comparison.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the first benchmark dataset for Urdu fake news detection.
	2. Evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs on the dataset.
	3. Proposal of a unified LLM model that surpasses existing models in performance.

**Result:** The proposed Urdu FND dataset supports validation and deep analysis, and a unified LLM model is shown to outperform existing models in the detection task.

**Limitations:** The focus on a specific language may limit generalization to other languages or domains.

**Conclusion:** The development of a robust Urdu-enhanced FND dataset is essential for improving fake news detection in both Urdu and other resource-constrained languages, indicating the potential for similar efforts in other languages.

**Abstract:** The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore if encoder-only models can rival LLMs in zero-shot cross-lingual generalization and offer efficient alternatives for low-resource languages.

**Method:** The paper adapts Statement Tuning to reformulate multilingual NLP tasks into templates suitable for encoder models and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art encoders in a zero-shot context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Adapting Statement Tuning for multilingual NLP
	2. Demonstrating competitive performance of encoders in zero-shot tasks
	3. Providing insights into dataset design and efficiency gains for low-resource languages

**Result:** Findings reveal that encoder models achieve competitive performance in multilingual tasks, similar to multilingual LLMs, while consuming fewer resources.

**Limitations:** The approach may still struggle with highly complex or nuanced language-specific tasks compared to LLMs.

**Conclusion:** Encoders can effectively generalize across languages, suggesting a shift towards more resource-efficient NLP models for multilingual applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP, exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient. We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains, and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and resource-efficient NLP models.

**Keywords:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Indian languages, evaluation benchmarks, multilingual datasets, natural language processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents the IndicMSMarco multilingual benchmark and a large-scale dataset for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in Indian languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The development of high-quality RAG systems for Indian languages is limited due to the scarcity of evaluation benchmarks and large-scale datasets for multilingual retrieval.

**Method:** Creation of IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, and a dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from 19 Indian language Wikipedias.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for Indian languages.
	2. Development of a large-scale dataset from Indian language Wikipedias for RAG training.
	3. Inclusion of translated MS MARCO dataset versions to improve data alignment.

**Result:** Introduced IndicMSMarco benchmark and a large-scale dataset that enhances training and evaluation capabilities for RAG systems in Indian languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new resources will facilitate the advancement of RAG systems in Indian languages, addressing significant shortcomings in current evaluations and training datasets.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

**Keywords:** BERT, Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Recognition, Lexical Knowledge

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method to enhance BERT embeddings for text classification tasks by incorporating domain-specific lexical knowledge, leading to improved performance in sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and question answering.

**Read time:** 13 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of BERT in text classification applications where keywords are crucial for predicting class labels.

**Method:** A knowledge-based embedding enhancement model is developed that projects BERT embeddings into a space maximizing within-class similarity and between-class difference, along with a knowledge acquisition algorithm to collect lexical knowledge from online sources.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a knowledge-based embedding enhancement model for BERT.
	2. Introduction of a knowledge acquisition algorithm for lexical knowledge extraction.
	3. Demonstrated improved classification performance on multiple NLP tasks.

**Result:** Experiment results indicate significant improvements in text classification performance over traditional BERT embeddings on sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and question answering tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed word embedding enhancement model effectively improves classification accuracy in applications where keyword relevance is high, showcasing the importance of integrating lexical knowledge into embeddings.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel neural network model, MVAN, for detecting fake news on social media using only tweet content and its retweets, outperforming existing methods by 2.5% in accuracy.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the serious problem of fake news on social media, particularly in scenarios with limited input data like short tweets and retweets, where existing methods fall short.

**Method:** Developed the Multi-View Attention Networks (MVAN) model which combines text semantic attention and propagation structure attention to effectively detect fake news and provide explanations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MVAN model for fake news detection using short tweets.
	2. Combination of two attention mechanisms to extract key clues from texts and user propagation structures.
	3. Empirical results proving the model's superiority over existing detection methods.

**Result:** MVAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.5% in accuracy on two real-world datasets and produces reasonable explanations for its detections.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The MVAN model demonstrates that it is viable to detect fake news effectively in more realistic scenarios with limited data while providing explanatory insights.

**Abstract:** Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user comments. We develop a novel neural network based model, \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a reasonable explanation.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the evolution of parameter spaces in multilingual language models during pre-training, revealing the transition from language-specific to cross-lingual representations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how multilingual language models develop their ability to transfer knowledge across languages without explicit supervision.

**Method:** The authors analyze the parameter spaces of three multilingual language models, conducting probing experiments to examine the evolution of language representations during pre-training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of parameter evolution in multilingual language models during pre-training.
	2. Identification of neurons that become reliable predictors across languages.
	3. Insights into the transition from language-specific to cross-lingual representations.

**Result:** The study finds that multilingual models transition from forming language-specific representations to developing cross-lingual abstractions, with specific neurons aligning across languages as reliable predictors of the same concepts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that multilingual language models exhibit clear patterns of parameter evolution that enhance their cross-lingual capabilities, suggesting a deep interconnection between language representations as training progresses.

**Abstract:** Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for the same concepts across languages.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, ESG, sustainability, evaluation, retrieval-augmented generation

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** ESGenius is a benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) proficiency in ESG and sustainability-focused question answering through a two-component system that includes a QA dataset and a curated corpus of related documents.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a growing need for LLMs to effectively understand and respond to questions related to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics and sustainability, which are increasingly important in various fields.

**Method:** The benchmark includes ESGenius-QA, a set of 1,136 rigorously validated multiple-choice questions, and ESGenius-Corpus, a collection of authoritative documents for contextual grounding. A two-stage evaluation approach (Zero-Shot and RAG) was employed across 50 LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ESGenius as the first benchmark for ESG and sustainability in LLMs
	2. Development of ESGenius-QA with validated questions linked to authoritative sources
	3. Demonstration of significant performance gains in LLMs using retrieval-augmented generation.

**Result:** Results show that state-of-the-art models achieve moderate performance (55-70% accuracy) in zero-shot settings, while models using RAG techniques exhibit significant improvements, with some models improving from around 64% to over 80% accuracy.

**Limitations:** The performance of LLMs is moderate even in RAG settings for some tasks, indicating limitations in current model capabilities.

**Conclusion:** ESGenius demonstrates that grounding model responses in reliable sources is crucial for improving understanding of ESG topics, highlighting the potential for RAG methods to enhance LLM performance.

**Abstract:** We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136 multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231 foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example, "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\% with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

**Keywords:** Cultural knowledge, Language adaptation, Large language models, Multilingualism, Knowledge transfer

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during the adaptation of large language models, revealing asymmetric knowledge transfer patterns between high- and low-resource languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the mechanisms behind cultural knowledge acquisition in multilingual settings and its impact on large language models.

**Method:** An interpretable framework was introduced to study cultural knowledge transfer across languages, controlling for data transparency and transfer effects. The study analyzed four non-Anglophonic cultures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a framework for studying cultural knowledge transfer in LLMs.
	2. Identified asymmetric knowledge transfer patterns based on resource language status.
	3. Proposed and validated a frequency-based hypothesis related to knowledge transfer.

**Result:** Bidirectional cultural transfer was observed between English and high-resource languages, while low-resource languages predominantly transferred knowledge to English, demonstrating an asymmetric transfer pattern.

**Limitations:** Focused primarily on the relationship between English and other languages, which may limit insights into other linguistic dynamics.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that cultural knowledge transfer is influenced by the frequency of cultural knowledge in pretraining data, with more frequent knowledge being transferred more easily between languages.

**Abstract:** Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Tokenization, Large Language Models, Subword Understanding

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces StochasTok, a stochastic tokenization scheme that enhances LLMs' ability to understand subword-level tasks by allowing them to see the internal structure of tokens during training.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current LLMs struggle with subword-level tasks due to tokenization methods that obscure the fine-grained structure of words, leading to poor performance on simple tasks.

**Method:** StochasTok randomly splits tokens during training, enabling LLMs to better grasp their internal structure, and can be integrated at any stage of the training pipeline.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of StochasTok for improved subword understanding in LLMs
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple tasks with minimal training changes
	3. Possibility to enhance existing pretrained models post-training

**Result:** Pretraining with StochasTok significantly improves LLMs' performance on subword-level tasks, such as character counting, substring identification, and math tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** StochasTok's simplicity and efficiency hold potential for enhancing larger models without the need for costly pretraining.

**Abstract:** Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming, and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in 'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple subword-level language games, including character counting, substring identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch. These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional affective computing tasks and enhance real-time human-machine interactions through collaborative Large Language Models.

**Method:** A systematic review of collaboration strategies, experimental comparisons across tasks, and analysis of key challenges in LLM-based collaboration in Affective Computing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic review of current LLM-based collaboration methods in affective computing.
	2. Experimental comparisons of different collaboration strategies.
	3. Discussion on key challenges and future research directions in this area.

**Result:** The study identifies various collaboration strategies that enhance robustness and adaptability in affective reasoning, demonstrating improved interactions and potential applications.

**Limitations:** Cognitive limitations of LLMs in affective reasoning, including cultural nuances and hallucination issues.

**Conclusion:** LLM-based collaboration in Affective Computing can pave the way for applications that better mimic human-like emotional and rational intelligence.

**Abstract:** Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2) Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social intelligence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed mdok approach for robust detection of AI-generated text using fine-tuned smaller LLMs.
	2. Achieved outstanding results in binary and multiclass detection tasks.
	3. Addressed robustness issues with out-of-distribution data.

**Result:** The approach demonstrated remarkable performance in both binary detection and multiclass classification in the Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method shows promise in improving the detection of machine-generated texts, particularly in contexts involving human-AI collaboration.

**Abstract:** The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g., plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To diagnose biases and their mitigations in LLMs through training interventions such as early stopping.

**Method:** Introduction of new metrics (Average Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts) to evaluate and monitor fairness dynamics during pre-training on the WinoBias dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of new fairness metrics
	2. Findings on trade-off between accuracy and fairness
	3. Insights on bias evolution during LLM training

**Result:** Pythia-6.9b exhibits gender bias, being more confident in predicting male occupations and showing a significant trade-off between accuracy and fairness through early stopping.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Monitoring fairness dynamics is crucial as larger models can exhibit more bias, necessitating interventions to improve fairness without severely impacting accuracy.

**Abstract:** We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that (1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping, Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not specified.

**Motivation:** To improve generalization and robustness in table reasoning tasks beyond the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches.

**Method:** We apply reinforcement learning to train the Reasoning-Table model, implementing rigorous data preprocessing, reward design, and training strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	2. Significantly outperforms SFT methods with simple rule-based rewards
	3. Unified training strategy enhances model performance across tasks.

**Result:** Reasoning-Table achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing larger proprietary models on table reasoning benchmarks and excelling in text-to-SQL tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Reasoning-Table demonstrates enhanced generalization and robustness capabilities, setting new benchmarks in table reasoning.

**Abstract:** Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks. Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching 68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization capabilities and robustness.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal large language models, self-reflection, reinforcement learning, reasoning, feedback

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Proposes a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning framework to enhance reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Multimodal large language models struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require self-reflection and correction. Current reflection methods are inadequate, necessitating a more effective approach to enhance reasoning capabilities and feedback quality.

**Method:** The proposed framework, SRPO, consists of two stages: (1) constructing a reflection-focused dataset guided by an advanced MLLM to foster learning of reasoning and self-reflection, and (2) implementing a novel reward mechanism to promote meaningful reflections while minimizing redundancy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SRPO framework for enhancing MLLM reasoning.
	2. Creation of a reflection-focused dataset using advanced MLLM guidance.
	3. Development of a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework.

**Result:** Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks (MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, MMMU-Pro) show that SRPO significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SRPO framework effectively enhances reasoning in multimodal LLMs, enabling improved performance in complex tasks requiring reflection and self-correction.

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy.

### [235] [Tug-of-war between idiom's figurative and literal meanings in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01723)

*Soyoung Oh, Xinting Huang, Mathis Pink, Michael Hahn, Vera Demberg*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** idioms, language models, mechanistic interpretability, transformers, figurative language

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how a large pretrained transformer model, LLama3.2-1B-base, processes idioms, focusing on the duality between figurative and literal meanings.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how language models interpret idioms is crucial due to their complex meanings that differ from literal interpretations.

**Method:** The study utilizes mechanistic interpretability to analyze the attention mechanisms and pathways within the transformer model during idiom processing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Mechanistic analysis of idiom processing in transformers
	2. Identification of attention heads for figurative and literal meaning
	3. Insights into pathways used by language models for understanding idioms

**Result:** The model shows that it can boost the figurative meaning of idioms while suppressing their literal interpretation through specific attention heads and pathways.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings offer mechanistic insights into how autoregressive transformers achieve idiom comprehension, suggesting a dual processing route for either figurative or literal interpretations.

**Abstract:** Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an autoregressive transformer.

**Conclusion:** Common Corpus serves as a critical infrastructure for open science in LLM research.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science research in LLMs.

### [237] [Benford's Curse: Tracing Digit Bias to Numerical Hallucination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01734)

*Jiandong Shao, Yao Lu, Jianfei Yang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Benford's Law, Numerical Reasoning, Digit Bias, Neural Pruning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates how biases in digit generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) stem from the statistical patterns in their pretraining data, specifically in relation to Benford's Law.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs often struggle with basic numerical problems, leading to incorrect outputs. Understanding the source of this bias can improve LLM performance in numerical reasoning tasks.

**Method:** The study analyzes digit frequencies in the OLMo2 pretraining corpus to see if they follow Benford's law. An evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed digits is constructed across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection were employed to identify the origins of digit bias.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of digit bias in LLMs relating to Benford's Law.
	2. Development of a benchmark for evaluating LLM numerical reasoning.
	3. Evidence that neuron pruning can correct digit generation bias.

**Result:** Leading open-source LLMs exhibit a digit bias that aligns with Benford's law. The bias is found predominantly in a small group of highly selective feed-forward neurons, and pruning these neurons helps reduce imbalanced digit generation and correct some erroneous outputs.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the analysis of specific LLMs and the corpus used; further examination with other models and datasets is necessary.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight a critical connection between corpus statistics and the failures of LLMs in numerical tasks, suggesting potential pathways for addressing hallucinations in such contexts.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems, producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

### [238] [Thinking in Character: Advancing Role-Playing Agents with Role-Aware Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01748)

*Yihong Tang, Kehai Chen, Muyun Yang, Zhengyu Niu, Jing Li, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Role-Playing Agents, Role-Aware Reasoning, Human-Computer Interaction, Dialogue Generation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method to enhance Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) by addressing issues of attention diversion and style drift in dialogue generation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper highlights the limitations of current RPAs that rely on explicit dialogue data and lack human-like reasoning, which prevents deeper emotional engagement and consistent character portrayal.

**Method:** The RAR method consists of two key components: Role Identity Activation (RIA), which uses character profiles to guide the model's attention during reasoning, and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO), which aligns the reasoning style with the character and scene using LRM distillation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method
	2. Role Identity Activation (RIA) for guiding attention
	3. Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO) for mitigating style drift

**Result:** Experiments show that the RAR method significantly improves RPA performance by effectively addressing both attention diversion and style drift.

**Limitations:** The efficacy of the proposed method may be limited by the quality of character profiles and scene descriptions used in training.

**Conclusion:** The proposed RAR method enhances RPAs' ability to maintain role consistency and express character-specific styles in dialogue.

**Abstract:** The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes, resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing attention diversion and style drift.

**Result:** The methodology proposed successfully isolated Kwak'wala text from images and produced high-quality transcriptions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the potential of advanced OCR methods to support language revitalization and poses necessary adaptations for effective implementation.

**Abstract:** Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper, we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods, language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text, along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality transcription.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the accuracy and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive scenarios by integrating external knowledge resources like knowledge graphs and enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex queries.

**Method:** iQUEST decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions and uses a Graph Neural Network to incorporate 2-hop neighbor information, providing a structured reasoning framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of iQUEST framework for iterative query decomposition
	2. Integration of Graph Neural Networks to enhance multi-hop reasoning
	3. Consistent improvement in KBQA performance across benchmark datasets

**Result:** Experiments show that iQUEST consistently improves performance across four benchmark datasets and four different LLMs in KBQA tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** iQUEST enhances multi-hop reasoning in KBQA, enabling more effective exploration of knowledge graphs and improving accuracy in responses for complex queries.

**Abstract:** While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The proposed HCE framework enhances subjective evaluation methodologies and supports the advancement of LLMs in research and practical applications.

**Abstract:** Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized, automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical scenarios.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The effectiveness of grammar books in aiding translation for extremely low-resource languages remains unclear, motivating an investigation into their role and challenges.

**Method:** The study decomposes the translation process into grammar rule retrieval and application, using the ZhuangRules dataset to evaluate the impact of representing grammar rules as code functions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ZhuangRules dataset for grammar rules
	2. Decomposition of translation into retrieval and application steps
	3. Demonstrated efficacy of using code functions for grammar rules

**Result:** The analysis shows that grammar rule retrieval is a bottleneck and that representing rules as code significantly enhances both retrieval and application, leading to a 13.1% improvement in BLEU scores for translations.

**Limitations:** The study is primarily focused on low-resource languages and may not generalize to well-resourced languages or other translation methods.

**Conclusion:** Utilizing code representations for grammar rules can improve low-resource language translations more effectively than traditional rule application methods.

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study enhances understanding of information warfare dynamics and proposes techniques for future research on social media's influence in military conflicts.

**Abstract:** The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war, February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust, whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies on social media influence in military conflicts.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the ideological biases of two large language models, DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) and ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC), in responding to questions derived from Chinese-language news.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the bias present in large language models, particularly in the context of geopolitical alignment, and fill the gap in existing research regarding cross-lingual comparisons of model biases.

**Method:** A novel corpus of 1,200 questions was generated from Chinese-language news, with responses analyzed from both models using a hybrid evaluation method that combined GPT-4 scoring with human annotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First direct cross-lingual comparison of PRC-aligned and non-PRC language models
	2. Development of a unique corpus for evaluating LLM biases
	3. Demonstration of bias variation by language in responses from LLMs

**Result:** DeepSeek-R1 exhibited significantly higher rates of propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, with bias levels varying across languages.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a specific set of models and may not represent the entire landscape of LLM biases.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights that model biases are not limited to political content but also affect cultural and lifestyle topics, revealing the pervasive nature of ideologically motivated content generation.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct, cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore, such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

**Motivation:** The objective is to assess the pedagogical abilities of AI-powered tutors through accurate mistake identification and location in educational dialogues.

**Method:** The system employs a fine-tuned MPNet model with class-weighted cross-entropy loss and grouped cross-validation (10 folds), along with a hard-voting ensemble of models for improved accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an ensemble approach to AI tutor evaluation
	2. Use of grouped cross-validation for effective data management
	3. Comprehensive performance analysis including confusion matrices and visualizations

**Result:** Achieved exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for mistake identification and 0.5543 for mistake location on the official test set.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings aim to enhance the reliability of tutor response evaluation systems in educational settings and provide useful insights for future developments.

**Abstract:** We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the neglect of professional humor in LLM alignment with human values, which is crucial for AI applications in workplaces.

**Method:** A dataset of professional humor statements was created, including features for evaluating the appropriateness of humor, followed by an evaluation of five LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a professional humor dataset
	2. Evaluation of LLMs on humor appropriateness
	3. Identification of features for determining humor appropriateness

**Result:** The evaluation revealed that LLMs frequently struggle to accurately judge the appropriateness of professional humor statements.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on five LLMs and may not generalize across all AI models or humor contexts.

**Conclusion:** Improving LLM's understanding of professional humor is necessary for better alignment with human workplace values.

**Abstract:** With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the quality and effectiveness of citation evaluations in information-seeking systems.

**Method:** The authors introduce CiteEval as a framework focused on fine-grained citation assessment, complemented by the CiteBench benchmark for high-quality human annotations and CiteEval-Auto for model-based evaluation metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CiteEval framework for detailed citation assessments
	2. Creation of CiteBench benchmark with human annotations
	3. Development of CiteEval-Auto metrics for automatic evaluation of citations

**Result:** CiteEval-Auto metrics show strong correlation with human judgments and outperform existing metrics in capturing the complexities of citation quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CiteEval provides a principled, scalable approach for evaluating citation quality that can significantly improve model-generated citations.

**Abstract:** Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context, encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** code-switching, large language models, evaluation methodology, bilingualism, natural language processing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a methodology to evaluate code-switching in large language models (LLMs) by comparing probabilities assigned to naturally occurring sentences and manipulated variants.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to address the lack of effective evaluation methodologies for assessing how large language models engage in code-switching as bilinguals do.

**Method:** An intervention based on minimal pairs of code-switching, involving naturally occurring sentences and minimally manipulated variants, was implemented. Data was collected for 11 language pairs with up to 1,000 pairs per language.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a robust evaluation methodology for code-switching in LLMs.
	2. Empirical evidence showing that larger models outperform smaller ones in recognizing naturally occurring code-switching.
	3. Insights into how closed-class words affect LLM behavior regarding code-switching.

**Result:** Experiments show that bilinguals prefer the naturally occurring code-switching sentences, and larger LLMs assign higher probabilities to these sentences compared to variants, especially for pairs with manipulated closed-class words.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to 11 language pairs, which may not represent all possible bilingual CS phenomena.

**Conclusion:** The findings support theoretical claims about code-switching and demonstrate that LLMs can exhibit similar patterns to bilinguals in their preferences.

**Abstract:** There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a large-scale experiment demonstrating that syntax alone can effectively predict code-switching (CS) locations in bilingual sentences.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate whether the patterns of code-switching can be solely explained by syntactic structures across multiple languages and phenomena, extending beyond isolated studies.

**Method:** The study designed a large-scale, multi-language experiment where a system predicts code-switching points using only syntactic information, allowing for systematic comparison with bilingual human performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Establishes a large-scale experiment in code-switching analysis
	2. Proves that syntax is sufficient for predicting bilingual switch points
	3. Demonstrates generalization of syntactic patterns to unseen pairs

**Result:** The results show that the automatic system can distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of code-switching using syntax, achieving accuracy comparable to bilingual humans.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support the hypothesis that syntactic patterns alone are sufficient to explain and predict language switching behavior in bilingual speakers and generalize across unseen language pairs.

**Abstract:** The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs.

**TL;DR:** CONFETTI is a benchmark for evaluating function-calling in large language models through complex conversational scenarios.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks do not adequately assess LLMs in intricate conversational scenarios, particularly concerning their function-calling capabilities and response quality.

**Method:** The study introduces CONFETTI, which includes 109 human-simulated conversations with 313 user turns targeting complex conversational dynamics. It employs off-policy turn-level evaluation and includes dialog act annotations to evaluate agent responses across various LLMs using 86 APIs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CONFETTI benchmark for LLM assessment
	2. In-depth analysis of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios
	3. Identification of performance limitations in function-calling across models

**Result:** Top models evaluated include Nova Pro, Claude Sonnet v3.5, and Llama 3.1 405B, with noted challenges in handling long conversations and chained function-calls across the models.

**Limitations:** The performance of models on chained function-calls remains inadequate, indicating a need for enhancements in this area.

**Conclusion:** While some LLMs can manage longer conversations and multiple APIs, performance on chained function-calls is limited, suggesting the need for improved function-calling efficiency in future models.

**Abstract:** We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models (LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the challenges of achieving true omni-modal language models (OLMs) that can effectively process and reason over diverse input modalities, analyzing the impact of modality extension, model merging, and knowledge sharing.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand and overcome the limitations of current omni-modal language models, particularly in their ability to generalize across different input modalities and maintain strong language processing capabilities.

**Method:** The authors conducted extensive experiments to assess the effects of modality extension, the integration of modality-specific models through merging, and the comparison of knowledge sharing methods in achieving omni-modality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of modality extension's impact on language capabilities
	2. Investigation of model merging for omni-modality
	3. Comparison of knowledge sharing techniques for improving generalization

**Result:** The findings reveal trade-offs between maintaining core language abilities and achieving effective omni-modality. The study shows that current methods struggle with generalization and performance on multi-modal inputs.

**Limitations:** Current methods are limited in their ability to generalize across modality pairs and perform well on multi-modal inputs, indicating a need for further advancements.

**Conclusion:** Achieving true omni-modality with existing models is challenging, and while some techniques show promise, they also highlight significant limitations that need to be addressed.

**Abstract:** Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models, especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models, where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing single-cell LLMs which struggle with integrating spatial information and considering cell-cell interactions, thereby enhancing biological relationship analysis.

**Method:** Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices to pair spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells for multi-sentence representations, enabling better learning of cellular interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-sentence approach for single-cell data
	2. Integration of spatial information into language models
	3. Demonstrated improvements in classification accuracy and clinical predictions

**Result:** Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on IMC datasets, achieving a 5.98% improvement in cell-type classification and a 4.18% enhancement in clinical status prediction for diabetes data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework significantly improves the interpretability and performance of single-cell analyses by combining spatial context with single-cell expression data.

**Abstract:** Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for improved evaluation frameworks that prioritize cultural competence in addition to technical performance.

**Abstract:** This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets, identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490 challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1. Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant variations in model performance across different domains, with particular challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%, showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language, and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of current masked diffusion models (MDMs) and autoregressive (AR) models in language generation, particularly in inference-time efficiency.

**Method:** Fusion of AR and MDM paradigms to create Eso-LMs, with a focus on integrating KV caching and an optimized sampling schedule to boost inference speed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First integration of KV caching for MDMs while preserving parallel generation
	2. Achieves new state of the art benchmarks for language modeling
	3. Significantly improves inference speed compared to previous models

**Result:** Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on language modeling benchmarks, achieving up to 65x faster inference than standard MDMs and 4x faster than prior semi-autoregressive approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Eso-LMs successfully enhance the capabilities of language models by improving inference efficiency and maintaining robust performance on benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work, we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches.

**Motivation:** The need for robust evaluation of reward models used in language model training, to ensure they effectively capture user preferences and improve various tasks.

**Method:** Introduction of RewardBench 2, a multi-skill benchmark using new human-generated prompts for evaluating accuracy and correlating it with downstream task performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-skill benchmark (RewardBench 2) for reward models in NLP.
	2. Establishment of rigorous evaluation practices through new human prompts.
	3. Demonstration of the correlation between benchmark performance and downstream model usage.

**Result:** Existing models show an average score about 20 points lower on RewardBench 2 than on the first RewardBench, suggesting it presents a tougher evaluation standard related to downstream task effectiveness.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of reward models was found to be lower on this new benchmark, indicating challenges in model alignment.

**Conclusion:** RewardBench 2 aims to facilitate better evaluation practices for reward models in the language model community, ultimately leading to improved model performance in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains. The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices. In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like proximal policy optimization.

**Motivation:** To understand the mechanisms behind Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its impact on reasoning in LLMs.

**Method:** The study analyzes token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and examines how these patterns evolve during RLVR training, particularly focusing on high-entropy tokens known as forking tokens.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced an analysis method focusing on token entropy patterns in RLVR.
	2. Demonstrated the critical role of high-entropy tokens in improving LLM reasoning performance.
	3. Achieved significant performance improvements by optimizing only 20% of tokens during training.

**Result:** The findings indicate that restricting policy gradient updates to high-entropy forking tokens significantly improves RLVR performance on multiple Qwen models, confirming a strong scaling trend.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research suggests that the performance of RLVR can be enhanced by optimizing the high-entropy tokens, which dictate reasoning pathways in LLMs, offering a new perspective on RLVR and its mechanisms.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.

	3. Plug-and-play integration with existing architectures without the need for additional labeled data.

**Result:** Self-ensemble demonstrates improved performance on multi-choice question-answering tasks across three different LLMs and datasets, successfully addressing the confidence distortion issue.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The experimental results indicate that Self-ensemble is effective in overcoming the limitations of confidence distortion in LLMs, outperforming standard inference and baseline methods.

**Abstract:** Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** As web browsing agents improve, there is a need to evaluate their capabilities on more complex and tedious tasks that require greater cognitive effort from users.

**Method:** WebChoreArena includes three key challenge categories: Massive Memory tasks, Calculation tasks, and Long-Term Memory tasks, built on existing WebArena environments to ensure reproducibility.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark for complex web tasks
	2. Emphasis on reproducibility in benchmark design
	3. Identification of LLM performance gaps in challenging tasks

**Result:** Experimental results show significant performance improvements in LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro on WebChoreArena tasks, indicating its effectiveness in measuring agent progress.

**Limitations:** Current LLMs still show substantial room for improvement across WebChoreArena tasks compared to general browsing performance.

**Conclusion:** WebChoreArena can better assess state-of-the-art LLM advancements but also highlights existing limitations in task performance.

**Abstract:** Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current RAG systems are resource-intensive and often generate hallucinated content. There is a need for more efficient models that maintain factual consistency.

**Method:** DRAG uses evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, aligning smaller model predictions with structured knowledge to mitigate hallucination and improve accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Experimental evaluations show DRAG outperforms MiniRAG by up to 27.7% while preserving efficiency and reliability in smaller models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DRAG provides a resource-efficient method for deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small LLMs, addressing both accuracy and size concerns.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a theoretical framework based on category theory to describe in-context learning and behavior of large language models (LLMs) during interaction with users, showing that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To formally describe the properties and behavior of LLMs and improve the effectiveness of prompt generation strategies like meta-prompting.

**Method:** The authors propose a framework rooted in category theory to analyze in-context learning and to compare various meta-prompting approaches in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A theoretical framework based on category theory for LLM behavior analysis
	2. Formal insights on task agnosticity and prompt equivalence
	3. Demonstration that meta-prompting is superior to basic prompting

**Result:** The framework provides formal results highlighting task agnosticity and equivalence among different meta-prompting approaches, revealing that meta-prompting generally yields better outputs compared to basic prompting.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results suggest that a structured theoretical approach can enhance our understanding and effectiveness of LLM prompting techniques.

**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Unlike traditional learners, LLMs cannot use back-propagation to obtain feedback, and condition their output in situ in a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts, also known as meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. However, they do not formally describe the properties and behavior of the LLMs themselves. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe ICL and LLM behavior when interacting with users. Our framework allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Using our framework and experimental results we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high computational demands of large language models by transferring their capabilities to more efficient student models while considering input preferences that affect in-context learning.

**Method:** BiAlign introduces a ranking loss to align the input preferences between student and teacher models, in addition to token-level output alignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) method for model distillation
	2. Incorporation of a ranking loss to align input preferences between models
	3. Demonstration of consistent performance improvements over existing methods in multiple tasks

**Result:** BiAlign consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks, including language understanding, reasoning, and coding.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively enhances the few-shot generalization capabilities of student models by utilizing input preference alignment.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive few-shot generalization on many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). Despite their success in showing such emergent abilities, the scale and complexity of larger models also lead to unprecedentedly high computational demands and deployment challenges. In reaction, researchers explore transferring the powerful capabilities of larger models to more efficient and compact models by typically aligning the output of smaller (student) models with that of larger (teacher) models. Existing methods either train student models on the generated outputs of teacher models or imitate their token-level probability distributions. However, these distillation methods pay little to no attention to the input, which also plays a crucial role in ICL. Based on the finding that the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of demonstration examples, we propose Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) to fully leverage the models' preferences for ICL examples to improve the ICL abilities of student models. Specifically, we introduce the alignment of input preferences between student and teacher models by incorporating a novel ranking loss, in addition to aligning the token-level output distribution. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that BiAlign can consistently outperform existing baselines on a variety of tasks involving language understanding, reasoning, and coding.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper examines gender biases in multilingual text-to-image generation models and proposes a benchmark (MAGBIG) to study these biases, revealing that biases persist and vary across languages, with limited effectiveness of prompt engineering to mitigate them.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate and highlight gender biases present in multilingual text-to-image generation models, which has implications for their use in broader applications.

**Method:** The study employs a novel benchmark called MAGBIG to analyze gender bias in multilingual T2I models by constructing multilingual prompts asking for portraits based on specific occupations or traits.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed the MAGBIG benchmark for studying gender biases in multilingual T2I models.
	2. Highlighted significant gender biases in multilingual models that differ across languages.
	3. Investigated prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation, showing their limitations.

**Result:** The findings indicate that multilingual models exhibit significant gender biases similar to monolingual models, with notable variations in behavior across different languages.

**Limitations:** The prompt engineering strategies explored have limited success and can result in poorer text-to-image alignment.

**Conclusion:** There is a need for further research into diverse representations and the steering of multilingual models to address and reduce biases in image generation.

**Abstract:** Text-to-image generation models have recently achieved astonishing results in image quality, flexibility, and text alignment, and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. Through improvements in multilingual abilities, a larger community now has access to this technology. However, our results show that multilingual models suffer from significant gender biases just as monolingual models do. Furthermore, the natural expectation that multilingual models will provide similar results across languages does not hold up. Instead, there are important differences between languages. We propose a novel benchmark, MAGBIG, intended to foster research on gender bias in multilingual models. We use MAGBIG to investigate the effect of multilingualism on gender bias in T2I models. To this end, we construct multilingual prompts requesting portraits of people with a certain occupation or trait. Our results show that not only do models exhibit strong gender biases but they also behave differently across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, such as indirect, neutral formulations, to mitigate these biases. Unfortunately, these approaches have limited success and result in worse text-to-image alignment. Consequently, we call for more research into diverse representations across languages in image generators, as well as into steerability to address biased model behavior.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates whether Large Language Models can perform multi-hop reasoning by analyzing their responses to complex prompts involving indirect references to bridge entities.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore the latent reasoning pathways in Large Language Models when prompted with complex queries, particularly focusing on their ability to complete prompts that require multi-hop reasoning.

**Method:** The research involves testing LLMs with prompts that mention bridge entities indirectly and measuring their recall and utilization of information related to these entities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of latent multi-hop reasoning pathways in LLMs
	2. Empirical evidence showing dependency on prompt structure
	3. Observation of scaling effects relating to model size and reasoning performance

**Result:** The authors found substantial evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning in LLMs for certain prompt types, with strong retrieval for the first hop but moderate results for the full traversal; scaling trends were observed with model size.

**Limitations:** The evidence for the second hop's reasoning was moderate and context-dependent; scaling effects were inconsistent for different reasoning hops.

**Conclusion:** Results indicate both challenges and opportunities in enhancing LLM capabilities for multi-hop reasoning tasks; the findings highlight the complexity in how LLMs utilize knowledge depending on prompt structure.

**Abstract:** We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as "The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is". We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies "the singer of 'Superstition'" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark to assess social biases in LLM-generated content across demographic groups, finding significant gender and intersectional biases.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limited research on biases in language agency within LLM-generated content.

**Method:** The authors developed the LABE benchmark to evaluate biases by analyzing agency levels in LLM outputs across various demographic groups on three text generation tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LABE benchmark for evaluating language agency biases in LLMs.
	2. Identification of significant social biases in LLM-generated content across gender and intersectionality.
	3. Development of the Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR) strategy to improve bias correction.

**Result:** LABE revealed that LLM outputs exhibit greater gender bias than human-written texts and higher intersectional biases. Proposed Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR) was found to be more effective than traditional methods.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on three specific text generation tasks and certain LLMs, which may not generalize to all contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for better bias mitigation strategies in LLMs and suggest that MSR offers a promising approach.

**Abstract:** Social biases can manifest in language agency. However, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, falling short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE tests for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. (3) Prompt-based mitigation is unstable and frequently leads to bias exacerbation. Based on our observations, we propose Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR), a novel bias mitigation strategy that leverages an agency classifier to identify and selectively revise parts of generated texts that demonstrate communal traits. Empirical results prove MSR to be more effective and reliable than prompt-based mitigation method, showing a promising research direction.

**Motivation:** Understanding whether LLMs benefit more from relevant self-generated examples compared to irrelevant ones in analogy-based problem-solving.

**Method:** Systematic exploration through extensive experiments on diverse reasoning tasks, comparing the effectiveness of self-generated examples based on their relevance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the effectiveness of relevant examples in LLM reasoning tasks
	2. Designs two novel methods that enhance performance
	3. Provides insights into LLMs' analogical reasoning capabilities

**Result:** Self-generated random examples provided comparable or better performance on certain tasks, notably a 4% boost on GSM8K using biological examples.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The accuracy of self-generated examples is critical, leading to the design of two novel methods that demonstrate improved performance and reduced inference costs.

**Abstract:** Analogical reasoning is a unique ability of humans to address unfamiliar challenges by transferring strategies from relevant past experiences. One key finding in psychology is that compared with irrelevant past experiences, recalling relevant ones can help humans better handle new tasks. Coincidentally, the NLP community has also recently found that self-generating relevant examples in the context can help large language models (LLMs) better solve a given problem than hand-crafted prompts. However, it is yet not clear whether relevance is the key factor eliciting such capability, i.e., can LLMs benefit more from self-generated relevant examples than irrelevant ones? In this work, we systematically explore whether LLMs can truly perform analogical reasoning on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we show that self-generated random examples can surprisingly achieve comparable or even better performance on certain tasks, e.g., 4% performance boost on GSM8K with random biological examples. We find that the accuracy of self-generated examples is the key factor and subsequently design two novel methods with improved performance and significantly reduced inference costs. Overall, we aim to advance a deeper understanding of LLM analogical reasoning and hope this work stimulates further research in the design of self-generated contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MoTE framework
	2. Combination of reasoning chains and expert mixtures
	3. Demonstration of enhanced safety in smaller LLMs

**Result:** Experimental results show that MoTE enhances model safety, increases jailbreak resistance, and improves over-refusal capabilities, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively improves the alignment and safety of LLMs, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional approaches even in smaller models.

**Abstract:** As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, aligning these models with human values remains a significant challenge. Recent studies show that reasoning abilities contribute significantly to model safety, while integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures can further enhance alignment. In this work, we address a fundamental question: How to effectively incorporate reasoning abilities and MoE architectures into self-alignment process in LLMs? We propose Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE), a novel framework that synergistically combines reasoning chains and expert mixtures to improve self-alignments. From a data perspective, MoTE employs a structured reasoning chain comprising four key stages: Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, Safe Answer, and Safety Checking. This approach enhances safety through multi-step reasoning and proves effective even for smaller and less powerful LLMs (e.g., 7B models). From an architectural perspective, MoTE adopts a multi-LoRA framework with step-level routing, where each expert is dedicated to a specific reasoning step. This design eliminates the need for balance losses, ensures stable training, and supports adaptive inference lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that MoTE significantly improves model safety, jailbreak resistance, and over-refusal capabilities, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1 model.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like multiple-choice questions raises concerns about biases affecting their decision-making, specifically the anchored bias observed in GPT-2 models.

**Method:** Utilizing the mechanistic interpretability approach, the study examines the MLP layers and attention heads of GPT-2 models, employing the 'logit lens' method to track and modify specific value vectors responsible for the detrimentally biased preference for the first choice.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias in GPT-2 models during MCQ tasks.
	2. Proposes minimal-intervention strategies to mitigate bias and improve prediction accuracy.
	3. Provides accessible code for further research and validation.

**Result:** The intervention succeeds in modifying the biased preference for the first option, resulting in improved overall prediction accuracy in MCQs for GPT-2 across various datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Targeted interventions can effectively neutralize anchored bias in GPT-2 models, enhancing their robustness and making the models more reliable for multiple-choice tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

**Motivation:** The goal is to enhance information accessibility in specialized domains, particularly in low/mid-resource languages, by generating domain-specific lexicons.

**Method:** The proposed model has domain-specific and domain-generic layers, which encode information and operate via a learnable routing technique.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-domain lexicon generation model for Indian languages
	2. Release of a benchmark dataset with over 75K translation pairs
	3. Demonstration of model efficacy in low/mid-resource language settings

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple domains, as well as human evaluation showing competent performance on unseen languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The model contributes to the field by providing a scalable solution for domain-specific lexicon generation, with an accompanying benchmark dataset for future research.

**Abstract:** Lexicon or dictionary generation across domains has the potential for societal impact, as it can potentially enhance information accessibility for a diverse user base while preserving language identity. Prior work in the field primarily focuses on bilingual lexical induction, which deals with word alignments using mapping or corpora-based approaches. However, these approaches do not cater to domain-specific lexicon generation that consists of domain-specific terminology. This task becomes particularly important in specialized medical, engineering, and other technical domains, owing to the highly infrequent usage of the terms and scarcity of data involving domain-specific terms especially for low/mid-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a new model to generate dictionary words for $6$ Indian languages in the multi-domain setting. Our model consists of domain-specific and domain-generic layers that encode information, and these layers are invoked via a learnable routing technique. We also release a new benchmark dataset consisting of >75K translation pairs across 6 Indian languages spanning 8 diverse domains.We conduct both zero-shot and few-shot experiments across multiple domains to show the efficacy of our proposed model in generalizing to unseen domains and unseen languages. Additionally, we also perform a post-hoc human evaluation on unseen languages. The source code and dataset is present at https://github.com/Atulkmrsingh/lexgen.

**Limitations:** The findings are based on experiments conducted in controlled environments which may not fully represent real-world applications.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of information interactions in CoT prompting and propose a solution for improving CoT quality through additional information recall.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.

**TL;DR:** This paper critiques the use of multiple-choice questions to evaluate the clinical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain, highlighting discrepancies in performance between models and physicians.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the effectiveness of using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for evaluating clinical understanding in LLMs, and to address the issue of overestimation of true clinical reasoning abilities based on pattern recognition.

**Method:** A fictional medical benchmark was created featuring an imaginary organ, the Glianorex. Textbooks and MCQs in English and French were generated using leading LLMs, and various models were evaluated in a zero-shot setting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a fictional benchmark to test LLM capabilities in clinical reasoning.
	2. Demonstrated the limitations of current MCQ evaluations in measuring true clinical understanding.
	3. Showed significant differences in performance between models and human physicians.

**Result:** Models achieved an average score of 64% on the benchmark, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models performed better than base models in English but not in French, and models often relied on shallow cues and hallucinations.

**Limitations:** The benchmark used fictional content, which may limit the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Standard MCQ evaluations may not effectively measure clinical reasoning in LLMs, indicating a need for more substantive assessment methods in the medical field.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical domain and are often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) modeled on exams like the USMLE. However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice. These results suggest that standard MCQ-based evaluations may not effectively measure clinical reasoning and highlight the need for more robust, clinically meaningful assessment methods for LLMs.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework for adapting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in a Model-as-a-Service setting, enhancing performance by querying with multiple prompts.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of single-prompt approaches for adapting PLMs in downstream tasks, particularly in the context of few-shot learning where data scarcity is a concern.

**Method:** The Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework queries PLMs with multiple different prompts for each sample, allowing for the extraction of multiple hidden states and class scores for improved decoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework.
	2. Development of two decoding strategies: optimal transport for hidden states and calibrated decoding for class scores.
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

**Result:** The MPD framework demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various natural language understanding tasks under few-shot conditions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The multi-prompting approach reduces dependence on single prompts, enhances knowledge extraction from PLMs, and effectively addresses issues related to data scarcity in few-shot settings.

**Abstract:** Recent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) usually only provide users with the inference APIs, namely the emerging Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) setting. To adapt MaaS PLMs to downstream tasks without accessing their parameters and gradients, some existing methods focus on the output-side adaptation of PLMs, viewing the PLM as an encoder and then optimizing a task-specific decoder for decoding the output hidden states and class scores of the PLM. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they only use a single prompt to query PLMs for decoding, leading to a heavy reliance on the quality of the adopted prompt. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework for MaaS adaptation. The core idea is to query PLMs with multiple different prompts for each sample, thereby obtaining multiple output hidden states and class scores for subsequent decoding. Such multi-prompting decoding paradigm can simultaneously mitigate reliance on the quality of a single prompt, alleviate the issue of data scarcity under the few-shot setting, and provide richer knowledge extracted from PLMs. Specifically, we propose two decoding strategies: multi-prompting decoding with optimal transport for hidden states and calibrated decoding for class scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language understanding datasets under the few-shot setting.

**TL;DR:** RAEmoLLM introduces a retrieval augmented LLM framework for cross-domain misinformation detection, leveraging affective information without fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Misinformation detection is critical across various fields, but existing methods are resource-intensive and do not充分利用情感特征.

**Method:** The proposed framework consists of three modules: index construction using emotional LLMs for affective embeddings, a retrieval module to recommend example pairs, and an inference module utilizing these examples for processing target content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First retrieval augmented LLM framework for cross-domain misinformation detection
	2. Utilization of affective information to improve model performance
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing methods.

**Result:** RAEmoLLM significantly outperformed traditional few-shot methods on three misinformation benchmarks, with improvements of up to 31.18%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework enhances LLM performance in misinformation detection tasks without requiring fine-tuning, demonstrating the importance of affect-based retrieval.

**Abstract:** Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel method for parameter-efficient finetuning of language models by analyzing where in the model to apply finetuning, effectively reducing the costs associated with backpropagation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high costs of full finetuning in language models, focusing on both how and where to finetune is essential for efficiency.

**Method:** The authors propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations and estimate the gain of each layer in reducing loss, narrowing down the scope for effective finetuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a method for analyzing where to finetune in language models.
	2. Developed a formula for estimating layer contributions to loss reduction.
	3. Conducted extensive empirical validation across multiple LMs and datasets.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and efficiency, outperforming existing baselines in LM finetuning.

**Limitations:** The study may not address all aspects of finetuning and assumes the applicability of the method across models and tasks.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach is complementary to existing techniques like parameter-efficient finetuning methods, providing valuable insights into optimizing LM finetuning.

**Abstract:** Finetuning language models (LMs) is crucial for adapting the models to downstream data and tasks. However, full finetuning is usually costly. Existing work, such as parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT), often focuses on \textit{how to finetune} but neglects the issue of \textit{where to finetune}. As a pioneering work on reducing the cost of backpropagation (at the layer level) by answering where to finetune, we conduct a semantic analysis of the LM inference process. We first propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations (or loss). Then, using a derived formula of scaling law, we estimate the gain of each layer in reducing deviation (or loss). Further, we narrow down the scope for finetuning, and also, study the cost-benefit balance of LM finetuning. We perform extensive experiments across well-known LMs and datasets. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient, and outperforms the existing baselines. Our approach is orthogonal to other techniques for improving finetuning efficiency, such as PEFT methods, offering practical values on LM finetuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underexplored area of cross-lingual knowledge editing (KE) and provide a structured benchmark for evaluating this capability across languages.

**Method:** Systematic evaluation of cross-lingual knowledge editing using zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups with tailored metric-specific demonstrations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BMIKE-53 benchmark for cross-lingual IKE
	2. Evaluation across 53 languages using various setups
	3. Public availability of code and data

**Result:** Findings indicate that model scale and demonstration alignment are crucial for improving cross-lingual IKE performance, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly enhancing outcomes.

**Limitations:** Performance variability across languages, especially non-Latin scripts, affecting overall outcomes.

**Conclusion:** The performance variation is influenced by linguistic properties like script type, with non-Latin languages experiencing lower performance due to language confusion issues.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces BMIKE-53, a comprehensive benchmark for cross-lingual in-context knowledge editing (IKE) across 53 languages, unifying three knowledge editing (KE) datasets: zsRE, CounterFact, and WikiFactDiff. Cross-lingual KE, which requires knowledge edited in one language to generalize across others while preserving unrelated knowledge, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate IKE under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups, incorporating tailored metric-specific demonstrations. Our findings reveal that model scale and demonstration alignment critically govern cross-lingual IKE efficacy, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly improving performance. Linguistic properties, particularly script type, strongly influence performance variation across languages, with non-Latin languages underperforming due to issues like language confusion.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the emerging trend of using LLMs for NLP model evaluation, questioning the reliability and validity of such evaluations in light of observed disparities.

**Method:** An extensible collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations was developed, and 11 current LLMs were evaluated for their ability to replicate these annotations across different properties and data types.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of JUDGE-BENCH, a new collection of NLP datasets with human annotations.
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs, including both open-weight and proprietary models.
	3. Identification of variabilities in LLM performance as evaluators across tasks and datasets.

**Result:** The evaluations revealed significant variance in LLM performance, indicating that while some models are effective evaluators for certain tasks, overall reliability varies based on evaluation property and type of language generated.

**Limitations:** The study's findings may not be universally applicable across all NLP tasks.

**Conclusion:** LLMs should not be solely relied upon for evaluations without thorough validation against human judgments, given the observed variabilities.

**Abstract:** There is an increasing trend towards evaluating NLP models with LLMs instead of human judgments, raising questions about the validity of these evaluations, as well as their reproducibility in the case of proprietary models. We provide JUDGE-BENCH, an extensible collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations covering a broad range of evaluated properties and types of data, and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs, covering both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show substantial variance across models and datasets. Models are reliable evaluators on some tasks, but overall display substantial variability depending on the property being evaluated, the expertise level of the human judges, and whether the language is human or model-generated. We conclude that LLMs should be carefully validated against human judgments before being used as evaluators.

**TL;DR:** Optimus is a distributed training system designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by reducing training time through innovative scheduling techniques.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current MLLM training systems show inefficiency due to GPU bubbles resulting from heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies, barring effective training and increasing time costs.

**Method:** Optimus introduces a distributed training approach that involves scheduling encoder computations during LLM training to reduce inefficiencies. It utilizes separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM and employs a bubble scheduling algorithm to maintain data dependencies while optimizing overall training time.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Optimus, a distributed training system for MLLMs
	2. Development of a novel bubble scheduling algorithm
	3. Performance improvements validated through experiments in a production cluster

**Result:** Optimus achieves a notable acceleration of multimodal large language model training by 20.5%-21.3% with significant models (ViT-22B and GPT-175B) across a large cluster of GPUs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Optimus demonstrates that with strategic scheduling and optimization, MLLM training can be significantly expedited without compromising model architecture or data handling.

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended the success of large language models (LLMs) to multiple data types, such as image, text and audio, achieving significant performance in various domains, including multimodal translation, visual question answering and content generation. Nonetheless, existing systems are inefficient to train MLLMs due to substantial GPU bubbles caused by the heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies in 3D parallelism. This paper proposes Optimus, a distributed MLLM training system that reduces end-to-end MLLM training time. Optimus is based on our principled analysis that scheduling the encoder computation within the LLM bubbles can reduce bubbles in MLLM training. To make scheduling encoder computation possible for all GPUs, Optimus searches the separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM, and adopts a bubble scheduling algorithm to enable exploiting LLM bubbles without breaking the original data dependencies in the MLLM model architecture. We further decompose encoder layer computation into a series of kernels, and analyze the common bubble pattern of 3D parallelism to carefully optimize the sub-millisecond bubble scheduling, minimizing the overall training time. Our experiments in a production cluster show that Optimus accelerates MLLM training by 20.5%-21.3% with ViT-22B and GPT-175B model over 3072 GPUs compared to baselines.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critical analysis of over 2,000 LLM research articles
	2. Identification of emerging trends in LLM evaluation and ethics
	3. Recommendations for improving research methodology in LLM studies

**Result:** The study identifies trends such as fewer ethics disclaimers, a rise in LLMs as evaluators, and increased assertions of reasoning abilities without human validation. Conference checklists improve some research quality aspects but are insufficient alone.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** To improve LLM research quality, the authors recommend a balanced approach that integrates ethical considerations alongside rigorous methodology, underscoring the role of conference standards.

**Abstract:** We perform a critical examination of the scientific methodology behind contemporary large language model (LLM) research. For this we assess over 2,000 research works released between 2020 and 2024 based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility), and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour). We find multiple trends, such as declines in ethics disclaimers, a rise of LLMs as evaluators, and an increase on claims of LLM reasoning abilities without leveraging human evaluation. We note that conference checklists are effective at curtailing some of these issues, but balancing velocity and rigour in research cannot solely rely on these. We tie all these findings to findings from recent meta-reviews and extend recommendations on how to address what does, does not, and should work in LLM research.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of biomedical entity linking by addressing the limitations of training solely on positive samples.

**Method:** The model is initially trained to generate positive entity names, then updated using both correct and incorrect predictions through preference optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First framework for BioEL using negative samples
	2. Demonstrated increased accuracy in performance benchmarks
	3. Code and weights made publicly available

**Result:** The models improve upon previous best baselines by an average top-1 accuracy of 1.4% across five benchmarks and 1.7% with pre-training integration.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This framework shows significant performance improvements by effectively leveraging negative samples in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages of biomedical entity linking.

**Abstract:** Generative models have become widely used in biomedical entity linking (BioEL) due to their excellent performance and efficient memory usage. However, these models are usually trained only with positive samples, i.e., entities that match the input mention's identifier, and do not explicitly learn from hard negative samples, which are entities that look similar but have different meanings. To address this limitation, we introduce ANGEL (Learning from Negative Samples in Biomedical Generative Entity Linking), the first framework that trains generative BioEL models using negative samples. Specifically, a generative model is initially trained to generate positive entity names from the knowledge base for given input entities. Subsequently, both correct and incorrect outputs are gathered from the model's top-k predictions. Finally, the model is updated to prioritize the correct predictions through preference optimization. Our models outperform the previous best baseline models by up to an average top-1 accuracy of 1.4% on five benchmarks. When incorporating our framework into pre-training, the performance improvement increases further to 1.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/ANGEL.

**Motivation:** To assess LLMs' ability to handle scenarios with no valid answers while following instructions and exercising critical reasoning.

**Method:** Systematic evaluation across various tasks, including arithmetic and medical decision tasks, alongside human studies to investigate instruction-following biases and their impacts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel evaluation framework for LLMs balancing instruction and reasoning
	2. Evidence of aligned models defaulting to invalid choices
	3. Implications for human feedback datasets in model alignment

**Result:** Post-training aligned models often select invalid options; base models show improved refusal capabilities linked to size.

**Limitations:** Focus on specific tasks; effects may vary across different domains.

**Conclusion:** Alignment techniques that enhance helpfulness can impair reflective judgment, highlighting a tension between optimization and critical reasoning for real-world AI application.

**Abstract:** This work introduces a novel framework for evaluating LLMs' capacity to balance instruction-following with critical reasoning when presented with multiple-choice questions containing no valid answers. Through systematic evaluation across arithmetic, domain-specific knowledge, and high-stakes medical decision tasks, we demonstrate that post-training aligned models often default to selecting invalid options, while base models exhibit improved refusal capabilities that scale with model size. Our analysis reveals that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance helpfulness, can inadvertently impair models' reflective judgment--the ability to override default behaviors when faced with invalid options. We additionally conduct a parallel human study showing similar instruction-following biases, with implications for how these biases may propagate through human feedback datasets used in alignment. We provide extensive ablation studies examining the impact of model size, training techniques, and prompt engineering. Our findings highlight fundamental tensions between alignment optimization and preservation of critical reasoning capabilities, with important implications for developing more robust AI systems for real-world deployment.

**Motivation:** To improve interpretability and collaboration in critical text assessment tasks like fact-checking and peer review.

**Method:** The study introduces a structured reasoning framework (STRICTA) that models text assessment using a graph of interconnected reasoning steps based on causality theory, supported by expert interaction data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the STRICTA framework
	2. Creation of a large dataset for critical text assessment
	3. Insights into expert reasoning and LLM collaboration capabilities

**Result:** A dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps was created from 40 biomedical experts assessing over 20 papers, revealing insights into expert reasoning and LLM potential to assist in these workflows.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The STRICTA framework and dataset enable further exploration of collaborative reasoning between experts and AI in text assessment, particularly in peer review scenarios.

**Abstract:** Critical text assessment is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking, peer review, and essay grading. Yet, existing work treats critical text assessment as a black box problem, limiting interpretability and human-AI collaboration. To close this gap, we introduce Structured Reasoning In Critical Text Assessment (STRICTA), a novel specification framework to model text assessment as an explicit, step-wise reasoning process. STRICTA breaks down the assessment into a graph of interconnected reasoning steps drawing on causality theory (Pearl, 1995). This graph is populated based on expert interaction data and used to study the assessment process and facilitate human-AI collaboration. We formally define STRICTA and apply it in a study on biomedical paper assessment, resulting in a dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps from roughly 40 biomedical experts on more than 20 papers. We use this dataset to empirically study expert reasoning in critical text assessment, and investigate if LLMs are able to imitate and support experts within these workflows. The resulting tools and datasets pave the way for studying collaborative expert-AI reasoning in text assessment, in peer review and beyond.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first Chinese knowledge editing dataset (CKnowEdit)
	2. Collection of diverse linguistic knowledge tailored for Chinese

**Result:** Analysis of CKnowEdit reveals significant challenges in LLMs' mastery of Chinese, while providing evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques.

**Limitations:** Limited to Chinese language and may not generalize to other languages.

**Conclusion:** CKnowEdit serves as a foundational dataset for correcting errors in LLMs, offering insights into enhancing language models for Chinese linguistic competencies.

**Abstract:** Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for improved generation speed and diversity in existing audio captioning models which primarily rely on language backbones.

**Method:** DAC employs a diffusion model that integrates stochasticity and holistic context modeling for audio captioning tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a non-autoregressive diffusion model for audio captioning
	2. Demonstration of improved generation speed and diversity
	3. Establishment of a framework for unified multimodal generative tasks

**Result:** DAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in caption quality and significantly outperforms existing models in generation speed and diversity.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DAC shows the potential for integrating text generation with audio and visual tasks through a unified diffusion model approach.

**Abstract:** We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Sparse Autoencoders, feature absorption, large language models, interpretability, empirical validation

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper analyzes the robustness of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in feature decomposition of large language models, introducing the concepts of feature splitting and feature absorption, and providing empirical validation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) decompose activation spaces of large language models (LLMs) into interpretable features and investigate the resulting phenomena of feature splitting and absorption.

**Method:** The authors introduce a metric for detecting feature absorption in SAEs and empirically validate their findings across hundreds of LLM SAEs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the concept of feature absorption in SAEs
	2. Development of a metric to detect feature absorption
	3. Empirical validation of findings on hundreds of LLM SAEs.

**Result:** The study reveals that hierarchical features in SAEs do not robustly split as expected, leading to a phenomenon where features are absorbed into child features, undermining the interpretability of LLMs.

**Limitations:** Limited to the exploration of feature absorption within the context of Sparse Autoencoders; further research needed to find solutions to the identified issues.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight significant theoretical challenges that must be addressed to improve the robustness of SAEs for interpreting LLMs at scale, suggesting that simply adjusting SAE sizes or sparsity does not resolve the issue.

**Abstract:** Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) aim to decompose the activation space of large language models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latent directions or features. As we increase the number of features in the SAE, hierarchical features tend to split into finer features ("math" may split into "algebra", "geometry", etc.), a phenomenon referred to as feature splitting. However, we show that sparse decomposition and splitting of hierarchical features is not robust. Specifically, we show that seemingly monosemantic features fail to fire where they should, and instead get "absorbed" into their children features. We coin this phenomenon feature absorption, and show that it is caused by optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy. We introduce a metric to detect absorption in SAEs, and validate our findings empirically on hundreds of LLM SAEs. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE sizes or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue. We discuss the implications of feature absorption in SAEs and some potential approaches to solve the fundamental theoretical issues before SAEs can be used for interpreting LLMs robustly and at scale.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** language models, fine-tuning, task selection, gradient approximation, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel algorithm for fine-tuning language models efficiently by selecting optimal auxiliary tasks, achieving significant speedups and improved performance in downstream NLP tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of selecting the right subset of auxiliary tasks for fine-tuning language models, which is crucial for enhancing performance on target tasks without excessive computational cost.

**Method:** The proposed algorithm performs multitask training to obtain a meta initialization, then estimates the model fine-tuning loss using functional values and gradients from this initialization, avoiding repeated training on task subsets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a gradient-based loss approximation for task selection
	2. Substantial speedup in fine-tuning performance estimation
	3. Improved accuracy in downstream NLP tasks through optimized task selection

**Result:** The approach yields a speedup of 30x over traditional subset selection methods and maintains only 1% error margin in performance estimation, significantly benefiting task performance in downstream evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By optimizing task selection through a gradient-based approximation, the method improves fine-tuning efficacy, enhancing performance by up to 3.8% compared to existing methods.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of fine-tuning a language model (LM) for a target task by optimally using the information from $n$ auxiliary tasks. This problem has broad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data selection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is that not all auxiliary tasks are beneficial in improving the performance of the target task. Thus, selecting the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial. Conventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise selection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated training on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating model fine-tuning performance without requiring repeated training. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using data from all tasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model fine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the meta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based approximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs. Thus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few seconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model once on the selected subset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach, delivering a speedup of $30\times$ over conventional subset selection while incurring only $1\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances. In downstream evaluations involving both instruction tuning and chain-of-thought fine-tuning, this loss-based selection approach improves over prior gradient or representation similarity-based methods for subset selection by up to $3.8\%$.

**Motivation:** To clarify what constitutes NLP research by providing a quantitative examination of NLP research papers and understanding their contributions over time.

**Method:** The authors created NLPContributions, a dataset of annotated abstracts, and introduced a task for automatically identifying and classifying contribution statements in NLP research papers. They presented experimental results on this task and applied their model to analyze contributions across approximately 29,000 NLP papers.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** The analysis reveals historical trends in NLP research, highlighting a resurgence of interest in language and human-centric studies since the late 2010s, alongside a steady increase in methodological and dataset contributions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dataset and the trends analyzed offer insights into the evolving nature of NLP research and can facilitate data-driven literature surveys.

**Abstract:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an established and dynamic field. Despite this, what constitutes NLP research remains debated. In this work, we address the question by quantitatively examining NLP research papers. We propose a taxonomy of research contributions and introduce NLPContributions, a dataset of nearly $2k$ NLP research paper abstracts, carefully annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contribution statements and classifying their types from research papers. We present experimental results for this task and apply our model to $\sim$$29k$ NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. We show that NLP research has taken a winding path -- with the focus on language and human-centric studies being prominent in the 1970s and 80s, tapering off in the 1990s and 2000s, and starting to rise again since the late 2010s. Alongside this revival, we observe a steady rise in dataset and methodological contributions since the 1990s, such that today, on average, individual NLP papers contribute in more ways than ever before. Our dataset and analyses offer a powerful lens for tracing research trends and offer potential for generating informed, data-driven literature surveys.

**Conclusion:** AfriHuBERT demonstrates competitiveness with larger self-supervised models and exhibits improved performance in low-resource ASR scenarios.

**Abstract:** In this work, we present AfriHuBERT, an extension of mHuBERT-147, a compact self-supervised learning (SSL) model pretrained on 147 languages. While mHuBERT-147 covered 16 African languages, we expand this to 1,226 through continued pretraining on 10K+ hours of speech data from diverse sources, benefiting an African population of over 600M. We evaluate AfriHuBERT on two key speech tasks, Spoken Language Identification (SLID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), using the FLEURS benchmark. Our results show a +3.6% F1 score improvement for SLID and a -2.1% average Word Error Rate (WER) reduction for ASR over mHuBERT-147, and demonstrates competitiveness with larger SSL models such as MMS and XEUS. Further analysis shows that ASR models trained on AfriHuBERT exhibit improved cross-corpus generalization and are competitive in extremely low-resource ASR scenarios.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** privacy leakage, contextual knowledge, language models, differential privacy, context influence

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a metric called 'context influence' to estimate privacy leakage from contextual knowledge used by language models, emphasizing its importance in tasks like question answering.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding privacy leakage in language models when using contextual knowledge is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and improving trust in AI applications.

**Method:** The paper proposes the 'context influence' metric, which draws from differential privacy to estimate how subsets of context affect a language model's responses, distinguishing it from the model's inherent parametric knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the 'context influence' metric for privacy leakage assessment.
	2. Empirical analysis of factors affecting context privacy leakage in language models.
	3. Clarification of the relationship between parametric and contextual knowledge in language models.

**Result:** The experimental findings reveal that privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution compared to the model's parametric knowledge, and that various factors can influence this leakage.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the estimation of privacy leakage without providing a comprehensive framework for mitigating these risks in practical applications.

**Conclusion:** The study provides insights into the privacy risks linked to augmented contextual knowledge, informing practitioners about the importance of evaluating context privacy in language model applications.

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) rely on their parametric knowledge augmented with relevant contextual knowledge for certain tasks, such as question answering. However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM's output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM's parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce $\emph{context influence}$, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM's response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution with respect to parametric knowledge. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate how context influence properly attributes the privacy leakage to augmented contexts, and we evaluate how factors-- such as model size, context size, generation position, etc.-- affect context privacy leakage. The practical implications of our results will inform practitioners of the privacy risk associated with augmented contextual knowledge.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces individualistic alignment in AI, proposing the IndieValueCatalog dataset to assess language models' ability to understand individualistic value reasoning rather than relying solely on demographics.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the shortcomings of current methods in AI that categorize individuals into fixed diversity buckets, potentially leading to stereotyping.

**Method:** The authors present the IndieValueCatalog, derived from the World Values Survey, to evaluate language models in predicting individualistic values based on personalized value-expressing statements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of individualistic alignment as a concept for AI systems
	2. Development of the IndieValueCatalog dataset for studying individualistic value reasoning
	3. Identification of the limitations and partiality in language models regarding individualistic values.

**Result:** Frontier language models demonstrate only 55% to 65% accuracy in predicting individualistic values, indicating significant room for improvement.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the accuracy of language models and may not address other dimensions of alignment issues or broader ethical concerns.

**Conclusion:** The reliance on demographic information to approximate individualistic values is inadequate; a deeper understanding of individual variation is required in AI systems.

**Abstract:** Recent calls for pluralistic alignment emphasize that AI systems should address the diverse needs of all people. Yet, efforts in this space often require sorting people into fixed buckets of pre-specified diversity-defining dimensions (e.g., demographics), risking smoothing out individualistic variations or even stereotyping. To achieve an authentic representation of diversity that respects individuality, we propose individualistic alignment. While individualistic alignment can take various forms, we introduce IndieValueCatalog, a dataset transformed from the influential World Values Survey (WVS), to study language models (LMs) on the specific challenge of individualistic value reasoning. Given a sample of an individual's value-expressing statements, models are tasked with predicting this person's value judgments in novel cases. With IndieValueCatalog, we reveal critical limitations in frontier LMs, which achieve only 55 % to 65% accuracy in predicting individualistic values. Moreover, our results highlight that a precise description of individualistic values cannot be approximated only with demographic information. We also identify a partiality of LMs in reasoning about global individualistic values, as measured by our proposed Value Inequity Index ({\sigma}Inequity). Finally, we train a series of IndieValueReasoners to reveal new patterns and dynamics into global human values.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) produce biased recommendations based on user identity, emphasizing the need for transparency in such systems.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to address the challenge of distinguishing between bias and useful personalization in LLM-generated recommendations, particularly in the context of racial stereotypes.

**Method:** By conducting experiments with multiple popular consumer LLMs, the authors analyze how user-revealed identity characteristics affect the recommendations produced by the models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of racial stereotyping in LLM recommendations
	2. Development of a framework for identifying bias vs. personalization
	3. Call for increased transparency in chatbot recommendations

**Result:** The findings indicate that user identity significantly influences the model's recommendations, yet the models fail to transparently disclose this bias in their responses.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on four American racial groups and may not cover other demographics or cultures.

**Conclusion:** The authors conclude that chatbots should indicate when recommendations are influenced by user identity characteristics to promote transparency and mitigate bias.

**Abstract:** While personalized recommendations are often desired by users, it can be difficult in practice to distinguish cases of bias from cases of personalization: we find that models generate racially stereotypical recommendations regardless of whether the user revealed their identity intentionally through explicit indications or unintentionally through implicit cues. We demonstrate that when people use large language models (LLMs) to generate recommendations, the LLMs produce responses that reflect both what the user wants and who the user is. We argue that chatbots ought to transparently indicate when recommendations are influenced by a user's revealed identity characteristics, but observe that they currently fail to do so. Our experiments show that even though a user's revealed identity significantly influences model recommendations (p < 0.001), model responses obfuscate this fact in response to user queries. This bias and lack of transparency occurs consistently across multiple popular consumer LLMs and for four American racial groups.

**Motivation:** To address the unclear multilingual performance of English-centric LLMs and evaluate their capabilities across more languages beyond classic NLP tasks.

**Method:** MEXA computes the alignment between English and other languages using parallel sentences, allowing for the estimation of model performance in different languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces MEXA for multilingual evaluation of LLMs
	2. Uses parallel sentences for assessment across multiple languages
	3. Achieves high correlation in performance prediction

**Result:** MEXA achieves an average Pearson correlation of 0.90 between predicted scores and actual task performance across languages in controlled experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MEXA demonstrates reliability in estimating the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs and enhances understanding of their multilingual potential.

**Abstract:** English-centric large language models (LLMs) often show strong multilingual capabilities. However, their multilingual performance remains unclear and is under-evaluated for many other languages. Most benchmarks for multilinguality focus on classic NLP tasks or cover a minimal number of languages. We introduce MEXA, a method for assessing the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained English-centric LLMs using parallel sentences, which are available for more languages than existing downstream tasks. MEXA leverages that English-centric LLMs use English as a pivot language in their intermediate layers. MEXA computes the alignment between English and non-English languages using parallel sentences to evaluate the transfer of language understanding from English to other languages. This alignment can be used to estimate model performance in different languages. We conduct controlled experiments using various parallel datasets (FLORES-200 and Bible), models (Llama family, Gemma family, Mistral, and OLMo), and established downstream tasks (Belebele, m-MMLU, and m-ARC). We explore different methods to compute embeddings in decoder-only models. Our results show that MEXA, in its default settings, achieves an average Pearson correlation of 0.90 between its predicted scores and actual task performance across languages. This suggests that MEXA is a reliable method for estimating the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs, providing a clearer understanding of their multilingual potential and the inner workings of LLMs. Leaderboard: https://cis-lmu-mexa.hf.space, Code: https://github.com/cisnlp/MEXA.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The goal is to improve translation quality of low-resource languages by optimizing the training schedule in multilingual NMT using data from high-resource languages.

**Method:** The authors propose two reinforcement learning-based algorithms: Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning and Deep Q Network, both aimed at improving the training schedule.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a reinforcement learning approach to optimize training schedules in NMT.
	2. Implementation of Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning and Deep Q Network for training schedule adjustment.
	3. Empirical evidence showing improved translation scores for low-resource languages using these methods.

**Result:** The Deep Q Network method shows significant improvements in BLEU and COMET scores on an 8-to-1 translation dataset, outperforming both random and shuffled batch selections.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Optimizing the training schedule using reinforcement learning leads to better performance in multilingual NMT for low-resource language translation.

**Abstract:** Multilingual NMT is a viable solution for translating low-resource languages (LRLs) when data from high-resource languages (HRLs) from the same language family is available. However, the training schedule, i.e. the order of presentation of languages, has an impact on the quality of such systems. Here, in a many-to-one translation setting, we propose to apply two algorithms that use reinforcement learning to optimize the training schedule of NMT: (1) Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning and (2) Deep Q Network. The former uses an exponentially smoothed estimate of the returns of each action based on the loss on monolingual or multilingual development subsets, while the latter estimates rewards using an additional neural network trained from the history of actions selected in different states of the system, together with the rewards received. On a 8-to-1 translation dataset with LRLs and HRLs, our second method improves BLEU and COMET scores with respect to both random selection of monolingual batches and shuffled multilingual batches, by adjusting the number of presentations of LRL vs. HRL batches.

**Motivation:** The study explores the limitations of current retrieval augmented generation methods due to imperfect retrieval, which can include irrelevant or misleading information.

**Method:** Astute RAG was developed to improve the integration of internal and external knowledge, using an approach that adapts and iterates over the retrieved information while considering source reliability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Astute RAG to improve resilience against imperfect retrieval
	2. Demonstration of superior performance compared to previous RAG methods
	3. Focus on resolving knowledge conflicts between internal and external sources.

**Result:** Experiments show that Astute RAG outperforms existing robustness-enhanced RAG methods, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding traditional LLM use in worse-case scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Astute RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts and enhances the trustworthiness of RAG systems, highlighting the importance of accurate integration of internal and external data.

**Abstract:** Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.

**Motivation:** To address the issue of commonsense level vision-knowledge conflict in MLLMs, where visual information contradicts the model's internal knowledge.

**Method:** An automated framework with human-in-the-loop quality control to generate inputs simulating vision-knowledge conflicts, resulting in a benchmark with images and QA pairs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a framework for simulating vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs
	2. Developed a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark for evaluating MLLM performance
	3. Proposed the 'Focus-on-Vision' prompting strategy for conflict resolution

**Result:** Assessment of nine representative MLLMs reveals a 20% over-reliance on parametric knowledge for queries, particularly in Yes-No and action-related problems.

**Limitations:** Existing approaches only partially mitigate the conflicts, indicating a need for further investigation and scaling of the framework.

**Conclusion:** While some strategies mitigate the conflict, the issue persists and can be better addressed with the proposed framework and benchmark.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the problem of commonsense level vision-knowledge conflict in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where visual information contradicts model's internal commonsense knowledge. To study this issue, we introduce an automated framework, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to generate inputs designed to simulate and evaluate these conflicts in MLLMs. Using this framework, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark consisting of 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. The benchmark covers two aspects of conflict and three question types, providing a thorough assessment tool. We apply this benchmark to assess the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs from various model families. Our results indicate an evident over-reliance on parametric knowledge for approximately 20% of all queries, especially among Yes-No and action-related problems. Based on these findings, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing approaches to mitigating the conflicts and compare them to our "Focus-on-Vision" prompting strategy. Despite some improvement, the vision-knowledge conflict remains unresolved and can be further scaled through our data construction framework. Our proposed framework, benchmark, and analysis contribute to the understanding and mitigation of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs.

Through extensive experiments with medium-size LMs like BERT and RoBERTa, and larger LMs like Bloom-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B, we show that our method gives comparable or better accuracies than state-of-art PEFT methods while also being more memory and computation-efficient. We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.

**TL;DR:** Model Swarms is a collaborative algorithm for adapting large language models (LLMs) using swarm intelligence for improved performance in various tasks with minimal data requirements.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the adaptability of LLMs without needing extensive tuning or large amounts of data, addressing the limitations in current model composition methods.

**Method:** The approach involves using a pool of LLM experts guided by their best checkpoints to collaboratively optimize a utility function representing model adaptation objectives through movement in weight space.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Model Swarms as a tuning-free adaptation method for LLMs.
	2. Demonstrates effectiveness in low-data regimes with as few as 200 examples.
	3. Shows significant performance improvements over existing model composition techniques.

**Result:** Model Swarms significantly outperforms 12 model composition baselines, achieving up to a 21.0% improvement in various tasks and contexts, and reveals new capabilities in the LLMs.

**Limitations:** While the method proves effective, its reliance on initial expert checkpoints could impact adaptability if these checkpoints are not optimally selected.

**Conclusion:** The collaborative search process of Model Swarms facilitates the discovery of new model capabilities and effectively transitions experts from weak to strong performance.

**Abstract:** We propose Model Swarms, a collaborative search algorithm to adapt LLMs via swarm intelligence, the collective behavior guiding individual systems. Specifically, Model Swarms starts with a pool of LLM experts and a utility function. Guided by the best-found checkpoints across models, diverse LLM experts collaboratively move in the weight space and optimize a utility function representing model adaptation objectives. Compared to existing model composition approaches, Model Swarms offers tuning-free model adaptation, works in low-data regimes with as few as 200 examples, and does not require assumptions about specific experts in the swarm or how they should be composed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Model Swarms could flexibly adapt LLM experts to a single task, multi-task domains, reward models, as well as diverse human interests, improving over 12 model composition baselines by up to 21.0% across tasks and contexts. Further analysis reveals that LLM experts discover previously unseen capabilities in initial checkpoints and that Model Swarms enable the weak-to-strong transition of experts through the collaborative search process.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** BridG MT enhances LLM translation, especially in low-resource scenarios, using Sentence Bridging and Gradual MT.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of LLMs in translating low-resource languages without relying heavily on external knowledge.

**Method:** BridG MT employs Sentence Bridging to create a sequence of transition sentences and Gradual MT to translate them sequentially, leveraging earlier translations as few-shot examples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BridG MT combining Sentence Bridging and Gradual MT.
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness on various LLMs and multiple languages.
	3. Outperformance of traditional few-shot translation methods.

**Result:** Experiments on four LLMs and seven languages show that BridG MT improves translation performance, surpassing methods that require many few-shot examples.

**Limitations:** The method's performance may vary with different languages and contexts that may not be covered in the study.

**Conclusion:** BridG MT offers a robust alternative for enhancing translation in low-resource language scenarios without depending on external sources.

**Abstract:** Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation performance without requiring fine-tuning on additional parallel corpora. However, they still face significant challenges in certain scenarios, particularly when translating low-resource languages. A common approach to address this issue is to provide external knowledge, such as few-shot examples, to assist LLMs in translating specific source sentences. However, this method is fundamentally limited by the quality or quantity of relevant sources, which cannot always be guaranteed. To reduce LLMs' reliance on external sources, we propose BridG MT, a method that combines Sentence Bridging, which generates a sequence of sentences as a bridge that gradually transition from easy-to-translate to more difficult, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates these sentences using earlier translations as few-shot examples for subsequent ones. Experiments conducted on four LLMs across seven languages demonstrate that our method effectively enhances translation performance, even outperforming translation methods that rely on a large number of few-shot examples.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores model merging strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing the concept of model kinship, which relates to performance improvements during merging.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve the merging processes of LLMs by understanding the performance gains through the similarity between models, termed model kinship.

**Method:** The authors conduct extensive empirical analysis to investigate the relationship between model kinship and performance gains in model merging. They propose a merging strategy called Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the concept of model kinship in LLM merging.
	2. Development of the Top-k Greedy Merging strategy based on model kinship.
	3. Empirical evidence supporting the link between model kinship and performance improvements.

**Result:** The proposed strategy shows improved performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating that model kinship can guide the selection of models for merging to achieve optimal performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Using model kinship as a criterion aids in ongoing model merging, helping to avoid issues like degradation and local optima.

**Abstract:** Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** synthetic data, human annotation, Fact Verification, Question Answering, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the impact of synthetic data on NLP tasks, particularly Fact Verification and Question Answering, revealing that a small amount of human data significantly enhances model performance despite using mostly synthetic data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how synthetic data can replace human annotation in NLP tasks due to the high cost of human annotation.

**Method:** The authors studied the effects of incrementally replacing human-generated data with synthetic data across eight diverse datasets in the domains of Fact Verification and Question Answering.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the marginal decrease in performance with high percentages of synthetic data.
	2. Identified the critical importance of the last human data points for model efficacy.
	3. Provided insights on the cost-effectiveness of mixed data sourcing for NLP tasks.

**Result:** Replacing up to 90% of human-generated data only slightly affects performance, but the last 10% is critical, with models benefiting significantly from just 125 human-generated data points.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A small fraction of human-generated data is valuable, as it can improve models trained predominantly on synthetic data; hence, investigating cost-effective ratios between human and synthetic data is crucial.

**Abstract:** Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Router-Tuning and MindSkip to enhance the efficiency of transformer models by dynamically adjusting computational depth and reducing training costs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Traditional transformer models waste computation on every token. The Mixture of Depths (MoD) aims to optimize this but faces challenges such as high training costs and potential performance loss when important layers are skipped.

**Method:** Router-Tuning fine-tunes only the router using a small dataset, reducing overhead, while MindSkip implements Attention with Dynamic Depths to maintain performance and improve efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced Router-Tuning to reduce training costs associated with MoD methods.
	2. Developed MindSkip to achieve dynamic depth adjustment while maintaining performance.
	3. Demonstrated significant computational speedup with minimal performance loss through experiments.

**Result:** The approach achieves competitive results with a 21% speedup and only a 0.2% drop in performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods improve computational efficiency in transformer models, making them more resource-effective without sacrificing performance.

**Abstract:** Traditional transformer models often allocate a fixed amount of computational resources to every input token, leading to inefficient and unnecessary computation. To address this, the Mixture of Depths (MoD) was introduced to dynamically adjust the computational depth by skipping less important layers. Despite its promise, current MoD approaches remain under-explored and face two main challenges: (1) high training costs due to the need to train the entire model along with the routers that determine which layers to skip, and (2) the risk of performance degradation when important layers are bypassed. In response to the first issue, we propose Router-Tuning, a method that fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset, drastically reducing the computational overhead associated with full model training. For the second challenge, we propose MindSkip, which deploys Attention with Dynamic Depths. This method preserves the model's performance while significantly enhancing computational and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers competitive results while dramatically improving the computation efficiency, e.g., 21\% speedup and only a 0.2\% performance drop.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces BanTH, the first multi-label hate speech dataset for transliterated Bangla, and establishes novel methods for classification.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To detect and classify hate speech in low-resource languages, specifically in transliterated Bangla, addressing a critical gap in the research.

**Method:** Developed a multi-label transliterated Bangla hate speech dataset (BanTH) with 37.3k samples from YouTube comments and established transformer encoder-based baselines while employing a novel translation-based LLM prompting strategy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the BanTH dataset for transliterated Bangla
	2. State-of-the-art transformer encoders for hate speech classification
	3. A novel LLM prompting strategy for transliterated text

**Result:** The further pre-trained transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BanTH dataset, and the proposed LLM prompting strategy outperforms others in zero-shot settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The BanTH dataset not only addresses the lack of resources in hate speech research for Bangla but also paves the way for future work on more complex language challenges.

**Abstract:** The proliferation of transliterated texts in digital spaces has emphasized the need for detecting and classifying hate speech in languages beyond English, particularly in low-resource languages. As online discourse can perpetuate discrimination based on target groups, e.g. gender, religion, and origin, multi-label classification of hateful content can help in comprehending hate motivation and enhance content moderation. While previous efforts have focused on monolingual or binary hate classification tasks, no work has yet addressed the challenge of multi-label hate speech classification in transliterated Bangla. We introduce BanTH, the first multi-label transliterated Bangla hate speech dataset comprising 37.3k samples. The samples are sourced from YouTube comments, where each instance is labeled with one or more target groups, reflecting the regional demographic. We establish novel transformer encoder-based baselines by further pre-training on transliterated Bangla corpus. We also propose a novel translation-based LLM prompting strategy for transliterated text. Experiments reveal that our further pre-trained encoders are achieving state-of-the-art performance on the BanTH dataset, while our translation-based prompting outperforms other strategies in the zero-shot setting. The introduction of BanTH not only fills a critical gap in hate speech research for Bangla but also sets the stage for future exploration into code-mixed and multi-label classification challenges in underrepresented languages.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance the factual accuracy of outputs from Large Language Models by enabling them to express uncertainty, particularly in long-form generative tasks.

**Method:** A refinement-based data collection framework is introduced along with a two-stage training pipeline that employs supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to improve uncertainty expression in long-form responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Long-form Generation with Uncertainty (LoGU) task
	2. Development of a refinement-based data collection framework
	3. Implementation of a two-stage training pipeline for enhancing uncertainty expression

**Result:** The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of generated content, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses across three long-form instruction following datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that enhancing uncertainty modeling in LLMs can lead to more reliable and accurate long-form text generation.

**Abstract:** While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.

**TL;DR:** MathNeuro is a method to isolate math reasoning parameters in LLMs without affecting general language ability, showing improved math performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how math reasoning is encoded in LLMs can lead to targeted interventions for improving math performance in AI models.

**Method:** MathNeuro uses a computationally efficient approach that filters out parameters important for general language tasks to isolate math-specific parameters.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MathNeuro for isolating math-specific parameters in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of performance improvement in math tasks with minimal impact on language tasks
	3. Data efficiency of identifying math parameters with a single sample

**Result:** By pruning identified parameters, MathNeuro can remove a LLM's math reasoning ability while maintaining its general language proficiency; scaling these parameters improves performance on math benchmarks significantly.

**Limitations:** The long-term effects of parameter pruning on model performance and generalizability remain to be explored.

**Conclusion:** MathNeuro demonstrates a promising direction for future research on isolating and improving math reasoning in language models without compromising their overall capabilities.

**Abstract:** Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed model-agnostic framework offers a novel approach to modulate LLM semantics while maintaining their performance, addressing the challenges of interpretability and safety in deployment.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through pretraining on extensive data. This enables efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. However, the lack of interpretability in their underlying mechanisms limits the ability to effectively steer LLMs for specific applications. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs from a cognitive perspective using eye movement measures. Specifically, we analyze the layer-wise correlation between human cognitive indicators and LLM representations. Building on these insights, we propose a heuristic approach for selecting the optimal steering layer to modulate LLM semantics. To this end, we introduce an efficient selective layer intervention based on prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, which conventionally adjust either all layers or only the final layer. Additionally, we present an implicit layer contrastive intervention during inference to steer LLMs away from toxic outputs. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation tasks, conducted on GPT-2, Llama2-7B, and Mistral-7B, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. As a model-agnostic framework, it enhances the interpretability of LLMs while improving efficiency for safe deployment.

**Result:** The adapted diffusion models, DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with AR counterparts across various language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks.

**Limitations:** Challenges in scaling training of diffusion models and dependency on the established AR models for adaptation.

**Conclusion:** The study successfully shows that adapting AR models into DLMs enhances text generation capabilities, paving the way for further exploration in diffusion modeling for language tasks.

**Abstract:** Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. We release a suite of DLMs (127M-355M-7B) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructions https://github.com/HKUNLP/DiffuLLaMA.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The implementation of FenCE shows significant advancements in the factual correction of language models, thus contributing to more reliable AI-generated content.

**Abstract:** Factuality evaluation aims to detect factual errors produced by language models (LMs) and hence guide the development of more factual models. Towards this goal, we train a factuality evaluator, FenCE, that provides LM generators with claim-level factuality feedback. We conduct data augmentation on a combination of public judgment datasets to train FenCE to (1) generate textual critiques along with scores and (2) make claim-level judgment based on diverse source documents obtained by various tools. We then present a framework that leverages FenCE to improve the factuality of LM generators by constructing training data. Specifically, we generate a set of candidate responses, leverage FenCE to revise and score each response without introducing lesser-known facts, and train the generator by preferring highly scored revised responses. Experiments show that our data augmentation methods improve the evaluator's accuracy by 2.9% on LLM-AggreFact. With FenCE, we improve Llama2-7B-chat and Llama3-8B-chat's factuality rate by 16.86% and 14.45% on FActScore, outperforming state-of-the-art factuality finetuning methods by 8.83% and 6.96%.

**Motivation:** To enhance machine translation performance for various languages using grammatically-informed prompting strategies, particularly in low-resource contexts.

**Method:** GrammaMT introduces three training-free prompting strategies—gloss-shot, chain-gloss, and model-gloss—requiring only a few examples for setup.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of three novel prompting strategies for machine translation
	2. Use of Interlinear Glossed Text to inform translation tasks
	3. Demonstrated significant BLEU score improvements across various language benchmarks

**Result:** The proposed methods improved translation performance significantly on instruction-tuned LLMs across three benchmarks, showcasing enhancements of over 17 BLEU points with proper gloss access.

**Limitations:** The performance enhancement is contingent on accurate generation or access to gloss resources, which may not always be achievable.

**Conclusion:** GrammaMT successfully demonstrates the potential to enhance machine translation through strategic use of gloss resources, particularly beneficial for low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** We introduce GrammaMT, a grammatically-aware prompting approach for machine translation that uses Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a common form of linguistic description providing morphological and lexical annotations for source sentences. GrammaMT proposes three prompting strategies: gloss-shot, chain-gloss and model-gloss. All are training-free, requiring only a few examples that involve minimal effort to collect, and making them well-suited for low-resource setups. Experiments show that GrammaMT enhances translation performance on open-source instruction-tuned LLMs for various low- to high-resource languages across three benchmarks: (1) the largest IGT corpus, (2) the challenging 2023 SIGMORPHON Shared Task data over endangered languages, and (3) even in an out-of-domain setting with FLORES. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that leveraging gloss resources could substantially boost MT performance (by over 17 BLEU points) if LLMs accurately generate or access input sentence glosses.

**Conclusion:** TrajAgent effectively enhances automated trajectory modeling, highlighting the potential of LLMs in addressing complex trajectory data challenges.

**Abstract:** Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.

**TL;DR:** Proposes a new method called Translation by Anticipating Future (TAF) to enhance simultaneous machine translation using LLMs.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the quality of simultaneous machine translation by mimicking human interpreters who forecast future words.

**Method:** Utilizes a large language model to predict upcoming source words while translating simultaneously, striking a balance between translation quality and latency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the TAF method for simultaneous machine translation.
	2. Improved translation quality via future word anticipation using LLMs.
	3. Demonstrated better performance compared to multiple SMT baselines.

**Result:** TAF outperforms existing SMT methods by achieving a better translation quality-latency trade-off, with improvements of up to 5 BLEU points.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The TAF method significantly enhances the simultaneous machine translation process by incorporating future word predictions without incurring high latency.

**Abstract:** Simultaneous machine translation (SMT) takes streaming input utterances and incrementally produces target text. Existing SMT methods mainly use the partial utterance that has already arrived at the input and the generated hypothesis. Motivated by human interpreters' technique to forecast future words before hearing them, we propose $\textbf{T}$ranslation by $\textbf{A}$nticipating $\textbf{F}$uture (TAF), a method to improve translation quality while retraining low latency. Its core idea is to use a large language model (LLM) to predict future source words and opportunistically translate without introducing too much risk. We evaluate our TAF and multiple baselines of SMT on four language directions. Experiments show that TAF achieves the best translation quality-latency trade-off and outperforms the baselines by up to 5 BLEU points at the same latency (three words).

**Conclusion:** The release of BhasaAnuvaad and IndicSeamless sets a new standard for speech translation in Indian languages, promoting open-source accessibility.

**Abstract:** Speech translation for Indian languages remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available datasets that capture the linguistic diversity and domain coverage essential for real-world applications. Existing datasets cover a fraction of Indian languages and lack the breadth needed to train robust models that generalize beyond curated benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce BhasaAnuvaad, the largest speech translation dataset for Indian languages, spanning over 44 thousand hours of audio and 17 million aligned text segments across 14 Indian languages and English. Our dataset is built through a threefold methodology: (a) aggregating high-quality existing sources, (b) large-scale web crawling to ensure linguistic and domain diversity, and (c) creating synthetic data to model real-world speech disfluencies. Leveraging BhasaAnuvaad, we train IndicSeamless, a state-of-the-art speech translation model for Indian languages that performs better than existing models. Our experiments demonstrate improvements in the translation quality, setting a new standard for Indian language speech translation. We will release all the code, data and model weights in the open-source, with permissive licenses to promote accessibility and collaboration.

**Motivation:** To address the imbalances in cross-lingual alignment for information extraction in LLMs, providing a robust solution for multilingual capabilities.

**Method:** KnowCoder-X standardizes multilingual schema representation using Python classes and formulates IE as a unified code generation task, followed by instruction tuning on translated instance prediction and creating a large bilingual dataset, ParallelNER.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a novel LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal information extraction.
	2. Developed a high-quality bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples for training.
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements over existing models in cross-lingual tasks.

**Result:** KnowCoder-X surpasses existing models like ChatGPT and SoTA by significant margins in cross-lingual information extraction tasks, demonstrating advanced capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual information extraction and provides a strong foundation for future multilingual applications.

**Abstract:** Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the translated instance prediction task to enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by 30.17\% and SoTA by 20.03\%, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

**Motivation:** To address the hallucination and factual inaccuracies prevalent in LLM-generated content by proposing a more nuanced verification approach.

**Method:** The paper proposes breaking down complex claims into smaller sub-claims for individual verification and introduces FactLens, a benchmark with metrics for evaluating sub-claim quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FactLens benchmark for evaluating fine-grained fact verification
	2. Demonstration of improved accuracy in verification through sub-claims
	3. Development of metrics for assessing sub-claim quality

**Result:** The study finds that the sub-claim approach allows for more precise identification of inaccuracies and shows alignment between automated evaluations and human judgments in validation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Fine-grained verification improves the transparency and reliability of LLM-generated information by addressing nuanced errors that traditional methods may overlook.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability in language generation and understanding, but their tendency to hallucinate and produce factually incorrect information remains a key limitation. To verify LLM-generated contents and claims from other sources, traditional verification approaches often rely on holistic models that assign a single factuality label to complex claims, potentially obscuring nuanced errors. In this paper, we advocate for a shift towards fine-grained verification, where complex claims are broken down into smaller sub-claims for individual verification, allowing for more precise identification of inaccuracies, improved transparency, and reduced ambiguity in evidence retrieval. However, generating sub-claims poses challenges, such as maintaining context and ensuring semantic equivalence with respect to the original claim. We introduce FactLens, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained fact verification, with metrics and automated evaluators of sub-claim quality. The benchmark data is manually curated to ensure high-quality ground truth. Our results show alignment between automated FactLens evaluators and human judgments, and we discuss the impact of sub-claim characteristics on the overall verification performance.

**Motivation:** To improve topic modeling in NLP by addressing limitations of LLMs in topic discovery such as incomplete coverage and misalignment.

**Method:** Integration of LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs) using an Optimal Transport-based alignment objective for topic refinement.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LLM-ITL framework
	2. Improved interpretability of topics
	3. Dynamic adjustment of topic refinement based on LLM confidence

**Result:** LLM-ITL significantly enhances topic interpretability and maintains high quality in document representations, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework represents a flexible and effective enhancement for existing NTMs in topic modeling.

**Abstract:** Topic modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing, allowing the discovery of latent thematic structures in text corpora. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM. Meanwhile, an LLM refines these topics using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective, where the refinement is dynamically adjusted based on the LLM's confidence in suggesting topical words for each set of input words. With the flexibility of being integrated into many existing NTMs, the proposed approach enhances the interpretability of topics while preserving the efficiency of NTMs in learning topics and document representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-ITL helps NTMs significantly improve their topic interpretability while maintaining the quality of document representation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the ineffectiveness of existing hate speech detection models caused by systematic biases in evaluation datasets across geographies.

**Method:** Construction of HateDay, a global hate speech dataset from a random sample of tweets in eight languages and four English-speaking countries, followed by analysis of detection performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset
	2. Identification of performance gaps in existing hate speech detection models across different languages
	3. Emphasis on the need for evaluations on real-world reflective data for hate speech detection systems

**Result:** Significant variation in hate speech prevalence across languages and regions, with real-world model performance being very low, especially for non-European languages.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on hate speech from a social media perspective and may not generalize to other contexts.

**Conclusion:** Existing models are poorly suited for automatic hate speech moderation and require substantial human oversight to achieve effective moderation rates.

**Abstract:** To address the global challenge of online hate speech, prior research has developed detection models to flag such content on social media. However, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of these models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and composition of hate speech across languages and regions. We show that evaluations on academic datasets greatly overestimate real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages. Our analysis identifies key drivers of this gap, including models' difficulty to distinguish hate from offensive speech and a mismatch between the target groups emphasized in academic datasets and those most frequently targeted in real-world settings. We argue that poor model performance makes public models ill-suited for automatic hate speech moderation and find that high moderation rates are only achievable with substantial human oversight. Our results underscore the need to evaluate detection systems on data that reflects the complexity and diversity of real-world social media.

**TL;DR:** Evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop queries without exploiting shortcuts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess LLMs' latent reasoning abilities in multi-hop queries while preventing shortcuts.

**Method:** The dataset SOCRATES is constructed by excluding queries with co-appearing entities in training, focusing on selective relations and systematic removal of guessable answers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SOCRATES dataset to evaluate LLMs without shortcuts
	2. Demonstration of latent multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs
	3. Analysis of factors affecting latent composability in queries.

**Result:** LLMs show promising latent multi-hop reasoning for certain queries, achieving 80% composability for countries, but only 5% for years.

**Limitations:** Limited to specific query types where latent reasoning is more prominent.

**Conclusion:** Latent reasoning abilities emerge during pretraining, with a noted gap between latent and explicit reasoning.

**Abstract:** We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challenge in such evaluation is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encountering the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity "United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities might have co-appeared during training. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.

**Motivation:** Traditional in-context learning methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to their dependence on the quality of examples and lack of explicit reasoning guidance.

**Method:** HiAR-ICL defines five atomic reasoning actions and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to create high-level reasoning patterns, which are dynamically selected during inference based on problem attributes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces HiAR-ICL for abstract reasoning in ICL
	2. Employs Monte Carlo Tree Search for reasoning pattern construction
	3. Achieves superior accuracy over existing models on reasoning tasks

**Result:** HiAR-ICL achieves 80.6% accuracy on MATH and 62.5% on AMC using only 200 prior samples with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, outperforming GPT-4o.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The HiAR-ICL approach improves model performance on reasoning tasks and is adaptable with existing post-training techniques, offering a robust framework for complex reasoning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform downstream tasks through advanced prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, traditional ICL paradigms encounter significant limitations in complex reasoning tasks, stemming primarily from their dependence on example quality and absence of explicit reasoning guidance. To address these challenges, we introduce HiAR-ICL, a **Hi**gh-level **A**utomated **R**easoning paradigm in **ICL** that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract reasoning patterns, thereby extending the conventional concept of "context" in ICL. Our approach begins by defining five atomic reasoning actions, upon which we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to systematically construct high-level reasoning patterns. During inference, HiAR-ICL dynamically selects appropriate reasoning patterns based on problem attributes, providing explicit guidance for the model's reasoning process. Experiments demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness and efficiency: utilizing only 200 prior samples with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, our method achieves 80.6% accuracy on MATH and 62.5% on AMC, exceeding GPT-4o's 77.2% and 57.5%. Our approach enhances performance across models of varying sizes while generalizing effectively across domains. Further analysis reveals that HiAR-ICL can also serve as a plug-and-play inference method compatible with post-training techniques like GRPO.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Loneliness negatively affects mental and physical health, and LLMs might help alleviate it; however, their current use poses risks.

**Method:** Analyzed user interactions with ChatGPT, focusing on dialogues indicating loneliness and classified responses to sensitive scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analyzed the unintended use of ChatGPT in the context of loneliness.
	2. Identified significant failure in managing sensitive topics like suicidal ideation.
	3. Documented a higher incidence of toxic interactions, especially against women.

**Result:** Users in lonely scenarios sought advice or validation, however, ChatGPT struggled with sensitive topics, leading to a higher incidence of toxic responses.

**Limitations:** The paper does not explore potential solutions in depth; focus is mainly on problems.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights significant ethical and legal challenges with LLMs in addressing loneliness, urging research and industry representatives to take action.

**Abstract:** Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide. Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22x more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations to research and industry to address loneliness.

**Motivation:** To find better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity in training large language models, addressing the limitations of current datasets like FineWeb-Edu and DCLM.

**Method:** The authors utilize classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduce reliance on heuristic filters to curate a more effective dataset for model training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel dataset with significantly more unique tokens than competitors.
	2. Demonstration of improved model accuracy using better data selection strategies.
	3. Unlocking advanced training possibilities for long token horizons.

**Result:** Using their methods, the paper reports a 5.6 point improvement over DCLM on MMLU with a high-quality subset for 1T tokens, and superior performance on diverse benchmarks with a dataset consisting of 7.2T tokens.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new dataset enables state-of-the-art training capabilities, outperforming existing models like Llama 3.1 and demonstrating the potential of improved data handling techniques.

**Abstract:** Recent English Common Crawl datasets like FineWeb-Edu and DCLM achieved significant benchmark gains via aggressive model-based filtering, but at the cost of removing 90% of data. This limits their suitability for long token horizon training, such as 15T tokens for Llama 3.1. In this paper, we show how to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens, using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM, demonstrating the efficacy of our methods for boosting accuracies over a relatively short token horizon. Furthermore, our full 6.3T token dataset matches DCLM on MMLU, but contains four times more unique real tokens than DCLM. This unlocks state-of-the-art training over a long token horizon: an 8B parameter model trained for 15T tokens, of which 7.2T came from our dataset, is better than the Llama 3.1 8B model: +5 on MMLU, +3.1 on ARC-Challenge, and +0.5 on average across ten diverse tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces CNNSum, a benchmark for long-context summarization.
	2. Findings indicate that small LLMs may outperform larger models in specific contexts.
	3. Provides insights into the connection between prompt types and model performance in summarization tasks.

**Result:** Advanced LLMs produce vague summaries due to subjective commentary, and smaller LLMs can be more cost-effective. Careful selection of interpolation methods can significantly enhance performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The release of CNNSum is intended to provide a robust framework for continuing research in long-context summarization using LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been well-researched in various long-context tasks. However, the scarcity of long-context summarization datasets hinders progress in this area. To address this, we introduce CNNSum, a multi-scale long-context summarization benchmark based on Chinese novels, featuring human-driven annotations across four subsets totaling 695 samples, with lengths ranging from 16k to 128k. We benchmark numerous LLMs and conduct detailed human assessments to summarize abnormal output types. Furthermore, we extensively explore how to improve long-context summarization. In our study: (1) Advanced LLMs may generate much subjective commentary, leading to vague summaries. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability. The advantages of Large LLMs are hard to utilize, thus small LLMs are more cost-effective. (3) Different prompt types paired with various version models may cause large performance gaps. In further fine-tuning, these can be mitigated, and the Base version models perform better. (4) LLMs with RoPE-base scaled exhibit strong extrapolation potential; using short-context data can significantly improve long-context summarization performance. However, further applying other interpolation methods requires careful selection. (5) CNNSum provides more reliable evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance future research.(https://github.com/CxsGhost/CNNSum)

**Conclusion:** RARE is established as a scalable solution for enhancing reasoning quality in LLMs, particularly in areas requiring logical coherence and factual integrity.

**Abstract:** This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively addresses the example selection challenge in low-resource Indic languages, improving ICL performance and facilitating better generalization and reduced bias in language model applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capabilities through in-context learning (ICL). However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the choice of few-shot demonstrations, making the selection of the most optimal examples a persistent research challenge. This issue is further amplified in low-resource Indic languages, where the scarcity of ground-truth data complicates the selection process. In this work, we propose PromptRefine, a novel Alternating Minimization approach for example selection that improves ICL performance on low-resource Indic languages. PromptRefine leverages auxiliary example banks from related high-resource Indic languages and employs multi-task learning techniques to align language-specific retrievers, enabling effective cross-language retrieval. Additionally, we incorporate diversity in the selected examples to enhance generalization and reduce bias. Through comprehensive evaluations on four text generation tasks -- Cross-Lingual Question Answering, Multilingual Question Answering, Machine Translation, and Cross-Lingual Summarization using state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA-3.1-8B, LLAMA-2-7B, Qwen-2-7B, and Qwen-2.5-7B, we demonstrate that PromptRefine significantly outperforms existing frameworks for retrieving examples.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of KnowShiftQA, a dataset for assessing RAG systems in K-12 Education concerning knowledge discrepancies between textbooks and LLMs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges RAG systems face due to discrepancies between authoritative textbook knowledge and the parametric knowledge of LLMs.

**Method:** The dataset KnowShiftQA simulates knowledge discrepancies through hypothetical updates to answers and source documents, featuring 3,005 questions across five subjects with a focus on context usage and knowledge integration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the KnowShiftQA dataset for RAG systems
	2. Comprehensive examination of RAG system performance under knowledge discrepancies
	3. Identification of challenges in integrating textbook and LLM knowledge

**Result:** Most RAG systems demonstrate a significant performance drop when confronted with knowledge discrepancies; integration of contextual and parametric knowledge is notably challenging for LLMs.

**Limitations:** The dataset is focused on K-12 education and may not generalize to other domains; performance metrics are limited to current RAG systems.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the vulnerabilities of current RAG systems in the education domain and suggest areas for improvement in integrating different knowledge types.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The framework addresses issues like verbosity bias and inconsistencies in model evaluation, offering a detailed analysis of LLM strengths and weaknesses.

**Abstract:** We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the strengths of large language models in answering questions, they lack the ability to actively question and refine their knowledge. This paper aims to address that limitation.

**Method:** The authors introduce INTERACT, a framework where a 'student' LLM engages with a 'teacher' LLM through iterative questioning to acquire knowledge over 1,347 different contexts.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that interactive learning can provide up to a 25% performance improvement, with cold-start student models matching static baselines in as few as five dialogue turns.

**Limitations:** The performance of the approach may vary based on the quality and structure of the teacher model used.

**Conclusion:** The study shows that interactive learning setups are robust and can effectively compensate for weaker teachers, highlighting the advantages of a question-driven approach in LLM learning.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at answering questions but remain passive learners-absorbing static data without the ability to question and refine knowledge. This paper explores how LLMs can transition to interactive, question-driven learning through student-teacher dialogues. We introduce INTERACT (INTERactive learning for Adaptive Concept Transfer), a framework in which a "student" LLM engages a "teacher" LLM through iterative inquiries to acquire knowledge across 1,347 contexts, including song lyrics, news articles, movie plots, academic papers, and images. Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with 'cold-start' student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how different choices in language modeling, specifically token granularity, influence the predictive power of language model surprisal in understanding human reading processing.

**Method:** Experiments manipulating token granularity and evaluating its impact on the predictive power of surprisal through reading times in naturalistic text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the influence of subword token granularity on language model performance.
	2. Showed that finer granularity improves the predictive power of surprisal for reading times.
	3. Provided evidence that coarser tokens heightened surprisal in garden-path situations.

**Result:** The experiments revealed that a vocabulary size of 8,000 tokens produced the most predictive surprisal, while coarser tokens resulted in higher surprisal for garden-path constructions, indicating an enhanced sensitivity to reading difficulties.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Token granularity plays a significant role in the quality of language model surprisal, which is crucial for cognitive modeling of human reading processes.

**Abstract:** Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental processing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices in language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to critical regions, suggesting a greater sensitivity to garden-path effects than previously reported. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of token granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To provide a comprehensive mapping of operations implemented by attention heads in large language models, a topic that has not been fully explored in prior work.

**Method:** The authors propose MAPS, which infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, enabling the analysis of head operations without model training or inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of MAPS framework for mapping attention heads' functionality
	2. Correlational analysis demonstrating MAPS efficacy with LLMs
	3. Revelation of overlooked operations and insights on model architecture biases

**Result:** Evaluation of MAPS on 20 operations across 6 LLMs shows strong correlation with head outputs during inference, revealing overlooked attention head operations, and insights into function universality and architecture biases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MAPS offers valuable insights into attention head functionalities and supports an automatic pipeline for characterizing operations, producing plausible descriptions for most heads.

**Abstract:** Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how autoregressive transformers adaptively learn through in-context learning (ICL) is crucial for improving their task performance.

**Method:** The study utilizes an encoding-decoding framework to examine the formation of task vectors in transformers during pretraining. It analyzes a small transformer on synthetic ICL tasks and investigates the emergence of task encoding and decoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the use of an encoding-decoding framework for studying task vector formation.
	2. Demonstrates the concurrent improvement of task encoding and conditional decoding algorithms during pretraining.
	3. Shows that finetuning earlier layers can enhance task encoding and ICL performance more effectively than later layers.

**Result:** The research finds that as the model learns to encode diverse tasks into separable representations, it concurrently enhances conditional decoding algorithms, ultimately improving ICL performance.

**Limitations:** Focused on synthetic tasks and may need further exploration in more complex real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The quality of task encoding significantly predicts ICL performance. Interestingly, finetuning earlier layers can yield better task encoding enhancements than finetuning later layers. Insights from this study improve understanding of large language models' success and failure modes.

**Abstract:** Autoregressive transformers exhibit adaptive learning through in-context learning (ICL), which begs the question of how. Prior works have shown that transformers represent the ICL tasks as vectors in their representations. In this paper, we leverage the encoding-decoding framework to study how transformers form task vectors during pretraining and how their task encoding quality predicts ICL task performance. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of task encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent tasks (e.g., "Finding the first noun in a sentence.") into distinct, separable representations, it concurrently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improves its ICL performance. We validate this phenomenon across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B) and over the course of pretraining in OLMo-7B. Further, we demonstrate that the quality of task encoding inferred from representations predicts ICL performance, and that, surprisingly, finetuning the earlier layers can improve the task encoding and performance more than finetuning the latter layers. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for lexical semantic change detection provide limited insights at the individual usage instance level; this paper aims to enhance understanding of semantic shifts over time.

**Method:** The authors utilize Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) on sets of contextualized word embeddings to capture and measure semantic changes through the concept of Sense Usage Shift (SUS), which quantifies frequency changes in word senses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Sense Usage Shift (SUS) for quantifying semantic changes at usage instances
	2. Application of Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to contextualized embeddings for enhanced semantic change analysis
	3. Unified approach to tackle multiple challenges in semantic change detection

**Result:** The paper demonstrates that the SUS measure can effectively address challenges in semantic change detection, including quantifying instance-level changes and broader word-level tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Applying SUS provides a unified approach to understanding and measuring both individual instance changes and overall trends in semantic change.

**Abstract:** Lexical semantic change detection aims to identify shifts in word meanings over time. While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning.

**Result:** Llama outperforms other LLMs in accurately representing German subpopulations, particularly those with lower opinion diversity, and demonstrates varying accuracy based on political party support.

**Limitations:** The study is constrained by the specifics of the German political landscape and may not generalize to other cultures or electoral systems.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the need for better alignment of LLMs to capture diverse public opinions while reducing political biases and improving representativeness.

**Abstract:** In recent research, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to investigate public opinions. This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.

**Conclusion:** The findings stress the need for improved models in detecting factual inconsistencies and generating relevant explanations in summarization tasks.

**Abstract:** Detecting factual inconsistencies in summarization is critical, yet existing benchmarks lack the necessary challenge and interpretability for robust evaluation. In this paper, we introduce SummExecEdit, a novel pipeline and benchmark leveraging executable edits to assess models on their ability to both detect factual errors and provide accurate explanations. The top-performing model, Claude3-Opus, achieves a joint detection and explanation score of only 0.49 in our benchmark, with individual scores of 0.67 for detection and 0.73 for explanation. We conduct detailed evaluations to assess the current state of models in this field and find that more than half of the 20+ LLMs in our study struggle with over 30% of the SummExecEdit benchmark. Additionally, we identify four primary types of explanation errors, with 45.4% of them involving a focus on completely unrelated parts of the summary.

**Result:** Benchmarking 17 LLMs across eight games reveals that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, showing the limits of current LLM reasoning capabilities even with detailed prompts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GAMEBoT offers a substantial framework for evaluating LLM reasoning by providing a transparent assessment tool that mitigates data contamination risks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand complex reasoning. To track progress, robust benchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial pattern recognition. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the accuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates the risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM competitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing various strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with detailed CoT prompts. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/gamebot

**TL;DR:** SCOPE optimizes KV cache for long-context generation in LLMs, enhancing performance during both prefill and decoding phases.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing KV cache optimizations overlook the decoding phase, leading to performance issues in long-output generation tasks.

**Method:** SCOPE optimizes the KV cache during prefill and decoding phases separately, preserving essential information and selecting heavy hitters using a sliding strategy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the SCOPE framework for KV cache optimization
	2. Maintained essential information during prefill phase
	3. Proposed a sliding strategy to select heavy hitters during decoding phase

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCOPE improves memory usage and performance on LongGenBench, enhancing its applicability to other compression methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SCOPE effectively addresses KV cache limitations in LLMs, providing a systematic approach to optimize decoding without losing critical information.

**Abstract:** Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

**Result:** Finetuning on curated text reduced biases, while direct preference optimization effectively mitigated toxicity. Transferability of these methods from English to non-English languages was established, but often at the cost of decreased generation fluency in non-English languages.

**Limitations:** The study notes a compromise in language generation ability when applying mitigation techniques.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the need for language-specific methods for bias and toxicity mitigation to avoid compromising text generation quality in non-English languages.

**Abstract:** Recent generative large language models (LLMs) show remarkable performance in non-English languages, but when prompted in those languages they tend to express higher harmful social biases and toxicity levels. Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model's bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. We reduce biases by finetuning on curated non-harmful text, but find only direct preference optimization to be effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model's pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at the expense of decreased language generation ability in non-English languages, highlighting the importance of developing language-specific bias and toxicity mitigation methods.

### [336] [Neuron Empirical Gradient: Discovering and Quantifying Neurons Global Linear Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18053)

*Xin Zhao, Zehui Jiang, Naoki Yoshinaga*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Neuron Empirical Gradient, pre-trained language models, knowledge probing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Neuron Empirical Gradient (NEG) to analyze neuron activations in pre-trained language models (PLMs) and their influence on outputs, demonstrating its effectiveness for knowledge representation and language skill probing.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the broader role of neuron activations in PLMs is essential for advancing knowledge editing and enhancing model interpretability.

**Method:** We propose NeurGrad to compute the Neuron Empirical Gradient (NEG), which quantifies the relationship between neuron activations and model outputs. This method allows for large-scale analysis of neuron behavior and skill representation in PLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Neuron Empirical Gradient (NEG) for analyzing neuron behavior in PLMs
	2. Development of NeurGrad for efficient computation of NEG
	3. Demonstration of NEG's effectiveness in representing language skills and model knowledge

**Result:** NEG has shown to effectively capture language skills across various prompts and can represent model knowledge well, evidenced by experiments on the MCEval8k benchmark.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that NEG is a valuable tool for probing language models, showcasing properties like efficiency and robustness in skill representation.

**Abstract:** While feed-forward neurons in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can encode knowledge, past research targeted a small subset of neurons that heavily influence outputs. This leaves the broader role of neuron activations unclear, limiting progress in areas like knowledge editing. We uncover a global linear relationship between neuron activations and outputs using neuron interventions on a knowledge probing dataset. The gradient of this linear relationship, which we call the neuron empirical gradient (NEG), captures how changes in activations affect predictions. To compute NEG efficiently, we propose NeurGrad, enabling large-scale analysis of neuron behavior in PLMs. We also show that NEG effectively captures language skills across diverse prompts through skill neuron probing. Experiments on MCEval8k, a multi-genre multiple-choice knowledge benchmark, support NEG's ability to represent model knowledge. Further analysis highlights the key properties of NEG-based skill representation: efficiency, robustness, flexibility, and interdependency. The code and data are released.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the problem of hallucination in large language models, where generated content can be factually inaccurate, by enhancing factuality in generation processes.

**Method:** EWE integrates a working memory that updates based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing it to correct false claims during generation.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** EWE outperforms strong baselines on long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 6 points without sacrificing helpfulness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The rules for memory updates, configurations of memory units, and the quality of the retrieval datastore are significant factors influencing performance.

**Abstract:** Large language models can generate factually inaccurate content, a problem known as hallucination. Recent works have built upon retrieved-augmented generation to improve factuality through iterative prompting but these methods are limited by the traditional RAG design. To address these challenges, we introduce EWE (Explicit Working Memory), a novel approach that enhances factuality in long-form text generation by integrating a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources. The memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing EWE to rectify false claims during the generation process and ensure more accurate and reliable outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 6 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses. Further analysis reveals that the design of rules for memory updates, configurations of memory units, and the quality of the retrieval datastore are crucial factors for influencing model performance.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** language models, cognitive tasks, task comprehension, machine learning, evaluation methodologies

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the cognitive task performance of language models and the factors affecting their results, suggesting limitations in task comprehension rather than solely cognitive ability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve understanding of language models' performance on cognitive tasks and refine evaluation methodologies.

**Method:** Analyzed open-source language models on cognitive tasks, introduced progressively harder task versions, and employed alternative prompting strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of task comprehension limitations in language models
	2. Introduction of progressively harder cognitive tasks
	3. Alternative prompting strategies to improve task performance

**Result:** Findings indicate that limitations in task comprehension and task set maintenance significantly affect model performance on cognitive tasks.

**Limitations:** The study may not account for all variables influencing cognitive task performance.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests a need to better interpret language model performance data to differentiate between cognitive limitations and task understanding issues.

**Abstract:** Cognitive tasks originally developed for humans are now increasingly used to study language models. While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance is due at least in part to a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. We challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the ongoing conversation around refining methodologies for the cognitive evaluation of language models.

**TL;DR:** CoAM is a comprehensive dataset for identifying multiword expressions (MWEs) using a new annotation interface, enhancing data quality and enabling fine-grained analysis.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address inconsistencies and limitations in existing datasets for multiword expression (MWE) identification, which is essential for tasks like machine translation.

**Method:** The dataset was created through a multi-step process involving human annotation, review, and automated consistency checks. MWEs are tagged with types (Noun, Verb) for detailed error analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new dataset (CoAM) for MWE identification with diverse types
	2. Development of a novel annotation interface
	3. Demonstration of improved performance of a fine-tuned large language model for MWE identification

**Result:** Experiments show that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms existing MWE identification methods on benchmarks, with insights indicating Verb MWEs are easier to identify than Noun MWEs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CoAM provides a reliable and comprehensive dataset that can improve MWE identification and facilitate detailed error analysis.

**Abstract:** Multiword expressions (MWEs) refer to idiomatic sequences of multiple words. MWE identification, i.e., detecting MWEs in text, can play a key role in downstream tasks such as machine translation, but existing datasets for the task are inconsistently annotated, limited to a single type of MWE, or limited in size. To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. Additionally, for the first time in a dataset of MWE identification, CoAM's MWEs are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, enabling fine-grained error analysis. Annotations for CoAM were collected using a new interface created with our interface generator, which allows easy and flexible annotation of MWEs in any form. Through experiments using CoAM, we find that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms MWEasWSD, which achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the DiMSUM dataset. Furthermore, analysis using our MWE type tagged data reveals that Verb MWEs are easier than Noun MWEs to identify across approaches.

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a token-budget-aware framework for reasoning in large language models to reduce token usage while maintaining performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the significant overhead in token usage caused by current reasoning methods in LLMs, which leads to increased costs.

**Method:** The proposed framework dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning tokens based on the complexity of the reasoning problem, optimizing token usage.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a token-budget-aware reasoning framework for LLMs.
	2. Demonstrated reduction in token costs during CoT reasoning with minor performance trade-offs.
	3. Analysis of the impact of token budget selection on reasoning effectiveness.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively reduces token costs in Chain-of-Thought reasoning while minimally impacting performance.

**Limitations:** The performance reduction, while slight, may vary depending on the complexity of reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** Adopting a token-budget-aware approach balances efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning, presenting a practical solution for cost reduction.

**Abstract:** Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning tokens based on the reasoning complexity of each problem. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the lack of research on humblebragging in computational linguistics and its importance for understanding human language nuances.

**Method:** A 4-tuple definition of humblebragging is proposed, and machine learning, deep learning, and LLMs are evaluated against humans on this task using a newly released dataset, HB-24.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the task of humblebragging detection in computational linguistics.
	2. Created and released the HB-24 dataset for training and evaluation.
	3. Demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting humblebragging.

**Result:** The best model achieves an F1-score of 0.88, indicating the complexity of detecting humblebragging even for humans.

**Limitations:** Detection remains difficult, with even the best models only achieving moderate accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The research establishes a foundational understanding for integrating humblebragging detection into natural language understanding systems.

**Abstract:** Humblebragging is a phenomenon in which individuals present self-promotional statements under the guise of modesty or complaints. For example, a statement like, "Ugh, I can't believe I got promoted to lead the entire team. So stressful!", subtly highlights an achievement while pretending to be complaining. Detecting humblebragging is important for machines to better understand the nuances of human language, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis and intent recognition. However, this topic has not yet been studied in computational linguistics. For the first time, we introduce the task of automatically detecting humblebragging in text. We formalize the task by proposing a 4-tuple definition of humblebragging and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) on this task, comparing their performance with humans. We also create and release a dataset called HB-24, containing 3,340 humblebrags generated using GPT-4o. Our experiments show that detecting humblebragging is non-trivial, even for humans. Our best model achieves an F1-score of 0.88. This work lays the foundation for further exploration of this nuanced linguistic phenomenon and its integration into broader natural language understanding systems.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the unique challenges posed by no-resource languages in machine translation and to propose innovative approaches for effective translation.

**Method:** The paper investigates three workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with LLMs through chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces innovative workflows for no-resource language translation using LLMs.
	2. Demonstrates that traditional MT methods fail for no-resource languages.
	3. Establishes no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm.

**Result:** Empirical findings show that LLMs can effectively translate no-resource languages, with chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforming other methods and rivaling human translations, particularly for larger corpora.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes that no-resource translation requires fundamentally different approaches than low-resource scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of LLMs in this context.

**Abstract:** No-resource languages - those with minimal or no digital representation - pose unique challenges for machine translation (MT). Unlike low-resource languages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages often have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores the problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate that no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from low-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such as those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal that, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning capabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource language translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and rivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting exhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are language-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks from a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input. These findings establish no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm requiring innovative solutions, providing practical and theoretical insights for language preservation.

**Motivation:** To study and improve the generalizable first-order logical reasoning capabilities of transformers, identifying key factors affecting their performance.

**Method:** The authors conducted experiments to measure transformers' performance in answering knowledge graph queries while analyzing distribution shifts in out-of-distribution generalization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of TEGA, a new architecture for improved first-order reasoning
	2. Identification of factors influencing transformers' reasoning capabilities
	3. Establishment of connections between reasoning tasks and distribution shifts

**Result:** Transformers showed superior performance over prior methods for first-order reasoning tasks, and the paper provides empirical evidence on the effects of various architectural choices.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Introducing TEGA, a logic-aware transformer architecture, significantly improves transformers' reasoning abilities in first-order entailment.

**Abstract:** Transformers, as the fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated great capability in reasoning. This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers outperform previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a questionnaire-guided screening framework combining psychological assessments with social media data using adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance mental health assessment by integrating social media content with standardized clinical questionnaires, thereby bridging computational approaches and psychological practices.

**Method:** A novel framework that retrieves relevant social media posts for each questionnaire item and utilizes Large Language Models to complete validated psychological instruments, specifically the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of social media data with standardized psychological assessments
	2. Demonstrating superior performance with minimal to no training requirements
	3. Providing interpretable results aligned with clinical diagnostic criteria

**Result:** The proposed approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on Reddit-based benchmarks without requiring training data, and provides more interpretable assessments that link model outputs to clinical criteria.

**Limitations:** The method is primarily validated with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and may require further testing across diverse mental health conditions.

**Conclusion:** The framework shows the potential for using LLMs as psychological assessors beyond depression screening, applicable to various mental health conditions.

**Abstract:** In psychological practices, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental health through structured, clinically-validated questions (i.e., items). While social media platforms offer rich data for mental health screening, computational approaches often bypass these established clinical assessment tools in favor of black-box classification. We propose a novel questionnaire-guided screening framework that bridges psychological practice and computational methods through adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (\textit{aRAG}). Our approach links unstructured social media content and standardized clinical assessments by retrieving relevant posts for each questionnaire item and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete validated psychological instruments. Our findings demonstrate two key advantages of questionnaire-guided screening: First, when completing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on Reddit-based benchmarks without requiring training data. Second, we show that guiding LLMs through standardized questionnaires can yield superior results compared to directly prompting them for depression screening, while also providing a more interpretable assessment by linking model outputs to clinically validated diagnostic criteria. Additionally, we show, as a proof-of-concept, how our questionnaire-based methodology can be extended to other mental conditions' screening, highlighting the promising role of LLMs as psychological assessors.

**Conclusion:** Improving abnormality detection greatly enhances the overall capability of medical large vision-language models.

**Abstract:** Existing Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), encapsulating extensive medical knowledge, demonstrate excellent capabilities in understanding medical images. However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed to unveil medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Relevance Reward, Abnormal Localization Reward and Vision Relevance Reward. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM significantly outperforms existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormalities, achieving a 58% improvement over the baseline. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.

**Motivation:** To alleviate the burden on legal experts by automating legal interpretation due to its time-consuming and expensive nature in traditional practices.

**Method:** ATRIE emulates doctrinal legal research by utilizing LLMs to retrieve information, interpret legal concepts, and evaluate the interpretations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of ATRIE framework for legal interpretation
	2. Use of LLMs for interpreting legal concepts
	3. Introduction of Legal Concept Entailment task as a proxy for evaluation

**Result:** Automated evaluations indicate that ATRIE's interpretations are comparable in quality to those of legal experts, with improved comprehensiveness and readability, despite a slight accuracy gap.

**Limitations:** A slight gap in accuracy compared to legal experts remains.

**Conclusion:** ATRIE can assist legal practitioners, enhancing the efficiency of legal interpretations without fully replacing expert judgment.

**Abstract:** Interpreting the law is always essential for the law to adapt to the ever-changing society. It is a critical and challenging task even for legal practitioners, as it requires meticulous and professional annotations and summarizations by legal experts, which are admittedly time-consuming and expensive to collect at scale. To alleviate the burden on legal experts, we propose a method for automated legal interpretation. Specifically, by emulating doctrinal legal research, we introduce a novel framework, ATRIE, to address Legal Concept Interpretation, a typical task in legal interpretation. ATRIE utilizes large language models (LLMs) to AuTomatically Retrieve concept-related information, Interpret legal concepts, and Evaluate generated interpretations, eliminating dependence on legal experts. ATRIE comprises a legal concept interpreter and a legal concept interpretation evaluator. The interpreter uses LLMs to retrieve relevant information from previous cases and interpret legal concepts. The evaluator uses performance changes on Legal Concept Entailment, a downstream task we propose, as a proxy of interpretation quality. Automated and multifaceted human evaluations indicate that the quality of our interpretations is comparable to those written by legal experts, with superior comprehensiveness and readability. Although there remains a slight gap in accuracy, it can already assist legal practitioners in improving the efficiency of legal interpretation.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that PGraphRAG significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art personalization methods in various tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PGraphRAG showcases the advantages of graph-based retrieval for enhancing personalized text generation in situations with sparse user data.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their ability to deliver personalized and context-aware responses offers transformative potential for improving user experiences. Existing personalization approaches, however, often rely solely on user history to augment the prompt, limiting their effectiveness in generating tailored outputs, especially in cold-start scenarios with sparse data. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PGraphRAG), a framework that leverages user-centric knowledge graphs to enrich personalization. By directly integrating structured user knowledge into the retrieval process and augmenting prompts with user-relevant context, PGraphRAG enhances contextual understanding and output quality. We also introduce the Personalized Graph-based Benchmark for Text Generation, designed to evaluate personalized text generation tasks in real-world settings where user history is sparse or unavailable. Experimental results show that PGraphRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalization methods across diverse tasks, demonstrating the unique advantages of graph-based retrieval for personalization.

**Motivation:** To systematically investigate the relationship between explicit and implicit biases in LLMs, as previous research has mostly focused on explicit bias.

**Method:** A self-reflection-based evaluation framework that measures implicit bias via psychological assessments and explicit bias by prompting LLMs to evaluate their generated content.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** The framework may not encompass all possible biases and could benefit from additional dimensions for comprehensive analysis.

**Conclusion:** Contemporary alignment methods are effective against explicit bias but not for implicit bias, highlighting a critical gap in LLM bias mitigation strategies.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit various biases and stereotypes in their generated content. While extensive research has investigated biases in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, with minimal attention to implicit bias and the relation between these two forms of bias. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on advanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while explicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong stereotypes. We further investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency, examining the effects of training data scale, model size, and alignment techniques. Experimental results indicate that while explicit bias declines with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Moreover, contemporary alignment methods effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating effective source planning and multi-source knowledge enhances the reliability and applicability of large language models in healthcare applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models hold promise for addressing medical challenges, such as medical diagnosis reasoning, research knowledge acquisition, clinical decision-making, and consumer health inquiry support. However, they often generate hallucinations due to limited medical knowledge. Incorporating external knowledge is therefore critical, which necessitates multi-source knowledge acquisition. We address this challenge by framing it as a source planning problem, which is to formulate context-appropriate queries tailored to the attributes of diverse sources. Existing approaches either overlook source planning or fail to achieve it effectively due to misalignment between the model's expectation of the sources and their actual content. To bridge this gap, we present MedOmniKB, a repository comprising multigenre and multi-structured medical knowledge sources. Leveraging these sources, we propose the Source Planning Optimisation method, which enhances multi-source utilisation. Our approach involves enabling an expert model to explore and evaluate potential plans while training a smaller model to learn source alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves multi-source planning performance, enabling the optimised small model to achieve state-of-the-art results in leveraging diverse medical knowledge sources.

**Abstract:** This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The method proves to be effective and efficient for high-load industrial deployment, providing solutions for key challenges in PAVI and releasing code for reproducibility.

**Abstract:** Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial deployment. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Further, it has been successfully deployed on the real-world e-commerce platform Xianyu, processing millions of product listings daily with frequently updated, large-scale attribute taxonomies. We release the code to facilitate reproducibility and future research at https://github.com/SuYindu/TACLR.

**Abstract:** It is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions that involve multiple constraints. However, it is an unexplored area to enhance LLMs' ability to follow soft constraints. To bridge the gap, we initially design a pipeline to construct datasets with high-quality outputs automatically. Additionally, to fully utilize the positive and negative samples generated during the data construction process, we choose Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as the training method. Furthermore, taking into account the difficulty of soft constraints indicated by the number of constraints, we design a curriculum learning training paradigm based on the constraint quantity. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in improving LLMs' soft constraint following ability and analyze the factors driving the improvements.The datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Rainier-rq/FollowSoftConstraint.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** deception detection, adversarial attacks, machine learning, credibility assessment, language models

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This study explores the impact of adversarial attacks on deception detection in both human judgments and machine learning models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to address the challenges posed by automated adversarial attacks that can make deceptive statements appear truthful, thereby complicating the credibility assessment process.

**Method:** The study utilized a dataset of autobiographical stories, where deceptive statements were rewritten by a language model. Two studies were conducted, one assessing human and machine judgments on original and modified statements and another manipulating the alignment of these modifications with the targets being assessed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the effectiveness of language models in rewriting deceptive statements.
	2. Highlighted the vulnerability of both human and automated deception detection systems to adversarial attacks.
	3. Proposed future directions for research on deception detection and adversarial strategies.

**Result:** Findings revealed that when modifications were aligned with their intended assessment target, both human and machine judgments dropped to chance levels. When misaligned, judgments showed improved accuracy, highlighting vulnerabilities in deception detection systems.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focused on autobiographical stories, which may limit generalizability to other forms of deceptive communication.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that language models can facilitate deceptive tactics that challenge the integrity of both human and machine judgments, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness.

**Abstract:** Background: Deception detection through analysing language is a promising avenue using both human judgments and automated machine learning judgments. For both forms of credibility assessment, automated adversarial attacks that rewrite deceptive statements to appear truthful pose a serious threat. Methods: We used a dataset of 243 truthful and 262 fabricated autobiographical stories in a deception detection task for humans and machine learning models. A large language model was tasked to rewrite deceptive statements so that they appear truthful. In Study 1, humans who made a deception judgment or used the detailedness heuristic and two machine learning models (a fine-tuned language model and a simple n-gram model) judged original or adversarial modifications of deceptive statements. In Study 2, we manipulated the target alignment of the modifications, i.e. tailoring the attack to whether the statements would be assessed by humans or computer models. Results: When adversarial modifications were aligned with their target, human (d=-0.07 and d=-0.04) and machine judgments (51% accuracy) dropped to the chance level. When the attack was not aligned with the target, both human heuristics judgments (d=0.30 and d=0.36) and machine learning predictions (63-78%) were significantly better than chance. Conclusions: Easily accessible language models can effectively help anyone fake deception detection efforts both by humans and machine learning models. Robustness against adversarial modifications for humans and machines depends on that target alignment. We close with suggestions on advancing deception research with adversarial attack designs and techniques.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but often at the cost of reduced output diversity. This trade-off between diversity and alignment quality remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from curiosity-driven exploration in reinforcement learning, we introduce curiosity-driven RLHF (CD-RLHF), a framework that incorporates intrinsic rewards for novel states, alongside traditional sparse extrinsic rewards, to optimize both output diversity and alignment quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-RLHF through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including text summarization and instruction following. Our approach achieves significant gains in diversity on multiple diversity-oriented metrics while maintaining alignment with human preferences comparable to standard RLHF.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Personalization, Language Models, User Preference, Abductive Reasoning, Human-Computer Interaction

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores how to enhance personalization in language models by inferring user personas from preference data and tailoring responses accordingly.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The current method of aligning LLMs based on user preferences lacks the understanding of why users prefer certain responses, limiting personalization capabilities.

**Method:** The authors propose an approach that consists of two steps: Persona Inference (PI) to deduce user personas from preference data, and Persona Tailoring (PT) to adapt model outputs based on these inferred personas.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Persona Inference (PI) for user persona deduction from preference data.
	2. Development of Persona Tailoring (PT) to train models to customize outputs based on inferred personas.
	3. Evidence that augmented training with PI personas enhances personalization and generalizes well to diverse user-written personas.

**Result:** The study demonstrates that LLMs can accurately infer user personas, leading to improved personalization of outputs, especially for users with less common preferences.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The use of abductive reasoning to interpret user preferences enriches the personalization process for LLMs, shifting the focus from merely identifying the preferred response to understanding the underlying reasons for these preferences.

**Abstract:** LLMs are aligned to follow input instructions by learning which of two responses users prefer for a prompt. However, such preference data do not convey why users prefer responses that are chosen or rejected, so LLMs trained on these datasets cannot tailor responses to varied user needs. To surface these parameters of personalization, we apply abductive reasoning to preference data, inferring needs and interests of users, i.e., personas, that may prefer either response. We test this idea in two steps: Persona Inference (PI), abductively inferring personas of users who prefer chosen or rejected outputs, and Persona Tailoring (PT), training models to tailor outputs to personas from PI. We show: 1) LLMs infer personas accurately explaining why different users may prefer both chosen or rejected outputs; 2) Training on preference data augmented with PI personas via PT boosts personalization and generalizes to supporting user-written personas; and 3) Rejected response personas form harder personalization evaluations, showing PT better aids users with uncommon preferences versus typical alignment methods. We argue for an abductive view of preferences for personalization, asking not only which response is better but when, why, and for whom.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for high-quality distractors in MCQs to better identify misconceptions and gaps in student knowledge.

**Method:** A pairwise ranker was trained to evaluate the plausibility of distractors, followed by training a distractor generator using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based on pairwise distractor rank data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a pairwise ranker to assess distractor plausibility.
	2. Created a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks.
	3. Showed significant improvement in distractor generation effectiveness compared to existing methods.

**Result:** The pairwise ranker achieved ranking accuracy comparable to human experts, while the distractor generator outperformed several baselines in generating plausible distractors, improving item discrimination.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that a structured approach to distractor generation can significantly enhance the effectiveness of MCQs.

**Abstract:** In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ExPerT as an explainable evaluation framework
	2. Improved alignment with human judgments by 7.2%
	3. High usability rating for generated explanations

**Result:** ExPerT shows a 7.2% improvement in alignment with human judgments compared to current evaluation methods, and received a usability rating of 4.7 out of 5 from human evaluators.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ExPerT enhances the evaluation process of personalized text generation by providing explainable, fine-grained evaluations that improve interpretability and usability.

**Abstract:** Evaluating personalized text generated by large language models (LLMs) is challenging, as only the LLM user, i.e., prompt author, can reliably assess the output, but re-engaging the same individuals across studies is infeasible. This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating personalized text generation by introducing ExPerT, an explainable reference-based evaluation framework. ExPerT leverages an LLM to extract atomic aspects and their evidence from the generated and reference texts, match the aspects, and evaluate their alignment based on content and writing style -- two key attributes in personalized text generation. Additionally, ExPerT generates detailed, fine-grained explanations for every step of the evaluation process, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that ExPerT achieves a 7.2% relative improvement in alignment with human judgments compared to the state-of-the-art text generation evaluation methods. Furthermore, human evaluators rated the usability of ExPerT's explanations at 4.7 out of 5, highlighting its effectiveness in making evaluation decisions more interpretable.

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiency of random selection in human evaluation of text generation models, which may not accurately represent model performance while incurring high costs.

**Method:** The paper analyzes various selectors based on variance in automated metrics, diversity in outputs, and Item Response Theory, along with developing source-based estimators for predicting item usefulness without model outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of selectors that improve the efficiency of human evaluation for text generation models.
	2. Introduction of source-based estimators for predicting item usefulness without model outputs.
	3. Demonstration of the efficacy of selectors in machine translation and summarization.

**Result:** Selectors outperforming random selection were identified, including those based on variance and diversity. The proposed methods allowed achieving comparable evaluation results with approximately 70% of the full test data.

**Limitations:** The applicability of the proposed selectors may vary across different tasks and model types beyond those tested in the study.

**Conclusion:** A more efficient approach to selecting informative datapoints for human evaluation in natural language generation tasks is established, resulting in significant cost savings without sacrificing evaluation quality.

**Abstract:** Human evaluation is the gold standard for evaluating text generation models. However, it is expensive. In order to fit budgetary constraints, a random subset of the test data is often chosen in practice for human evaluation. However, randomly selected data may not accurately represent test performance, making this approach economically inefficient for model comparison. Thus, in this work, we develop and analyze a suite of selectors to get the most informative datapoints for human evaluation, taking the evaluation costs into account. We show that selectors based on variance in automated metric scores, diversity in model outputs, or Item Response Theory outperform random selection. We further develop an approach to distill these selectors to the scenario where the model outputs are not yet available. In particular, we introduce source-based estimators, which predict item usefulness for human evaluation just based on the source texts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selectors in two common NLG tasks, machine translation and summarization, and show that only $\sim$70\% of the test data is needed to produce the same evaluation result as the entire data.

**Conclusion:** Findings highlight the need for enhancements in the robustness of MLLMs against negation arguments, fostering the development of more trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation. Our findings provide critical insights for improving the robustness of MLLMs against negation inputs, contributing to the development of more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

**Conclusion:** The results suggest that internalizing reasoning capabilities can significantly improve LLM performance, indicating a promising direction for future LLM development.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models are fully open-sourced.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, autoregressive decoding, text generation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses suboptimalities in autoregressive decoding for LLMs and proposes a selective refinement framework to improve text generation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve text generation in large language models by addressing the inherent suboptimality of autoregressive decoding methods, which do not refine generated content effectively.

**Method:** The authors propose a selective refinement framework that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion for interchangeably refining and generating text during the decoding process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a sliding reflection window for text generation
	2. Development of a pausing criterion for refining generated content
	3. Demonstration of improved efficiency and optimality in text generation processes

**Result:** Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed selective refinement framework achieves a better balance between efficiency and optimality in text generation compared to traditional autoregressive methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach effectively mitigates the issues of suboptimal text generation in autoregressive models by allowing for real-time refinement, leading to improved overall quality of generated responses.

**Abstract:** The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

**Motivation:** To improve language model efficiency by mimicking human language acquisition processes during the critical period of development.

**Method:** Integrating a mechanism that initially constrains working memory in early training stages, then relaxes it exponentially as learning progresses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of dynamic working memory constraints during training

**Result:** The proposed method outperforms conventional training methods without memory constraints or those with static constraints, as shown by targeted syntactic evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach not only suggests new methods for creating data-efficient language models but also reinforces the significance of working memory in language acquisition.

**Abstract:** Large language models possess general linguistic abilities but acquire language less efficiently than humans. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into the training process of language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the role of the developmental characteristics of working memory as the underlying mechanism of the critical period in language acquisition.

**Conclusion:** Enhancing self-correction through the proposed framework leads to better performance in reasoning tasks and informs training for next-generation LLMs.

**Abstract:** Recent reasoning models, such as OpenAI's O1 series, have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks and revealed new test-time scaling laws. Inspired by this, many people have been studying how to train models to achieve effective self-evaluation and self-correction to further enable the scaling paradigm. However, less studied is how to efficiently scale test-time compute from a fixed model, and this remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on enhancing the quality of self-reflection data generation for complex problem-solving at test time, which can also subsequently improve the training of next-generation large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore how systematically triggering a model's self-correction mechanisms can improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose a novel iterative deepening sampling algorithm framework designed to enhance self-correction and generate higher-quality samples. Through extensive experiments on Math500 and AIME benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success rate on difficult tasks and provide detailed ablation studies to analyze its effectiveness across diverse settings.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the pretraining process of LLMs by providing a systematic method for data partitioning instead of relying solely on intuitive heuristics.

**Method:** The FRAME strategy organizes pretraining into four stages based on high and low perplexity data, using two key findings to systematically partition the data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the FRAME strategy for LLM pretraining
	2. Quantitative criteria for data partitioning
	3. Demonstrated significant performance enhancements in benchmark tasks

**Result:** FRAME achieves a 16.8% average improvement over random data organization across MMLU and CMMLU benchmarks for the 3B model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By implementing FRAME, the study shows significant performance improvements in LLMs due to systematic data organization.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced human language understanding and generation, with pretraining data quality and organization being crucial to their performance. Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining strategy (FRAME), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAME achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random across MMLU and CMMLU for the 3B model, effectively boosting LLM performance.

**Motivation:** Investigate whether large language models (LLMs) interpret numbers non-literally, as humans do, especially in the context of hyperbole and pragmatic effects.

**Method:** Systematic comparison of LLM interpretations with human data and computational models of pragmatic reasoning, utilizing the Rational Speech Act framework to test components of reasoning.

	2. Developed and tested chain-of-thought prompting to improve LLM performance
	3. Established a framework for assessing LLM interpretations via human-like reasoning

**Result:** LLMs diverge from human interpretation in significant ways; however, chain-of-thought prompting based on the RSA model improves LLMs' interpretations to align more closely with human-like understanding.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work highlights that computational cognitive models can diagnose differences in interpretation between AI and humans and guide improvements in language understanding in AI systems.

**Abstract:** Humans naturally interpret numbers non-literally, effortlessly combining context, world knowledge, and speaker intent. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) interpret numbers similarly, focusing on hyperbole and pragmatic halo effects. Through systematic comparison with human data and computational models of pragmatic reasoning, we find that LLMs diverge from human interpretation in striking ways. By decomposing pragmatic reasoning into testable components, grounded in the Rational Speech Act framework, we pinpoint where LLM processing diverges from human cognition -- not in prior knowledge, but in reasoning with it. This insight leads us to develop a targeted solution -- chain-of-thought prompting inspired by an RSA model makes LLMs' interpretations more human-like. Our work demonstrates how computational cognitive models can both diagnose AI-human differences and guide development of more human-like language understanding capabilities.

**Motivation:** To highlight the potential misuse of personalized generative AI models in creating convincing impersonations that pose safety risks.

**Method:** The paper analyzes the capabilities of fine-tuning open-source LLMs to create personalized models and outlines the implications for safety and privacy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of safety risks from personalized LLMs
	2. Comparative analysis with traditional deepfake risks
	3. Call for focused research on text-based impersonation risks

**Result:** The authors identify that such technologies facilitate the creation of phishing schemes and deepfake text easily, raising concerns that are not currently addressed by existing research.

**Limitations:** The paper does not provide empirical studies or data to support the claims about risks.

**Conclusion:** The risks associated with LLM-based impersonation require distinct consideration from other deepfake technologies, highlighting a gap in current research.

**Abstract:** The recent surge in high-quality open-source Generative AI text models (colloquially: LLMs), as well as efficient finetuning techniques, have opened the possibility of creating high-quality personalized models that generate text attuned to a specific individual's needs and are capable of credibly imitating their writing style by refining an open-source model with that person's own data. The technology to create such models is accessible to private individuals, and training and running such models can be done cheaply on consumer-grade hardware. While these advancements are a huge gain for usability and privacy, this position paper argues that the practical feasibility of impersonating specific individuals also introduces novel safety risks. For instance, this technology enables the creation of phishing emails or fraudulent social media accounts, based on small amounts of publicly available text, or by the individuals themselves to escape AI text detection. We further argue that these risks are complementary to - and distinct from - the much-discussed risks of other impersonation attacks such as image, voice, or video deepfakes, and are not adequately addressed by the larger research community, or the current generation of open- and closed-source models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the application of chain-of-thought prompting in graphs, which have non-linear structures and often lack textual data.

**Method:** The GCoT framework decomposes adaptation into multiple inference steps involving prompt-based inference, thought generation, and thought-conditioned prompt learning, utilizing a pre-trained graph encoder.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First framework for chain-of-thought prompting in text-free graphs
	2. Decomposed learning process into inference steps
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness on multiple datasets

**Result:** Experiments on eight public datasets showcase the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GCoT framework compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GCoT enables guided learning in text-free graphs, mimicking chain-of-thought prompting in NLP but adapted to the unique structure of graphs.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely unexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design CoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one hand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by complex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual data, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this work, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs, GCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream task into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of prompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt learning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism differs significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a prompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based inference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a ``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step. Conditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on the current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step, repeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate the advantage of our approach.

**Motivation:** The integration of Quality Estimation models into Neural Machine Translation decoding processes aims to improve translation quality in scenarios where reference translations are not available.

**Method:** A uni-directional Quality Estimation model is developed that scores partial translations, coupled with a decoding strategy that incorporates this model for Quality-Aware decoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel token-level QE model for partial translations
	2. Decoding strategy integrating QE for Quality-Aware decoding
	3. Demonstrated significant improvements in document translation tasks

**Result:** The proposed method shows improved translation quality, outperforming standard N-best list re-ranking techniques with state-of-the-art Quality Estimation models, achieving up to 1.39 XCOMET-XXL increase.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of the token-level QE model not only enhances overall translation quality but also significantly benefits tasks such as document translation where traditional methods struggle.

**Abstract:** Quality Estimation (QE) models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) predict the quality of the hypothesis without having access to the reference. An emerging research direction in NMT involves the use of QE models, which have demonstrated high correlations with human judgment and can enhance translations through Quality-Aware Decoding. Although several approaches have been proposed based on sampling multiple candidate translations and picking the best candidate, none have integrated these models directly into the decoding process. In this paper, we address this by proposing a novel token-level QE model capable of reliably scoring partial translations. We build a uni-directional QE model for this, as decoder models are inherently trained and efficient on partial sequences. We then present a decoding strategy that integrates the QE model for Quality-Aware decoding and demonstrate that the translation quality improves when compared to the N-best list re-ranking with state-of-the-art QE models (up to $1.39$ XCOMET-XXL $\uparrow$). Finally, we show that our approach provides significant benefits in document translation tasks, where the quality of N-best lists is typically suboptimal.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed solutions significantly improve the practicality of zero-shot invariant language models for listwise inputs, addressing key limitations in existing approaches.

**Abstract:** Mitigating positional bias of language models (LMs) for listwise inputs is a well-known and important problem (e.g., lost-in-the-middle). While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner (https://github.com/soyoung97/RoToR)

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of GPT-based models in handling low-resource languages and indigenous languages by leveraging UMR for better performance.

**Method:** The research involves testing GPT-4's translation capabilities for three indigenous languages with and without the integration of UMR annotations in the prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of UMR to enhance translation tasks in low-resource languages
	2. Empirical evaluation of UMR's effectiveness with GPT-4 for indigenous languages
	3. Demonstration of statistical improvement in performance with UMR incorporation

**Result:** Integrating UMR into the prompts led to a statistically significant improvement in translation performance for indigenous languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The positive results suggest that UMR could be a useful tool for advancing technologies in low-resource language contexts.

**Abstract:** While ChatGPT and GPT-based models are able to effectively perform many tasks without additional fine-tuning, they struggle with tasks related to extremely low-resource languages and indigenous languages. Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR), a semantic representation designed to capture the meaning of texts in many languages, is well-positioned to be leveraged in the development of low-resource language technologies. In this work, we explore the downstream utility of UMR for low-resource languages by incorporating it into GPT-4 prompts. Specifically, we examine the ability of GPT-4 to perform translation from three indigenous languages (Navajo, Ar\'apaho, and Kukama), with and without demonstrations, as well as with and without UMR annotations. Ultimately, we find that in the majority of our test cases, integrating UMR into the prompt results in a statistically significant increase in performance, which is a promising indication of future applications of the UMR formalism.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the phenomenon of hubness in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), concluding that while hubness exists in high-dimensional data, it does not adversely affect next token prediction but poses risks in representation comparisons using certain distance metrics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how hubness impacts the performance of large language models when processing and comparing high-dimensional representations.

**Method:** The authors prove theoretical properties of the representation comparisons made by LLMs and conduct empirical analyses to observe the effects of hubness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proved that token prediction is unaffected by hubness in LLMs
	2. Demonstrated existence of nuisance hubs with alternative distance measures
	3. Provided guidelines for practitioners on mitigating hubness risks

**Result:** They found that while hubness is prevalent, it does not negatively affect next token prediction in LLMs. However, other distance measures can lead to nuisance hubs, which may require mitigation techniques.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Hubness is common in high-dimensional spaces but is not detrimental for LLM token prediction; however, caution is advised when using Euclidean or cosine distances for comparing representations.

**Abstract:** Hubness, the tendency for a few points to be among the nearest neighbours of a disproportionate number of other points, commonly arises when applying standard distance measures to high-dimensional data, often negatively impacting distance-based analysis. As autoregressive large language models (LLMs) operate on high-dimensional representations, we ask whether they are also affected by hubness. We first prove that the only large-scale representation comparison operation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding vectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the concentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appearance of nuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to a high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a disturbance. They are rather the result of context-modulated frequent tokens often appearing in the pool of likely candidates for next token prediction. However, when other distances are used to compare LLM representations, we do not have the same theoretical guarantees, and, indeed, we see nuisance hubs appear. There are two main takeaways. First, hubness, while omnipresent in high-dimensional spaces, is not a negative property that needs to be mitigated when LLMs are being used for next token prediction. Second, when comparing representations from LLMs using Euclidean or cosine distance, there is a high risk of nuisance hubs and practitioners should use mitigation techniques if relevant.

**Motivation:** The study investigates how user-specific persona sentiment affects the quality of interactions in personalized dialogue systems.

**Method:** The analysis involves conducting large-scale experiments with various polarized user profiles to evaluate dialogue quality and the effects of sentiment. A novel dialogue generation approach was introduced that combines turn-based generation, profile ordering, and sentiment-aware prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of timing and quality of dialogues relative to user persona sentiment
	2. Introduction of a turn-based generation strategy
	3. Development of a sentiment-aware dialogue generation approach

**Result:** Findings reveal that negative personas exacerbate dialogue attributes, while positive personas result in smoother interactions. Weak or neutral sentiments in personas lead to lower dialogue quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By accounting for persona polarity, the proposed method enhances the generation of higher-quality dialogues, providing insights for developing more nuanced dialogue systems.

**Abstract:** Personalized dialogue systems have advanced considerably with the integration of user-specific personas into large language models (LLMs). However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism and sentiment-aware prompting. Our study provides new insights into the sensitivity of LLMs to persona sentiment and offers guidance for developing more robust and nuanced personalized dialogue systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate parallels between attention mechanisms in Transformers and human memory retrieval, particularly using syntactic structures as a representational unit.

**Method:** The study employs Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) to assess the attention mechanisms of TG compared to traditional Transformers, analyzing self-paced reading times as a measure of predictive power.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced Transformer Grammar (TG) as a cognitive model for memory retrieval.
	2. Demonstrated the superior predictive power of TG's attention in reading time analysis.
	3. Highlighted the dual role of memory representations in human sentence processing.

**Result:** TG's attention mechanism shows superior predictive accuracy for reading times over vanilla Transformers, indicating that human sentence processing relies on dual memory representations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings imply that effective human sentence processing combines memory representations based on both syntactic structures and token sequences, with attention functioning as a general memory retrieval algorithm.

**Abstract:** Recent work in computational psycholinguistics has revealed intriguing parallels between attention mechanisms and human memory retrieval, focusing primarily on vanilla Transformers that operate on token-level representations. However, computational psycholinguistic research has also established that syntactic structures provide compelling explanations for human sentence processing that token-level factors cannot fully account for. In this paper, we investigate whether the attention mechanism of Transformer Grammar (TG), which uniquely operates on syntactic structures as representational units, can serve as a cognitive model of human memory retrieval, using Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) as a linking hypothesis between models and humans. Our experiments demonstrate that TG's attention achieves superior predictive power for self-paced reading times compared to vanilla Transformer's, with further analyses revealing independent contributions from both models. These findings suggest that human sentence processing involves dual memory representations -- one based on syntactic structures and another on token sequences -- with attention serving as the general memory retrieval algorithm, while highlighting the importance of incorporating syntactic structures as representational units.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation is an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) for enriching training datasets by generating diverse samples. This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: \textit{Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity}. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}). % \(\mathscr{DoAug}\) Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train an LLM as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases. Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to create a more diverse augmented dataset. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets. The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of \(10.52\%\), surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points.

**Method:** Introduction of MT-RAIG Bench for Retrieval-Augmented Insight Generation over Multiple Tables and a fine-grained evaluation framework, MT-RAIG Eval.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MT-RAIG Bench for multi-table reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** The proposed frameworks have not been applied widely in practical scenarios yet.

**Conclusion:** The proposed frameworks enhance the evaluation of systems generating insights from multiple tables and align better with human quality judgments.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in table-based reasoning have expanded beyond factoid-level QA to address insight-level tasks, where systems should synthesize implicit knowledge in the table to provide explainable analyses. Although effective, existing studies remain confined to scenarios where a single gold table is given alongside the user query, failing to address cases where users seek comprehensive insights from multiple unknown tables. To bridge these gaps, we propose MT-RAIG Bench, design to evaluate systems on Retrieval-Augmented Insight Generation over Mulitple-Tables. Additionally, to tackle the suboptimality of existing automatic evaluation methods in the table domain, we further introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework MT-RAIG Eval, which achieves better alignment with human quality judgments on the generated insights. We conduct extensive experiments and reveal that even frontier LLMs still struggle with complex multi-table reasoning, establishing our MT-RAIG Bench as a challenging testbed for future research.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To theoretically analyze the effectiveness of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which has been shown to perform well empirically but lacks analytical insight.

**Method:** The analysis involves examining the convergence rate of MBR decoding given the size of the reference hypothesis set and comparing its performance to Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analytical proof of MBR decoding's effectiveness
	2. Establishment of convergence rates for MBR decoding
	3. Comparison of performance between MBR and MAP decoding

**Result:** MBR decoding approaches the optimal solution with high probability at a rate of O(n^(-1/2)), indicating faster convergence to the optimal solution than MAP decoding under certain assumptions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support previous empirical evaluations of MBR decoding and highlight its advantages over MAP decoding in terms of convergence speed to optimal solutions.

**Abstract:** Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding optimizes output selection by maximizing the expected utility value of an underlying human distribution. While prior work has shown the effectiveness of MBR decoding through empirical evaluation, few studies have analytically investigated why the method is effective. As a result of our analysis, we show that, given the size $n$ of the reference hypothesis set used in computation, MBR decoding approaches the optimal solution with high probability at a rate of $O\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, under certain assumptions, even though the language space $Y$ is significantly larger $|Y|\gg n$. This result helps to theoretically explain the strong performance observed in several prior empirical studies on MBR decoding. In addition, we provide the performance gap for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding and compare it to MBR decoding. The result of this paper indicates that MBR decoding tends to converge to the optimal solution faster than MAP decoding in several cases.

**Motivation:** To uncover reasoning gaps in Large Language Models as they scale up by exploring their responses to redefined physical constants and units.

**Method:** The study employs a redefinition task where alternative values are assigned to physical constants, and LLMs are evaluated on their ability to respond correctly to these changes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies reasoning gaps in LLMs as they scale up
	2. Demonstrates the impact of redefined physical constants on model performance
	3. Reveals the relationship between model scale and false confidence in responses.

**Result:** The results indicate a deterioration in model performance with scale, alongside a rise in false confidence when responding to assigned alternative values.

**Limitations:** The study focuses solely on physical constants and may not generalize to all types of reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight that despite varying prompting strategies or response formats, LLMs often rely on memorized values, which affects their performance.

**Abstract:** Inverse tasks can uncover potential reasoning gaps as Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up. In this work, we explore the redefinition task, in which we assign alternative values to well-known physical constants and units of measure, prompting LLMs to respond accordingly. Our findings show that not only does model performance degrade with scale, but its false confidence also rises. Moreover, while factors such as prompting strategies or response formatting are influential, they do not preclude LLMs from anchoring to memorized values.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the efficacy of subword versus character language models in understanding word learning and syntactic acquisition.

**Method:** The study employs the psycholinguistic lexical decision task to compare the word and non-word recognition capabilities of subword and character language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of the superior performance of character LMs in lexical tasks.
	2. Identification of the separability of word and syntactic learning in character LMs.
	3. Critical evaluation of the limitations of subword LMs in modeling language acquisition.

**Result:** Character LMs consistently outperform subword LMs in recognizing words and non-words, showcasing a clear separation in learning processes, with character LMs learning words before syntax.

**Limitations:** The study may not account for all possible contexts in which subword LMs can operate effectively.

**Conclusion:** Character language models are suggested as a preferable alternative for modeling language acquisition due to their distinct learning trajectories compared to subword models.

**Abstract:** We study word learning in subword and character language models with the psycholinguistic lexical decision task. While subword LMs struggle to discern words and non-words with high accuracy, character LMs solve this task easily and consistently. Only when supplied with further contexts do subword LMs perform similarly to character models. Additionally, when looking at word-level and syntactic learning trajectories, we find that both processes are separable in character LMs. Word learning happens before syntactic learning, whereas both occur simultaneously in subword LMs. This raises questions about the adequacy of subword LMs for modeling language acquisition and positions character LMs as a viable alternative to study processes below the syntactic level.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods focus on optimizing single aspects of LLM evaluation prompts but overlook the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, hindering the effectiveness of the evaluation pipeline.

**Method:** HPSS uses an iterative search algorithm inspired by genetic algorithms, employing a heuristic function to identify and optimize effective prompting strategies across multiple evaluation factors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS) method
	2. Integration of 8 key factors for prompt evaluation
	3. Demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods

**Result:** HPSS consistently outperformed human-designed prompts and prior automatic optimization methods in extensive experiments across four evaluation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential of HPSS to significantly enhance LLM evaluation prompt optimization, making it more aligned with human judgment.

**Abstract:** Since the adoption of large language models (LLMs) for text evaluation has become increasingly prevalent in the field of natural language processing (NLP), a series of existing works attempt to optimize the prompts for LLM evaluators to improve their alignment with human judgment. However, their efforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts, such as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the evaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting strategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To this end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and propose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm, HPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for LLM evaluators. A heuristic function is employed to guide the search process, enhancing the performance of our algorithm. Extensive experiments across four evaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently outperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic prompt optimization methods.

**Limitations:** Further exploration needed on the long-term impacts of reduced human-like tone in diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** DumT offers a practical method to control human-like tone in LLM outputs while maintaining performance, aiming to mitigate risks of anthropomorphism.

**Abstract:** Should LLMs generate language that makes them seem human? Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to deception, overreliance, and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs in many contexts. HumT also offers insights into the perceptions and impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating risks associated with anthropomorphic language generation.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the inadequacy of existing alignment techniques that model a monolithic preference, particularly in health contexts where diverse perspectives are crucial.

**Method:** The authors introduce VITAL, a dataset containing 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions related to health, and evaluate eight different LLMs against it.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the VITAL benchmark dataset for health-related pluralistic alignment
	2. Evaluation of pluralistic alignment techniques on multiple LLMs
	3. Identification of gaps in current alignment techniques for diverse healthcare beliefs

**Result:** The evaluation demonstrates that current pluralistic alignment techniques fail to effectively accommodate the diversity of healthcare beliefs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate a need for specific alignment approaches in health domains, highlighting limitations in current methodologies.

**Abstract:** Alignment techniques have become central to ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate outputs consistent with human values. However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities. This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions. Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains. This work highlights the limitations of current approaches and lays the groundwork for developing health-specific alignment solutions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the effectiveness of diffusion LMs for instruction-following tasks and their controllability based on compute usage during inference.

**Abstract:** We introduce TESS 2, a general instruction-following diffusion language model that outperforms contemporary instruction-tuned diffusion models, as well as matches and sometimes exceeds strong autoregressive (AR) models. We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide practical insights for optimizing agentic RAG by evaluating different reward sources and understanding scaling properties.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown great promise for knowledge-intensive tasks and recently advanced with agentic RAG, where language agents engage in multi-round interactions with external knowledge sources for adaptive information retrieval. However, existing agentic RAG methods often depend on ad-hoc prompt engineering and lack a unified optimization framework. We introduce RAG-Gym, a comprehensive platform that systematically explores three optimization dimensions: (1) prompt engineering, (2) actor tuning, and (3) critic training. For prompt engineering, we propose Re$^2$Search, a novel agent incorporating reasoning reflection that significantly outperforms standard prompts. In actor tuning, we evaluate three popular post-training algorithms with fine-grained process supervision and identify direct preference optimization as the most effective. We further demonstrate that a trained critic can enhance inference by selecting higher-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Together, these findings lead to the optimized Re$^2$Search++ agent, which surpasses most recent methods like Search-R1 by a relative increase of 3.2% to 11.6% in average F1. Finally, we examine the impact of different reward sources and analyze scaling properties in training and inference, offering practical insights for agentic RAG optimization.

*Nishant Balepur, Rachel Rudinger, Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** MCQA, LLM evaluation, generative formats, educational testing, item response theory

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper critiques multiple choice question answering (MCQA) for LLM evaluation and proposes generative formats for better alignment with user needs and knowledge.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve the effectiveness of LLM evaluation by addressing the shortcomings of MCQA, which fails to adequately assess generation, subjectivity, and knowledge.

**Method:** The authors analyze the flaws of MCQA datasets and propose reform methods from educational testing, including rubric-based guidance for question writing and scoring methods to minimize guessing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of MCQA for LLM evaluation
	2. Proposal of generative answer formats
	3. Educational reforms for MCQA question design

**Result:** The paper identifies several issues with MCQA datasets such as leakage, unanswerability, and biases, and presents fixes, demonstrating that a generative format can better capture LLM capabilities.

**Limitations:** Some LLM errors and biases still persist, indicating that while improvements can be made, challenges in LLM evaluations remain.

**Conclusion:** The study advocates for refining MCQA while integrating ideas from educational testing to enhance evaluation measures, suggesting that improvements are essential rather than completely abandoning the MCQA format.

**Abstract:** Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) is popular for LLM evaluation due to its simplicity and human-like testing, but we argue for its reform. We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing, where LLMs construct and explain answers, better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA, robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations, showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the task based on educational testing, advancing evaluations.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how language models manage temporally changing facts, identifying specific attention heads called Temporal Heads that handle this knowledge.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to fill the gap in understanding how language models cope with facts that change over time, a topic that has been largely overlooked despite the models' ability to retrieve static information.

**Method:** The authors employed circuit analysis to identify and analyze Temporal Heads across different language models, observing their behavior with respect to varying types of temporal knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of Temporal Heads in language models for handling temporal knowledge
	2. Demonstration of the varying activation of these heads based on numeric and textual temporal cues
	3. Potential for editing temporal knowledge by adjusting the values in Temporal Heads.

**Result:** The research found that disabling the Temporal Heads hinders the models' performance in recalling time-specific facts without affecting their general capabilities, illustrating the heads' crucial role in managing temporal knowledge.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The presence of Temporal Heads was confirmed in multiple models, indicating that language models possess specialized mechanisms for handling temporal information, which can be modified or edited.

**Abstract:** While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.

**Conclusion:** The availability of SEA-HELM and its leaderboard can significantly enhance the understanding of LLM performance in the Southeast Asian context.

**Abstract:** With the rapid emergence of novel capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for rigorous multilingual and multicultural benchmarks that are integrated has become more pronounced. Though existing LLM benchmarks are capable of evaluating specific capabilities of LLMs in English as well as in various mid- to low-resource languages, including those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region, a comprehensive and culturally representative evaluation suite for the SEA languages has not been developed thus far. Here, we present SEA-HELM, a holistic linguistic and cultural LLM evaluation suite that emphasises SEA languages, comprising five core pillars: (1) NLP Classics, (2) LLM-specifics, (3) SEA Linguistics, (4) SEA Culture, (5) Safety. SEA-HELM currently supports Filipino, Indonesian, Tamil, Thai, and Vietnamese. We also introduce the SEA-HELM leaderboard, which allows users to understand models' multilingual and multicultural performance in a systematic and user-friendly manner. We make the SEA-HELM evaluation code publicly available.

**Motivation:** Address the lack of widely available clinical datasets due to privacy risks by utilizing synthetic data generation techniques.

**Method:** Domain-adapt large language models to generate synthetic clinical texts annotated for personally identifiable information using encoder-based NER models; train synthetic NER models on these datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Methodology for generating synthetic clinical texts using LLMs
	2. Evaluation of NER models trained on synthetic versus original datasets
	3. Insights on dataset size requirements for effective LLM adaptation

**Result:** Synthetic NER models trained with synthetic corpora show only a small decrease in predictive performance compared to models trained on original data.

**Limitations:** The process's effectiveness greatly relies on the quality of the original data's NER models.

**Conclusion:** Smaller datasets can be effective for adapting LLMs for data synthesis; however, the success depends largely on the machine-annotating NER models' quality trained on original data.

**Abstract:** Many sensitive domains -- such as the clinical domain -- lack widely available datasets due to privacy risks. The increasing generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made synthetic datasets a viable path forward. In this study, we domain-adapt LLMs to the clinical domain and generate synthetic clinical texts that are machine-annotated with tags for personally identifiable information using capable encoder-based NER models. The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study -- using both Swedish and Spanish data. Our analysis shows that smaller datasets can be sufficient for domain-adapting LLMs for data synthesis. Instead, the effectiveness of this process is almost entirely contingent on the performance of the machine-annotating NER models trained using the original data.

**Result:** Training Japanese LMMs with PDF-derived data resulted in performance improvements ranging from 2.1% to 13.8% on the Japanese LMM Benchmark (Heron-Bench).

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PDF-derived data proves to be a valuable multimodal resource, enhancing the performance of Japanese LMMs and enabling better cultural representation.

**Abstract:** Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in English, but their effectiveness in Japanese remains limited due to the lack of high-quality training data. Current Japanese LMMs often rely on translated English datasets, restricting their ability to capture Japan-specific cultural knowledge. To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 2.1% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench. Further analysis highlights the impact of PDF-derived data on various factors, such as model size and language models, reinforcing its value as a multimodal resource for Japanese LMMs.

	3. Theoretical substantiation of using log-likelihood vectors as model coordinates.

**Result:** The approach was applied to over 1,000 language models, resulting in a 'model map' that visually represents the relationships and differences between these models based on performance metrics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This method offers a new perspective for large-scale model analysis and can facilitate more informed choices in model selection.

**Abstract:** To compare autoregressive language models at scale, we propose using log-likelihood vectors computed on a predefined text set as model features. This approach has a solid theoretical basis: when treated as model coordinates, their squared Euclidean distance approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of text-generation probabilities. Our method is highly scalable, with computational cost growing linearly in both the number of models and text samples, and is easy to implement as the required features are derived from cross-entropy loss. Applying this method to over 1,000 language models, we constructed a "model map," providing a new perspective on large-scale model analysis.

**Method:** Systematic analysis of 11 existing diversity measurement methods; introduction of NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level novelty; extensive fine-tuning experiments to evaluate correlation with model performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NovelSum as a new diversity metric based on novelty.
	2. Systematic evaluation of diversity measurement methods and their correlation with model performance.
	3. Development of a diversity-oriented data selection strategy that enhances model performance.

**Result:** NovelSum captures diversity variations with 0.97 correlation to instruction-tuned model performance; development of a new data selection strategy that outperforms existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** NovelSum is a reliable metric for guiding data engineering in large language models, showing practical significance through improved model performance.

**Abstract:** Data diversity is crucial for the instruction tuning of large language models. Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information density in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level "novelty." Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore if language models can mirror human inductive biases in language learning despite architectural differences.

**Method:** The authors trained LMs on 12 languages from 4 families, focusing on twelve newly constructed parallel corpora to model impossible and typologically unattested languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of LM's ability to differentiate attested vs unattested languages
	2. Exploration of LMs' performance on typologically attested and unattested languages
	3. Introduction of new parallel corpora for language testing

**Result:** GPT-2 small shows the ability to distinguish attested languages from impossible ones but does not achieve perfect separation, and it struggles to distinguish between different NP orders based on typological data.

**Limitations:** The model does not achieve perfect accuracy and biases are not as strong as in human learning.

**Conclusion:** Language models exhibit some similarities to human language learning biases, though they are weaker than those observed in humans.

**Abstract:** Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.

**Motivation:** To improve the authenticity and diversity of user simulations in dialogue systems, addressing limitations in current role-playing methods.

**Method:** Development of an LLM-driven extractor for implicit profiles, followed by refinements using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and implementation of a diverse profile sampler.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Framework for simulating personalized dialogues using implicit user profiles
	2. LLM-driven extractor and comprehensive profile schema
	3. Diverse profile sampler capturing real-world user distribution

**Result:** USP significantly outperforms baselines in authenticity and user diversity, while maintaining conversation-level consistency, and effectively evaluates LLMs on dynamic multi-turn interactions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** USP demonstrates a successful approach for simulating realistic dialogues, providing an effective tool for dialogue system evaluation in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler captures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results show that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while maintaining comparable consistency. Additionally, using USP to evaluate LLM on dynamic multi-turn aligns well with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

**TL;DR:** Introduces FINEREASON, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning processes through multi-step logic puzzles.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of current benchmarks that only assess final-answer accuracy, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps of LLMs.

**Method:** Developed a benchmark featuring logic puzzles decomposable into atomic steps, introducing tasks for state checking and state transition to evaluate reasoning processes comprehensively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the FINEREASON benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning steps
	2. Introduction of state checking and state transition tasks
	3. Demonstrated performance gains in math reasoning tasks related to LLM training.

**Result:** Models trained on the FINEREASON tasks show improved mathematical reasoning performance by up to 5.1% on the GSM8K benchmark.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** FINEREASON enables better evaluation of LLMs' reflective and corrective reasoning capabilities, promoting improved model performance in multi-step reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the effects of tokenizer training data size on natural language processing quality, revealing diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds and providing insights for optimization.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the impact of tokenizer training data size on the effectiveness of various tokenization algorithms in NLP.

**Method:** BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers were trained on English data sizes ranging from 1GB to 900GB to determine the effect of training data size on tokenization quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified practical limits for tokenizer training data size
	2. Provided comparative analysis across English and Russian languages
	3. Informed optimizations in future tokenization research

**Result:** Findings indicate diminishing returns in tokenization quality after approximately 150GB of training data for English and around 200GB for Russian, attributed to the pre-tokenization stage.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study suggests practical limits to training data size benefits in tokenization and provides insights for optimizing future tokenizer algorithms.

**Abstract:** Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is governed by several key parameters, such as the tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, pre-tokenization strategy, inference strategy, and training data corpus. This paper investigates the impact of an often-overlooked hyperparameter, tokenizer training data size. We train BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers across various vocabulary sizes using English training data ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as training data size increases beyond roughly 150GB, suggesting a practical limit to the improvements in tokenization quality achievable through additional data. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to constraints introduced by the pre-tokenization stage. We then demonstrate the extent to which these findings can generalize by experimenting on data in Russian, a language typologically distant from English. While the limit appears to materialize at a later phase of pre-training, around 200GB, it is in fact observed. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process by reducing the compute required for training on large corpora and suggest promising directions for future research in tokenization algorithms.

**Motivation:** The study addresses the gap in grammatical error correction methods for morphologically rich languages like Arabic, focusing on efficiency and interpretability through sequence tagging.

**Method:** The authors introduce a data-derived edit tag approach for text editing in Arabic, investigating the impact of different edit representations on model performance and exploring ensemble models for further improvements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a data-driven edit tag approach for Arabic GEC

**Result:** The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two Arabic grammatical error correction benchmarks and maintains competitive performance on two additional benchmarks, while being over six times faster than existing systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that the proposed method is practical for real-world applications and contributes to the advancement of Arabic grammatical error correction technologies.

**Abstract:** Text editing frames grammatical error correction (GEC) as a sequence tagging problem, where edit tags are assigned to input tokens, and applying these edits results in the corrected text. This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we explore ensemble models, demonstrating how combining different models leads to further performance improvements. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.

**Abstract:** Personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical step in facilitating their widespread application to enhance individual life experiences. In pursuit of personalization, distilling key preference information from an individual's historical data as instructional preference context to customize LLM generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation by overlooking the inter-user comparative analysis, which is essential for identifying the inter-user differences that truly shape preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Difference-aware Personalization Learning (DPL), a novel approach that emphasizes extracting inter-user differences to enhance LLM personalization. DPL strategically selects representative users for comparison and establishes a structured standard to extract meaningful, task-relevant differences for customizing LLM generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPL significantly enhances LLM personalization. We release our code at https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DPL.

**Conclusion:** The framework enables better belief tracking and enriched representations of entity states, making it applicable for complex human interaction tasks.

**Abstract:** Theory-of-Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' perceptions and mental states, is fundamental to human interaction but remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on off-the-shelf LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured knowledge of entity states to build spatial scene graphs for belief tracking across various ToM orders and enrich events with fine-grained entity state details. Experimental results on ToMi, HiToM, and FANToM benchmarks show that EnigmaToM significantly improves ToM reasoning across LLMs of varying sizes, particularly excelling in high-order reasoning scenarios.

**Motivation:** This research addresses the computational challenges in retrieving information for complex multi-hop queries in RAG systems.

**Method:** The proposed L-RAG utilizes a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs, extracting and utilizing intermediate layer representations for external knowledge retrieval.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG) for multi-hop query handling.
	2. Demonstration that intermediate layer representations offer richer information for external knowledge retrieval.

**Result:** L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on various multi-hop question-answering datasets while maintaining similar inference costs to standard RAG.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** L-RAG provides an efficient alternative for multi-hop question answering tasks, balancing performance and computational overhead.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing complex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG. Experimental results show that L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets, including MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

**Conclusion:** There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to mitigate the effects of outdated information in RAG.

**Abstract:** While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/0russwest0/HoH.

**Abstract:** A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context.

To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of LLMs with NMT encoding while retaining traditional decoders

**Conclusion:** The integration of LLMs into NMT demonstrates noteworthy improvements in translation quality and efficiency, suggesting a promising direction for future research in both NMT and general NLP applications.

**Abstract:** The field of neural machine translation (NMT) has changed with the advent of large language models (LLMs). Much of the recent emphasis in natural language processing (NLP) has been on modeling machine translation and many other problems using a single pre-trained Transformer decoder, while encoder-decoder architectures, which were the standard in earlier NMT models, have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we explore translation models that are universal, efficient, and easy to optimize, by marrying the world of LLMs with the world of NMT. We apply LLMs to NMT encoding and leave the NMT decoder unchanged. We also develop methods for adapting LLMs to work better with the NMT decoder. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset involving multiple tasks to assess how well the machine translation system generalizes across various tasks. Evaluations on the WMT and our datasets show that results using our method match or surpass a range of baselines in terms of translation quality, but achieve $2.4 \sim 6.5 \times$ inference speedups and a $75\%$ reduction in the memory footprint of the KV cache. It also demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of translation-related tasks.

	3. Revelation of generalization limitations in state-of-the-art language models

**Result:** Language models demonstrate high accuracy in implicit reasoning with fixed-pattern data but struggle to generalize with unfixed-pattern data, showing signs of shortcut learning.

**Limitations:** The findings indicate that models may rely on shortcut learning, limiting their effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Implicit reasoning allows for strong performance only in specific patterns, and generalization is often compromised due to overfitting.

**Abstract:** Test-time compute is emerging as a new paradigm for enhancing language models' complex multi-step reasoning capabilities, as demonstrated by the success of OpenAI's o1 and o3, as well as DeepSeek's R1. Compared to explicit reasoning in test-time compute, implicit reasoning is more inference-efficient, requiring fewer generated tokens. However, why does the advanced reasoning capability fail to emerge in the implicit reasoning style? In this work, we train GPT-2 from scratch on a curated multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset and conduct analytical experiments to investigate how language models perform implicit reasoning in multi-step tasks. Our findings reveal: 1) Language models can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests via implicit reasoning. However, this capability only emerges when trained on fixed-pattern data. 2) Conversely, implicit reasoning abilities emerging from training on unfixed-pattern data tend to overfit a specific pattern and fail to generalize further. Notably, this limitation is also observed in state-of-the-art large language models. These findings suggest that language models acquire implicit reasoning through shortcut learning, enabling strong performance on tasks with similar patterns while lacking generalization.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Transformers struggle with generalizing to longer sequences than seen during training, known as length extrapolation, highlighting a gap in existing Relative Positional Encoding methods.

**Method:** The proposed method, CABLE, learns token-specific, context-aware biases for attention heads, allowing for dynamic adjustment based on input sequences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a context-aware positional encoding method that adapts to different input contexts.
	2. Demonstrated lower perplexity for long sequences using CABLE with GPT-2.
	3. Enhanced performance in long-context retrieval tasks with BERT base.

**Result:** CABLE achieved lower perplexity on longer sequences with GPT-2 and improved performance on long-context retrieval tasks with BERT base, outperforming traditional RPE methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CABLE significantly enhances length extrapolation in transformers, addressing the limitations of conventional positional encoding approaches tested on standard datasets.

**Abstract:** Transformers often struggle to generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training, a limitation known as length extrapolation. Most existing Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) methods attempt to address this by introducing either fixed linear biases or globally learned biases, which lack the capacity to adapt to different input contexts. In this work, we propose an additive RPE, Context-Aware Biases for Length Extrapolation (CABLE), a method that learns token-specific, context-aware biases for each attention head in transformers. By dynamically adjusting positional biases based on the input sequence, CABLE overcomes the rigidity of fixed RPEs. When evaluated on sequences longer than originally trained with, GPT-2 Medium (334M parameters) with CABLE achieves lower perplexity than counterparts using other widely adopted positional encoding methods. Additionally, by applying CABLE to the BERT base model we improved performance in long-context retrieval tasks. Our method significantly enhances the extrapolation performance of existing RPE methods tested on the FineWeb-Edu10B and WikiText-103 datasets.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a theoretical framework for effective prompt design in large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the importance of task-specific prompts over generic ones in improving performance on reasoning tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses limitations in the Transformer architecture of LLMs concerning complex reasoning tasks and the need for better prompt engineering techniques to enhance their performance.

**Method:** The authors propose a theoretical framework for analyzing prompts as selectors that extract task-relevant information from the model's hidden state during chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. They analyze the complexity of finding optimal prompts and characterize the prompt space for different tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Theoretical framework for understanding prompt effectiveness
	2. Analysis of prompt trajectories in reasoning tasks
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements through optimal prompting

**Result:** Experiments show that employing optimal prompt search strategies can lead to over a 50% improvement in performance on reasoning tasks compared to using generic prompting methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide a theoretical basis for the design of effective prompts, demonstrating that naively guided prompts can hinder performance in reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Despite the remarkable successes of large language models (LLMs), the underlying Transformer architecture has inherent limitations in handling complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical workaround, but most CoT-based methods rely on a single, generic prompt such as "think step by step", with no task-specific adaptation. These approaches expect the model to discover an effective reasoning path on its own, forcing it to search through a vast prompt space. In contrast, several studies have explored task-specific prompt designs to boost performance. However, these designs are typically developed through trial and error, lacking theoretical grounding. As a result, prompt engineering remains largely ad hoc and unguided. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains why some prompts succeed while others fail. We show that prompts function as selectors, extracting task-relevant information from the model's full hidden state during CoT reasoning. Each prompt defines a unique trajectory through the answer space, and the choice of trajectory is crucial for task performance and future navigation within the space. We analyze the complexity of finding optimal prompts and characterize the size of the prompt space for a given task. Our theory reveals principles behind effective prompt design and shows that naive CoT-using self-guided prompts like "think step by step"-can severely hinder performance. Through experiments, we show that optimal prompt search can lead to more than a 50% improvement on reasoning tasks, providing a theoretical foundation for prompt engineering.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ClusComp enables efficient LLM deployment on resource-constrained devices while maintaining high performance through its innovative compression and finetuning approach.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) scale, model compression is crucial for edge deployment and accessibility. Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for improved training and prompting strategies for LLMs to enhance their grounding capabilities in human interactions.

**Abstract:** Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on Rifts, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention aimed at mitigating grounding failures.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces SPILL, a method for intent clustering using Large Language Models (LLMs) without fine-tuning, improving generalizability to new datasets.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the generalizability of existing embedding-based clustering methods without requiring fine-tuning, which limits their use across multiple datasets.

**Method:** The proposed method involves a two-stage process: first deriving embeddings for each input utterance (seed) and then using distance metrics to select a candidate pool and LLMs to refine intent clustering.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SPILL for intent clustering
	2. Demonstration of LLMs in refining clustering tasks
	3. Improvement of existing embedders' adaptability without fine-tuning

**Result:** SPILL outperformed standard embedding methods and achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, showing improved adaptability to new domain datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SPILL method significantly enhances the usability of embeddings for clustering tasks without the need for fine-tuning, allowing for domain customization through LLMs.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning. Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets. Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the sources of human-like syntactic preferences in language models, specifically focusing on the English dative alternation and the effects of length and animacy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand whether human-like preferences in language models stem from direct exposure to syntactic phenomena or from general properties of language.

**Method:** The study uses a controlled rearing paradigm, training small language models on systematically manipulated input and analyzing the effects of length and animacy on dative alternation preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates the dative alternation in language models and its syntactic implications.
	2. Shows the influence of length and animacy on language model behavior.
	3. Demonstrates that indirect evidence can lead to emergent syntactic preferences in language models.

**Result:** The findings indicate that while direct evidence of length and animacy affects language model preferences, certain preferences can still emerge from indirect evidence, highlighting a blend of direct and indirect influences on syntax.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that language models' syntactic preferences arise from both direct exposure to linguistic features and broader global language properties.

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation (DO: "gave Y the X" vs. PO: "gave the X to Y"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on properties that affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come from a mix of direct and indirect sources.

**Motivation:** To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in fact-checking and address the issue of disinformation proliferation.

**Method:** Evaluated the performance of various LLMs, including GPT-4, in fact-checking through three scenarios involving different data access levels, using a dataset of 600 statements from six regions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified regional performance disparities in LLM fact-checking
	2. Proposed the necessity for improved dataset balancing
	3. Highlighted limitations of current retrieval methods in addressing regional nuances

**Result:** LLMs performed significantly better on statements from the Global North, with stark differences in performance noted when utilizing a Wikipedia agent for fact-checking.

**Limitations:** The study may not encompass all potential LLMs or fact-checking contexts beyond the six examined regions.

**Conclusion:** The disparities in LLM performance across geographical regions indicate a need for improved dataset balancing and enhanced retrieval methods for better fact-checking outcomes.

**Abstract:** Fact-checking is a potentially useful application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat the growing dissemination of disinformation. However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.   Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.

**Result:** Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs, particularly with Mistral and Flan-T5, shows superior performance compared to traditional encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, and strong results on FewRel, achieving second place in metrics for both datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight key factors in knowledge transfer and model architecture, advancing the application of LLMs and memory replay techniques in continual relation extraction.

**Abstract:** Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

**Keywords:** Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Beam Search, Mathematical Reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper connects supervised fine-tuning with offline reinforcement learning for large language models, proposing an optimization method to mitigate inference errors in beam search.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the connection between supervised fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of large language models and their inference processes.

**Method:** The paper introduces Supervised Optimism Correction (SOC), an auxiliary loss for improving token-level Q-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning, addressing the over-optimism in beam search methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Establishes a theoretical link between supervised fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning
	2. Proposes Supervised Optimism Correction (SOC) as a solution to mitigate over-optimism in inference
	3. Demonstrates superiority of SOC through extensive experiments on benchmark tasks

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that SOC significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to traditional beam search methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating SOC leads to better model confidence and performance in inference tasks, particularly for large language models focused on mathematical reasoning.

**Abstract:** In this work, we establish a novel theoretical connection between supervised fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning under the token-level Markov decision process, revealing that large language models indeed learn an implicit $Q$-function for inference. Through this theoretical lens, we demonstrate that the widely used beam search method suffers from unacceptable over-optimism, where inference errors are inevitably amplified due to inflated $Q$-value estimations of suboptimal steps. To address this limitation, we propose Supervised Optimism Correction(SOC), which introduces a simple yet effective auxiliary loss for token-level $Q$-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, the auxiliary loss employs implicit value regularization to boost model confidence in expert-demonstrated responses, thereby suppressing over-optimism toward insufficiently supervised responses. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH, and GAOKAO, showcase the superiority of the proposed SOC with beam search across a series of open-source models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that sparsity-aware fine-tuning can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs without compromising alignment with target models.

**Abstract:** Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for reducing the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a fault-tolerant framework that enables the use of highly compressed draft models. In this work, we introduce Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters (SD$^2$), a novel methodology that leverages self-data distillation and fine-grained weight sparsity to produce highly efficient and well-aligned draft models. SD$^2$ systematically enhances draft token acceptance rates while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs), even in the Universal Assisted Generation (UAG) setting, where draft and target models originate from different model families. On a Llama-3.1-70B target model, SD$^2$ provides a 1.59$\times$ higher Mean Accepted Length (MAL) compared to layer-pruned draft models and reduces MACs by over 43.87% with a 8.36% reduction in MAL compared to a dense draft models. Our 1.5B and 3B unstructured sparse drafters outperform both dense and layer-pruned models in terms of end-to-end latency improvements; highlighting the potential of sparsity-aware fine-tuning and compression strategies to improve LLM inference efficiency while maintaining alignment with target models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limited reasoning capabilities of small language models in tasks requiring deep logical deduction.

**Method:** SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps in SLMs and provides LLM-generated guidance only when needed, framing reasoning as an optimal policy search.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SMART framework for enhancing SLM reasoning
	2. Score-based evaluation for selective LLM guidance
	3. Demonstration of improved performance on mathematical reasoning datasets

**Result:** Experiments show that targeted external scaffolding improves the performance of SLMs on complex reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The collaborative use of SLMs and LLMs can address reasoning tasks that small language models currently struggle to solve alone.

**Abstract:** The limited reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) cast doubt on their suitability for tasks demanding deep, multi-step logical deduction. This paper introduces a framework called Small Reasons, Large Hints (SMART), which selectively augments SLM reasoning with targeted guidance from large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the concept of cognitive scaffolding, SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps and injects corrective LLM-generated reasoning only when necessary. By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that targeted external scaffolding significantly improves performance, paving the way for collaborative use of both SLM and LLM to tackle complex reasoning tasks that are currently unsolvable by SLMs alone.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the problem of lazy thinking in peer reviews that compromises quality, by providing a dataset to develop detection tools.

**Method:** The study introduces the LazyReview dataset with annotated peer-review sentences and evaluates performance of LLMs in detecting lazy thinking before and after fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LazyReview dataset for peer review analysis
	2. Demonstration of the effectiveness of LLMs after fine-tuning on this dataset
	3. Guidelines for training junior reviewers based on findings

**Result:** LLMs demonstrate poor detection in a zero-shot setting but perform significantly better (10-20 points) after instruction-based fine-tuning on the dataset.

**Limitations:** The dataset's applicability may be limited to certain domains of peer review and may require further expansion for broader utility.

**Conclusion:** Lazy thinking feedback improves the comprehensiveness and actionability of peer reviews; the dataset will be released for community use.

**Abstract:** Peer review is a cornerstone of quality control in scientific publishing. With the increasing workload, the unintended use of `quick' heuristics, referred to as lazy thinking, has emerged as a recurring issue compromising review quality. Automated methods to detect such heuristics can help improve the peer-reviewing process. However, there is limited NLP research on this issue, and no real-world dataset exists to support the development of detection tools. This work introduces LazyReview, a dataset of peer-review sentences annotated with fine-grained lazy thinking categories. Our analysis reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to detect these instances in a zero-shot setting. However, instruction-based fine-tuning on our dataset significantly boosts performance by 10-20 performance points, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data. Furthermore, a controlled experiment demonstrates that reviews revised with lazy thinking feedback are more comprehensive and actionable than those written without such feedback. We will release our dataset and the enhanced guidelines that can be used to train junior reviewers in the community. (Code available here: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-lazy-review)

**Conclusion:** FAMA promotes openness in speech technology research by releasing all artifacts under open-source licenses, contributing to the field's progress.

**Abstract:** The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However, their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data. Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of clinical decision-making and to improve the evaluation of LLMs in high-stakes medical environments.

**Method:** The paper presents ER-Reason, a comprehensive benchmark that includes clinical data from 3,984 patients and emphasizes key workflows in the emergency room, evaluating LLMs on tasks reflecting real clinical reasoning, complemented by rationales from physicians.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ER-Reason benchmark for evaluating LLMs in clinical scenarios
	2. Inclusion of diverse clinical data types relevant to emergency room workflows
	3. Collection of physician-authored rationales to enhance understanding of clinical reasoning processes.

**Result:** State-of-the-art LLMs underperformed compared to clinician-authored rationales, indicating a significant gap in the clinical reasoning capability of LLMs in emergency decision-making contexts.

**Limitations:** The benchmark relies on historical clinical data and may not account for emerging medical practices.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the necessity for enhanced understanding of LLMs' clinical reasoning and call for future research to address identified gaps in their performance in medical contexts.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need for future research to bridge this divide.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper develops a benchmark, CHED, to evaluate the context robustness of knowledge editing methods in large language models, introducing a new method, CoRE, to enhance editing success in the presence of contextual information.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the shortcomings of current knowledge editing evaluations that ignore the impact of preceding contexts in real-world applications, which can trigger retrieval of original knowledge and undermine edits.

**Method:** The proposed CHED benchmark evaluates the context robustness of knowledge editing methods. CoRE is introduced as a new KE method that minimizes context-sensitive variance in hidden states to improve editing success when context is present.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CHED benchmark for evaluating context robustness in KE methods.
	2. Development of the CoRE method to improve knowledge editing success in the presence of contextual information.
	3. Analysis of the effects of different types of preceding contexts on editing outcomes.

**Result:** Evaluations reveal that existing KE methods often fail when preceding contexts are presented. CoRE significantly improves editing success rates while preserving model capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The ability to edit knowledge is enhanced by considering context robustness, revealing the need for methods like CoRE that accommodate real-world application scenarios.

**Abstract:** Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence editing success.

**Motivation:** To explore whether the abstract reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are viable for practical problems outside traditional domains.

**Method:** The authors developed a fully automated pipeline to generate a benchmark for historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning, adjustable for difficulty.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark for reasoning in historical linguistics inspired by Programming by Examples.
	2. Automation of benchmark generation to address scalability and contamination problems.
	3. Demonstration of LLM struggles with reasoning tasks that are common in historical linguistics.

**Result:** Nearly 1,000 test instances were generated, showing that even the best state-of-the-art LLM struggled, achieving only a 54% pass rate.

**Limitations:** The focus is primarily on reasoning related to historical linguistics, possibly limiting generalizability beyond this domain.

**Conclusion:** LLM reasoning capabilities remain limited, specifically in domains like historical linguistics that require a different type of reasoning.

**Abstract:** Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

**Result:** The introduction of ScEdit reveals that existing KE methods struggle with performance on new evaluation metrics, particularly text-level metrics, indicating challenges in the editing process.

**Limitations:** The study indicates a performance drop in KE methods on new metrics, suggesting inherent challenges in the editing tasks.

**Conclusion:** The novel benchmark aims to provide a more realistic assessment of KE methods, highlighting their limitations and areas for improvement in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) -- which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based ("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the factual accuracy of large language models, particularly in addressing hallucinations that occur during longer contexts in text generation.

**Method:** ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy that decides when to apply contrasting layers in the decoding process, treating this selection as a sequential decision-making problem.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel decoding strategy called Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD).
	2. Implements a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the token selection process.
	3. Demonstrates superior performance in factuality over existing methods across multiple benchmarks.

**Result:** ActLCD outperforms existing state-of-the-art decoding methods across five different benchmarks, effectively reducing hallucinations.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address potential computational overhead introduced by the reinforcement learning policy used in ActLCD.

**Conclusion:** The proposed ActLCD strategy significantly enhances the factuality of LLMs during generation, showing promise for wider applications in text generation tasks.

**Abstract:** Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges in aligning large language models with humans, considering the multifaceted nature of human decision-making based on satisficing strategies.

**Method:** SITAlign proposes an inference time framework that maximizes a primary objective while ensuring that secondary criteria meet acceptable thresholds, with theoretical and empirical validations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SITAlign framework for satisficing alignment
	2. Theoretical derivation of sub-optimality bounds
	3. Empirical validation showing significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods

**Result:** SITAlign improves performance on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, surpassing the existing multi-objective decoding strategies by 22.3% in helpfulness reward while maintaining harmlessness criteria.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework offers a novel way to operationalize human-like decision making in model alignment, demonstrating both theoretical insights and superior empirical performance.

**Abstract:** Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.
