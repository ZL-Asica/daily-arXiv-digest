  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to understand the institutional motivations and practices of organizations that maintain public knowledge and cultural heritage, particularly how they use Wikidata.

**Method:** Interviews were conducted with 15 participants from memory institutions to identify user roles and contributions to Wikidata.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of user roles within memory institutions using Wikidata
	2. Exploration of collaboration opportunities between institutions and volunteers
	3. Highlighting the data work significance in Wikidata contributed by memory institutions.

**Result:** Three archetypal user roles (providers, acquirers, and mutualists) were identified along with the types of contributions made by memory institutions, highlighting collaboration opportunities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the significant data work of memory institutions on Wikidata and suggests ways to enhance collaboration between institutional users and volunteers.

**Abstract:** Wikidata, an open structured database and a sibling project to Wikipedia, has recently become an important platform for information professionals to share structured metadata from their memory institutions, organizations that maintain public knowledge and cultural heritage materials. While studies have investigated why and how peer producers contribute to Wikidata, the institutional motivations and practices of these organizations are less understood. Given Wikidata's potential role in linking and supporting knowledge infrastructures and open data systems, we examined why and how information professionals in memory institutions use Wikidata as part of their organizational workflow. Through interviews with 15 participants, we identified the three archetypal roles of Wikidata users within memory institutions, providers, acquirers, and mutualists, and the different types of contributions that these institutions bring to Wikidata. We then explored potential collaboration opportunities between memory institutions and other volunteers in Wikidata, discussed the value of the data work conducted by these professionals, and examined how and why they track their contributions. Our work contributes to the wider discussions around collaboration and data work in CSCW by (1) studying the motivations and practices of information professionals, their differences from those doing volunteer work, and opportunities for the Wikidata community to promote more collaborative efforts within memory institutions and with other volunteers and (2) drawing attention to the important data work done by memory institutions on Wikidata and pointing out opportunities to support the contributions of information professionals.

*Dennis Brown, Samuel Mulder*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** virtual reality, binary reverse engineering, large language models, cognitive design, visualization

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the integration of a large language model (LLM) agent into a virtual reality (VR) environment for binary reverse engineering (RE), enhancing the cognitive processes involved.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To reduce cognitive complexity in binary reverse engineering (RE) and improve the analysis process through immersive VR and LLM integration.

**Method:** The authors extended a previously implemented VR platform by incorporating an LLM capable of interacting with binary analysis tools and generating 3D visualizations for RE tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of an LLM agent into a VR environment for RE
	2. Demonstration of LLM-generated 3D visualizations
	3. Evaluation of the system's effectiveness in enhancing RE processes

**Result:** Pilot studies indicated that while LLMs could create meaningful 3D call graphs, the quality of the outputs varied significantly.

**Limitations:** Output quality of visualizations varies widely; potential concerns regarding LLM capabilities as visualization agents without explicit training.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest potential for LLMs as visualization agents in cognitive design while also highlighting variability in output quality.

**Abstract:** Immersive virtual reality (VR) offers affordances that may reduce cognitive complexity in binary reverse engineering (RE), enabling embodied and external cognition to augment the RE process through enhancing memory, hypothesis testing, and visual organization. In prior work, we applied a cognitive systems engineering approach to identify an initial set of affordances and implemented a VR environment to support RE through spatial persistence and interactivity. In this work, we extend that platform with an integrated large language model (LLM) agent capable of querying binary analysis tools, answering technical questions, and dynamically generating immersive 3D visualizations in alignment with analyst tasks. We describe the system architecture and our evaluation process and results. Our pilot study shows that while LLMs can generate meaningful 3D call graphs (for small programs) that align with design principles, output quality varies widely. This work raises open questions about the potential for LLMs to function as visualization agents, constructing 3D representations that reflect cognitive design principles without explicit training.

### [3] [Visuo-Tactile Feedback with Hand Outline Styles for Modulating Affective Roughness Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13504)

*Minju Baeck, Yoonseok Shin, Dooyoung Kim, Hyunjin Lee, Sang Ho Yoon, Woontack Woo*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** visuo-tactile feedback, affective perception, virtual reality, haptic feedback, emotional modulation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method for enhancing affective roughness perception in VR using visuo-tactile feedback, combining virtual hand visualization with fingertip vibrations to modulate emotional responses.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the underexplored role of visual feedback on virtual hands and its effect on haptic experience in virtual reality.

**Method:** A visuo-tactile feedback approach was developed, incorporating affective visual cues like line shape, motion, and color applied to hand outlines while examining their impact on affective responses and perceived roughness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces visuo-tactile feedback method for VR
	2. Demonstrates the impact of visual cues on haptic feedback experience
	3. Provides insights on how different shapes and colors influence emotional responses

**Result:** Sharp contours increased perceived roughness, heightened arousal, and reduced valence, while color influenced valence only, especially impacting emotional perception at lower haptic intensities.

**Limitations:** Further research needed to explore long-term effects and user variability in real-world settings.

**Conclusion:** Integrating visual cues with tactile feedback enriches affective rendering in immersive VR, allowing for nuanced emotional adjustments in user interactions.

**Abstract:** We propose a visuo-tactile feedback method that combines virtual hand visualization and fingertip vibrations to modulate affective roughness perception in VR. While prior work has focused on object-based textures and vibrotactile feedback, the role of visual feedback on virtual hands remains underexplored. Our approach introduces affective visual cues including line shape, motion, and color applied to hand outlines, and examines their influence on both affective responses (arousal, valence) and perceived roughness. Results show that sharp contours enhanced perceived roughness, increased arousal, and reduced valence, intensifying the emotional impact of haptic feedback. In contrast, color affected valence only, with red consistently lowering emotional positivity. These effects were especially noticeable at lower haptic intensities, where visual cues extended affective modulation into mid-level perceptual ranges. Overall, the findings highlight how integrating expressive visual cues with tactile feedback can enrich affective rendering and offer flexible emotional tuning in immersive VR interactions.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** large language models, student writing feedback, process data, keylogs, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the impact of integrating writing process data, such as keylogs and time-stamped snapshots, on the quality of feedback generated by large language models for student essays.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine if LLMs can provide feedback that is cognizant of the writing process, not just the final product.

**Method:** An ablation study comparing feedback from LLMs using only the final essay (C1) versus feedback that includes both the final essay and the writing process data (C2).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrating that keylogs and time-stamped snapshots can enhance LLM feedback quality.
	2. Providing empirical evidence through an ablation study comparing different feedback conditions.
	3. Highlighting the distinctions between final product assessment and process-sensitive evaluation.

**Result:** Feedback from C2 showed significantly improved structural evaluation and process-sensitive justification compared to C1, despite minimal changes in rubric scores overall.

**Limitations:** Rubric scores did not show significant changes, suggesting more research is needed to determine the full implications of process data on feedback quality.

**Conclusion:** Incorporating writing process data into LLM-generated feedback enhances its quality, indicating the importance of understanding the writing process.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) increasingly assist in evaluating student writing, researchers have begun questioning whether these models can be cognitively grounded, that is, whether they can attend not just to the final product, but to the process by which it was written. In this study, we explore how incorporating writing process data, specifically keylogs and time-stamped snapshots, affects the quality of LLM-generated feedback. We conduct an ablation study on 52 student essays comparing feedback generated with access to only the final essay (C1) and feedback that also incorporates keylogs and time-stamped snapshots (C2). While rubric scores changed minimally, C2 feedback demonstrated significantly improved structural evaluation and greater process-sensitive justification.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the complexities of emotional attachment in human-AI relationships and calls for addressing ethical concerns in AI communications.

**Abstract:** Human-AI romantic relationships have gained wide popularity among social media users in China. The technological impact on romantic relationships and its potential applications have long drawn research attention to topics such as relationship preservation and negativity mitigation. Media and communication studies also explore the practices in romantic para-social relationships. Nonetheless, this emerging human-AI romantic relationship, whether the relations fall into the category of para-social relationship together with its navigation pattern, remains unexplored, particularly in the context of relational stages and emotional attachment. This research thus seeks to fill this gap by presenting a mixed-method approach on 1,766 posts and 60,925 comments from Xiaohongshu, as well as the semi-structured interviews with 23 participants, of whom one of them developed her relationship with self-created AI for three years. The findings revealed that the users' willingness to self-disclose to AI companions led to increased positivity without social stigma. The results also unveiled the reciprocal nature of these interactions, the dominance of 'self', and raised concerns about language misuse, bias, and data security in AI communication.

### [7] [Bend It, Aim It, Tap It: Designing an On-Body Disambiguation Mechanism for Curve Selection in Mixed Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13748)

*Xiang Li, Per Ola Kristensson*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Mixed Reality, Object Selection, User Interaction, Bezier Curve, On-body Disambiguation

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents two techniques for improving object selection in Mixed Reality environments: a Bezier Curve selection tool and an on-body disambiguation method, showing their effectiveness in reducing errors and enhancing user experience.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Object selection in dense or occluded Mixed Reality environments is challenging due to the limitations of traditional ray-casting methods, leading to the need for improved selection techniques.

**Method:** The study evaluates a Bezier Curve selection method that uses finger curvature for one-handed input alongside an on-body disambiguation technique, which utilizes proximity-based mapping to project selection candidates onto the user's forearm.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a real-time Bezier Curve selection method for improved user interaction.
	2. Development of an on-body disambiguation mechanism for enhanced selection accuracy.
	3. Demonstrated empirical benefits of these methods through a controlled user study.

**Result:** The findings indicate that the on-body disambiguation significantly decreased selection errors and physical demand, while enhancing user-perceived performance and overall satisfaction. Bezier Curve input facilitated access to occluded objects but led to increased task completion times and effort in certain cases.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by its small sample size and specific environmental conditions during evaluation.

**Conclusion:** The integration of curved input techniques and tactile feedback from on-body previews offers promising design strategies for enhancing precise selection in immersive Mixed Reality contexts.

**Abstract:** Object selection in Mixed Reality (MR) becomes particularly challenging in dense or occluded environments, where traditional mid-air ray-casting often leads to ambiguity and reduced precision. We present two complementary techniques: (1) a real-time Bezier Curve selection paradigm guided by finger curvature, enabling expressive one-handed trajectories, and (2) an on-body disambiguation mechanism that projects the four nearest candidates onto the user's forearm via proximity-based mapping. Together, these techniques combine flexible, user-controlled selection with tactile, proprioceptive disambiguation. We evaluated their independent and joint effects in a 2x2 within-subjects study (N = 24), crossing interaction paradigm (Bezier Curve vs. Linear Ray) with interaction medium (Mid-air vs. On-body). Results show that on-body disambiguation significantly reduced selection errors and physical demand while improving perceived performance, hedonic quality, and user preference. Bezier input provided effective access to occluded targets but incurred longer task times and greater effort under some conditions. We conclude with design implications for integrating curved input and on-body previews to support precise, adaptive selection in immersive environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Bridging cognitive and physical models can lead to enhanced understanding of user behavior and improved interface design.

**Abstract:** Computational models of how users perceive and act within a virtual or physical environment offer enormous potential for the understanding and design of user interactions. Cognition models have been used to understand the role of attention and individual preferences and beliefs on human decision making during interaction, while biomechanical simulations have been successfully applied to analyse and predict physical effort, fatigue, and discomfort. The next frontier in HCI lies in connecting these models to enable robust, diverse, and representative simulations of different user groups. These embodied user simulations could predict user intents, strategies, and movements during interaction more accurately, benchmark interfaces and interaction techniques in terms of performance and ergonomics, and guide adaptive system design. This UIST workshop explores ideas for integrating computational models into HCI and discusses use cases such as UI/UX design, automated system testing, and personalised adaptive interfaces. It brings researchers from relevant disciplines together to identify key opportunities and challenges as well as feasible next steps for bridging mind and motion to simulate interactive user behaviour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for resource-efficient training tools in medical education, particularly for Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) that typically rely on extensive resources.

**Method:** The framework enhances text-based simulations by equipping LLM-based patients with action spaces allowing for richer non-textual interactions and incorporates virtual tutors for real-time feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a framework for dynamic patient behaviors in LLM simulations
	2. Integration of virtual tutors for personalized feedback
	3. Evaluation of system performance with expert assessments

**Result:** The system's performance was rigorously evaluated, showing effective real-time interaction and feedback capabilities, leading to positive assessments from medical experts regarding the naturalness of interactions.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the scope and size of evaluations conducted with end-users.

**Conclusion:** This system provides medical students with an innovative, low-cost, and accessible tool for preparing for OSCEs, enabling personalized learning experiences.

**Abstract:** Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are essential for medical training, but they require significant resources, including professional actors and expert medical feedback. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced text-based virtual patients for communication practice, these simulations often lack the capability for richer, non-textual interactions. This paper presents a novel framework that significantly enhances LLM-based simulated patients by equipping them with action spaces, thereby enabling more realistic and dynamic patient behaviors that extend beyond text. Furthermore, our system incorporates virtual tutors that provide students with instant, personalized feedback on their performance at any time during these simulated encounters. We have conducted a rigorous evaluation of the framework's real-time performance, including system latency and component accuracy. Preliminary evaluations with medical experts assessed the naturalness and coherence of the simulated patients, as well as the usefulness and appropriateness of the virtual tutor's assessments. This innovative system provides medical students with a low-cost, accessible platform for personalized OSCE preparation at home.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity, and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples), specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit (IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The integration of AI into daily life necessitates equipping students with effective and ethical AI interaction skills, as identified by K-12 educators.

**Method:** The study involved creating an LLM-based educational module with scenario-based practices and deploying it across 11 secondary school classrooms to assess its impact.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an LLM-based prompting literacy module
	2. Effective use of AI auto-grader in educational settings

**Conclusion:** The study suggests the potential for broader deployment of AI in education and emphasizes the need for further research on learning effectiveness.

**Abstract:** As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly. Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.

### [12] [Script-Strategy Aligned Generation: Aligning LLMs with Expert-Crafted Dialogue Scripts and Therapeutic Strategies for Psychotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06723)

*Xin Sun, Jan de Wit, Zhuying Li, Jiahuan Pei, Abdallah El Ali, Jos A. Bosch*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** chatbots, large language models, psychotherapy, Script-Strategy Aligned Generation, expert-crafted dialogue

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores enhancing psychotherapeutic chatbot performance by aligning large language models (LLMs) with expert-crafted dialogue scripts, resulting in improved empathy and dialogue relevance while reducing reliance on complete scripting.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the controllability and explainability of chatbots in psychotherapy, shifting away from rigid, rule-based systems towards more flexible systems utilizing LLMs.

**Method:** Conducted two studies: Study 1 compared rule-based, pure LLM, and aligned LLMs using online experiments; Study 2 implemented the proposed Script-Strategy Aligned Generation (SSAG) approach in a field study to assess therapeutic effectiveness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Script-Strategy Aligned Generation (SSAG) approach
	2. Empirical validation of aligned LLMs outperforming rule-based systems
	3. Demonstration of reduced expert content reliance in effective chatbot implementations

**Result:** Aligned LLMs outperformed rule-based and pure LLM systems in empathy and relevance; SSAG maintained therapeutic effectiveness with less than 40% of expert-crafted content compared to full-scripted LLMs.

**Limitations:** The study size for field testing was limited, and further research is needed to generalize the findings across diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** SSAG provides a scalable and efficient solution for implementing LLMs in psychotherapy, allowing domain experts to guide the models effectively without needing complete scripts.

**Abstract:** Chatbots or conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used to improve access to digital psychotherapy. Many current systems rely on rigid, rule-based designs, heavily dependent on expert-crafted dialogue scripts for guiding therapeutic conversations. Although advances in large language models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible interactions, their lack of controllability and explanability poses challenges in high-stakes contexts like psychotherapy. To address this, we conducted two studies in this work to explore how aligning LLMs with expert-crafted scripts can enhance psychotherapeutic chatbot performance. In Study 1 (N=43), an online experiment with a within-subjects design, we compared rule-based, pure LLM, and LLMs aligned with expert-crafted scripts via fine-tuning and prompting. Results showed that aligned LLMs significantly outperformed the other types of chatbots in empathy, dialogue relevance, and adherence to therapeutic principles. Building on findings, we proposed ``Script-Strategy Aligned Generation (SSAG)'', a more flexible alignment approach that reduces reliance on fully scripted content while maintaining LLMs' therapeutic adherence and controllability. In a 10-day field Study 2 (N=21), SSAG achieved comparable therapeutic effectiveness to full-scripted LLMs while requiring less than 40\% of expert-crafted dialogue content. Beyond these results, this work advances LLM applications in psychotherapy by providing a controllable and scalable solution, reducing reliance on expert effort. By enabling domain experts to align LLMs through high-level strategies rather than full scripts, SSAG supports more efficient co-development and expands access to a broader context of psychotherapy.

**Motivation:** Understanding how different types of LLM-generated explanations influence user engagement and trust in recommendation systems.

**Method:** A pre-registered online experiment with 759 participants compared generic and contextualized LLM-generated explanations, followed by qualitative interviews with 30 users.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the impact of LLM-generated explanations on user engagement.
	2. Clarifies the role of context in enhancing trust and understanding in recommendations.
	3. Provides insights for designing future recommender systems in online platforms.

**Result:** Contextualized explanations improved cognitive needs and intentions to watch recommended movies, while generic explanations provided limited benefits.

**Limitations:** The research focuses on a specific context of movie recommendations; results may not generalize to other domains.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of designing user-centric LLM-generated explanations, noting potential issues with excessive personalization.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in recommender systems, where LLMs can be used to generate personalized recommendations. Here, we examine how different LLM-generated explanations for movie recommendations affect users' perceptions of cognitive, affective, and utilitarian needs and consumption intentions. In a pre-registered, between-subject online experiment (N=759) and follow-up interviews (N=30), we compare (a) LLM-generated generic explanations, and (b) LLM-generated contextualized explanations. Our findings show that contextualized explanations (i.e., explanations that incorporate users' past behaviors) effectively meet users' cognitive needs while increasing users' intentions to watch recommended movies. However, adding explanations offers limited benefits in meeting users' utilitarian and affective needs, raising concerns about the proper design and implications of LLM-generated explanations. Qualitative insights from interviews reveal that referencing users' past preferences enhances trust and understanding but can feel excessive if overused. Furthermore, users with more active and positive engagement with the recommender system and movie-watching get substantial gains from contextualized explanations. Overall, our research clarifies how LLM-generated recommendations influence users' motivations and behaviors, providing valuable insights for the future development of user-centric recommender systems, a key element in social media platforms and online ecosystems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** POML contributes a comprehensive solution for prompt orchestration that can be integrated into various LLM applications, improving developer experience and output accuracy.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity, and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples), specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit (IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

**Motivation:** To address structural gender imbalances in large language model outputs stemming from training data.

**Method:** An extended actor-level pipeline for discourse-aware fairness analysis that includes new metrics for sentiment, syntactic agency, and quotation styles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of actor-level metrics for gender discrimination detection
	2. Development of a pipeline for diagnostic analysis and corpus balancing

**Conclusion:** Surface-level asymmetries can be mitigated, but deeper biases in sentiment and framing still exist; tools and reports are available for further research.

**Abstract:** Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora. Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency, and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from 1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing and equitable corpus construction.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of MM-BrowseComp, a benchmark for assessing multimodal retrieval and reasoning in AI agents.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of evaluation in multimodal content for AI web browsing agents, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on textual information.

**Method:** The benchmark includes 224 hand-crafted questions designed to test agents' multimodal retrieval capabilities and reasoning, involving images and videos.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MM-BrowseComp for multimodal evaluation
	2. Comprehensive set of multimodal questions for benchmark
	3. Checklist for analyzing multimodal dependencies

**Result:** Evaluation of state-of-the-art models revealed a maximum accuracy of only 29.02%, indicating limited multimodal capability and reasoning in current top models.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on web browsing scenarios; may not cover all aspects of multimodal reasoning.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for improved multimodal reasoning in AI agents for better performance in complex browsing tasks.

**Abstract:** AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising 224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents' multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\% accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current models.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Integrating ASR and MT for real-time, on-device streaming translation poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing translation quality and latency.

**Method:** The authors propose a simultaneous translation approach that leverages linguistic cues from ASR and employs efficient beam-search pruning techniques like time-out and forced finalization for real-time performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a simultaneous translation approach to balance quality and latency.
	2. Investigated efficient integration strategies of ASR and MT using linguistic cues.
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements in on-device bilingual speech translation.

**Result:** The proposed method demonstrates improved latency and quality in bilingual conversational speech translation compared to baseline systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The techniques developed not only enhance real-time translation performance but also close the quality gap with non-streaming systems, enabling more effective real-time speech translation.

**Abstract:** This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency. We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the impact of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) on idiomaticity detection, revealing varied improvements based on model size.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how reasoning models can enhance the detection of idiomatic expressions in language tasks.

**Method:** Evaluated the performance of DeepSeek-R1 distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four idiomaticity detection datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Explores the relationship between reasoning capabilities in LLMs and idiomaticity detection performance.
	2. Analyses the effects of model size on logical reasoning and idiomaticity understanding.
	3. Demonstrates the impact of prompt engineering on smaller models for improved performance.

**Result:** Larger models exhibit good understanding of idiomaticity, while smaller models show limited performance; chain-of-thought reasoning improves smaller models’ performance but not to base models’ level.

**Limitations:** The variability in performance improvements across different model sizes and datasets needs further exploration.

**Conclusion:** Providing definitions in prompts for smaller models can improve their idiomaticity detection performance in specific scenarios.

**Abstract:** The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning. In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1 distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B) show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some cases.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenges faced by ASR systems in maintaining accuracy for long audio transcripts, which affects tasks like Named Entity Recognition and punctuation.

**Method:** The proposed approach uses token-level distillation with optimal transport and representation loss minimization between the Whisper and LLaMA models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced novel NER metrics to assess ASR improvements
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of distilling knowledge from LLaMA to Whisper
	3. Provided a foundation for semantics-aware ASR systems in longform speech

**Result:** Significant improvements were observed in Word Error Rate, Named Entity Recognition, capitalization, and punctuation on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating linguistic context into ASR systems is crucial for improving the transcription accuracy of longform speech, paving the way for more robust solutions.

**Abstract:** ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** language model, data analysis, analytical reasoning, machine learning, synthetic data

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Datarus-R1-14B is a 14 billion-parameter language model designed as a virtual data analyst, fine-tuned to effectively reason and provide analytical solutions across various domains.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind Datarus is to create an advanced language model that not only answers questions but also engages in full analytical reasoning, capable of tackling complex postgraduate-level problems.

**Method:** The model is fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset comprising 144,000 notebook episodes using a dual-reward framework and features a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which enhances reasoning processes through curriculum learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a trajectory-centric training data generator for comprehensive analytical reasoning.
	2. Developed a dual-reward framework for enhancing end-to-end problem-solving coherence.
	3. Achieved superior performance on analytical benchmarks with reduced output verbosity.

**Result:** Datarus outperforms similarly sized models and matches the performance of larger reasoning models, showing up to 30% higher accuracy on benchmarks while generating significantly fewer tokens for solutions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dual reasoning interface and structured training allow Datarus to effectively solve complex analytical tasks while minimizing verbosity and improving coherence in outputs.

**Abstract:** We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions, all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine, numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000 tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding. A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment" pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems. Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes using parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' word-association norms to enhance cultural alignment in LLMs, showing significant improvements in language model performance with limited retraining.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the distributional bias in LLMs that affects cross-cultural communication and enhance cultural alignment.

**Method:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning on English-US and Mandarin free word-association norms using supervised fine-tuning and PPO-based optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a cost-efficient method for fine-tuning LLMs based on cultural word associations.
	2. Demonstrated significant improvements in association precision and cultural alignment.
	3. Showed that fine-tuned models can rival much larger models in effectiveness.

**Result:** Fine-tuning improves association precision by up to 165% in Mandarin, aligns model responses with cultural values, and rivals larger models in performance.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on English and Mandarin and may not generalize to other languages or cultures.

**Conclusion:** Culturally grounded fine-tuning can significantly enhance the cultural alignment of AI models without extensive retraining, paving the way for future research in human cognition.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy: parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by 16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20, and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our 7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI models.

**TL;DR:** ProMed is a proactive reinforcement learning framework for medical LLMs that enhances interactive medical questioning by enabling the generation of clinically valuable questions before making decisions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of current medical LLMs that operate reactively and may risk incorrect diagnoses due to lack of interactive questioning.

**Method:** ProMed employs a reinforcement learning framework with a Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward system, integrating SIG into a two-stage training pipeline consisting of SIG-Guided Model Initialization and SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proactive questioning capability for medical LLMs
	2. Introduction of Shapley Information Gain (SIG) as a reward mechanism
	3. Two-stage training pipeline for reinforcement learning enhancement

**Result:** ProMed outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and provides a 54.45% performance improvement over reactive models, while showing good generalization to out-of-domain cases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ProMed effectively enhances the proactive capabilities of medical LLMs in clinical settings, improving their ability to gather essential patient information before decision-making.

**Abstract:** Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.

**Keywords:** Saudi dialects, large language models, LoRA tuning, dialect generation, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method for enhancing large language models to support Saudi dialects, focusing on Najdi and Hijazi, through LoRA-tuning a foundation model using a curated dataset.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underrepresentation of Saudi dialects in large language models, which hinders the ability to capture authentic dialectal variations.

**Method:** The study utilizes a Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset with 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs, employing LoRA-tuning on the ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview model. Two training variants are tested: Dialect-Token training and No-Token training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first foundation model developed in Saudi Arabia for dialect generation.
	2. Empirical evaluation demonstrating significant improvements in dialect accuracy and fidelity over existing models.
	3. Provision of training, evaluation, and inference code for independent research verification.

**Result:** The Dialect-Token model significantly improved Saudi dialect control and fidelity, achieving a Saudi rate of 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage to 6.21%. Both LoRA variants outperformed existing strong models in dialect control and fidelity metrics.

**Limitations:** The dataset and model weights/adapters are not publicly released, potentially limiting wider application and assessment.

**Conclusion:** The authors highlight the importance of tailored dialectal training for enhanced model performance while acknowledging the non-release of the dataset or model weights to maintain controlled access.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50 split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from 47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead, we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

**Motivation:** To assess the capabilities of LLMs in the Telugu language and understand their limitations through a fine-grained evaluation dataset.

**Method:** Evaluation of 11 LLMs using the MATA dataset, comprising both multiple-choice and open-ended questions, with comparative analyses against human evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MATA dataset for Telugu LLM evaluation
	2. Empirical analysis of LLM performance on diverse linguistic tasks
	3. Comparison of LLM and human evaluations for open-ended questions

**Result:** LLMs showed reliance on superficial heuristics in answering multiple-choice questions; there are significant insights into model performance and evaluation reliability in a low-resource language context.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Fine-grained evaluations are critical for improving LLMs and can influence future research directions in Telugu NLP.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729 carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future research in Telugu NLP.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the trust-equivalence of compressed deep learning models compared to their larger counterparts, focusing on interpretability and calibration similarity despite similar accuracy levels.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess whether compressed models can be trusted like their original larger versions, beyond just their performance metrics.

**Method:** The authors propose a two-dimensional framework focusing on interpretability alignment and calibration similarity, using LIME, SHAP, ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability diagrams for assessment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a framework for evaluating trust-equivalence of models.
	2. Identified low interpretability alignment and calibration similarity in compressed models.
	3. Emphasized the necessity of careful assessment when deploying compressed models.

**Result:** Experiments with BERT-base and its compressed variants indicate low interpretability alignment and significant calibration similarity gaps, even when accuracy is comparable.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to specific tasks and models (text classification with BERT-base).

**Conclusion:** Compressed models should not be deployed as direct replacements for large models without thorough evaluation of trust-equivalence, as they may not be reliable despite similar performance.

**Abstract:** Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks: natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan, Alireza Nik, Vajira Thambawita, Bogdan Ionescu, Michael Riegler*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, decoding strategies, healthcare, evaluation metrics, text generation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the impact of decoding strategies on the quality of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the underexplored area of how different decoding strategies affect the accuracy of LLM-generated text in critical healthcare tasks.

**Method:** The authors evaluate 11 decoding strategies across five medical tasks—translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image captioning—using both medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of varying sizes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of 11 decoding strategies in medical applications
	2. Analysis of the trade-offs between decoding methods and model size
	3. Comparison of multiple evaluation metrics for task performance

**Result:** Deterministic decoding strategies generally yield better results than stochastic ones, with beam search performing the best and top-k sampling performing the worst. Larger models scored better overall but had longer inference times and sensitivity to decoding strategies.

**Limitations:** The study's scope is limited to five medical tasks and a specific set of LLMs, which may not represent all possible scenarios in healthcare applications.

**Conclusion:** The paper underscores the importance of carefully selecting decoding methods in medical LLM applications, as their influence can surpass that of model choice.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare, where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks, including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding. Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice.

**TL;DR:** A Bayesian evaluation compares moral understanding between language models and humans.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how well large language models grasp moral dimensions compared to human annotators.

**Method:** A Bayesian framework capturing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties was applied in evaluating language models across a large dataset of annotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First large-scale Bayesian evaluation of language models in moral understanding
	2. Incorporation of annotator disagreement to capture uncertainty
	3. Demonstration of AI models' superior performance in moral detection compared to humans.

**Result:** AI models ranked among the top 25% of human annotators and showed better-than-average balanced accuracy, with fewer false negatives than humans in moral detection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Language models generally exhibit stronger capabilities in moral detection than human annotators, especially in reducing false negatives.

**Abstract:** How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?   This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth (majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty (model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on 100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.   Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more sensitive moral detection capabilities.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates gender bias in Speech-LLMs using speaker assignment as an analytic tool, focusing on the TTS model Bark.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether Speech-LLMs exhibit gender bias similar to text-based LLMs, leveraging speaker selection as an explicit cue for bias analysis.

**Method:** The study evaluates the TTS model Bark by analyzing its default speaker assignments for prompts from two datasets: one with gender-stereotyped occupations and another with gendered connotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a new methodology for bias investigation in Speech-LLMs using speaker assignment.
	2. Constructs two datasets for evaluating gender bias in TTS outputs.
	3. Finds that Bark shows gender awareness despite not exhibiting systematic bias.

**Result:** Bark does not show systematic bias but does exhibit some awareness and inclinations related to gender.

**Limitations:** Focuses only on the Bark TTS model; findings may not generalize to other Speech-LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that while Bark's speaker selection is not biased, its outputs indicate gender awareness influenced by training data.

**Abstract:** Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii) Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.

**TL;DR:** CRISP is a novel method for persistent concept unlearning in LLMs using sparse autoencoders, effectively removing unwanted knowledge while maintaining model utility.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a critical need to remove harmful knowledge from large language models without sacrificing their overall performance, especially in safety-critical applications.

**Method:** CRISP employs sparse autoencoders to identify and suppress activations of salient features across multiple layers in LLMs, allowing for persistent changes in model parameters instead of temporary adjustments at inference time.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CRISP for parameter-efficient concept unlearning
	2. Demonstration of improved performance on safety-critical tasks
	3. Feature-level analysis shows semantic coherence in concept suppression.

**Result:** Experiments with two LLMs demonstrate that CRISP outperforms existing methods on the WMDP benchmark for unlearning tasks, successfully ridding the models of harmful knowledge while preserving essential capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CRISP allows for effective and persistent unlearning in large language models, achieving coherent separation between harmful and benign concepts.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features. However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates vision language models (VLMs) on Vietnamese educational assessments and introduces the ViExam benchmark with 2,548 multimodal questions, revealing performance issues and potential for improvement through human collaboration.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the capabilities of VLMs on low-resource languages and their performance on multimodal educational content in Vietnamese, which has been largely unexplored.

**Method:** The study conducts a comprehensive evaluation using the ViExam benchmark, which includes 2,548 multimodal questions across various academic domains, testing how VLMs trained predominantly on English data perform on these assessments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ViExam benchmark for Vietnamese educational assessments
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of VLM performance on multimodal questions in low-resource language
	3. Demonstration of the effects of cross-lingual prompting and human-in-the-loop strategies on performance.

**Result:** State-of-the-art VLMs achieved only 57.74% mean accuracy, with open-source models at 27.70%, underperforming compared to average human test-takers (66.54%). The best VLM, o3, scored 74.07%, yet this was still below the best human performance (99.60). Cross-lingual prompting decreased accuracy by 1 percentage point.

**Limitations:** Limited to performance evaluation on a specific set of Vietnamese educational assessments and may not generalize to all low-resource languages or educational contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight significant gaps in VLM performance on cross-lingual multimodal reasoning for educational content in Vietnamese, indicating a need for improved methodologies or collaboration with humans to enhance results.

**Abstract:** Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments, investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3 (74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance, decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with respect to non-monotonic logic and defeasible reasoning patterns, which are crucial in various cognitive and linguistic domains.

**Method:** Evaluated 28 LLMs against 20 defeasible reasoning patterns using different prompting styles (zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on defeasible reasoning
	2. Identification of prompting strategies that affect reasoning performance
	3. Insights into the limitations of LLMs regarding generics and non-monotonic logic

**Result:** While some models performed well on default reasoning tasks, there was significant variability in performance, with few-shot prompting showing modest improvements and chain-of-thought prompting often degrading performance.

**Limitations:** The evaluation may not cover all context types and reasoning patterns, and performance varies significantly across models and prompts.

**Conclusion:** Current LLMs exhibit both strengths in handling default reasoning and notable weaknesses, particularly in distinguishing between defeasible and deductive inference.

**Abstract:** This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations (e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic. Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition. We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation (mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits of current LLMs for default reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the interpretability of AI systems by understanding the knowledge encoded in deep learning models, particularly in word embeddings used in large language models.

**Method:** The paper examines existing methods for predicting human-interpretable semantic features from word embeddings and analyzes their limitations in genuinely reflecting semantic understanding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of the assumption that prediction accuracy implies feature-based interpretability in word embeddings.
	2. Demonstration that existing methods may yield accurate predictions without corresponding semantic knowledge.
	3. Highlighting the distinction between geometric similarity and genuine semantic representation.

**Result:** The authors demonstrate that prediction accuracy can be misleading, showing that good performance can be achieved even with random information, thus questioning the validity of existing interpretability assumptions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mappings of embeddings to semantic features reflect geometric similarities rather than genuine semantic properties; therefore, prediction performance alone is not a reliable indicator of meaningful interpretability.

**Abstract:** Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features, known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based interpretability.   We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information, concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

**Abstract:** With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge, individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its strong potential for real-world clinical decision support.

**Read time:** 7 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Sycophancy in large language models can distort factual outputs, especially in high-stakes domains like scientific QA, where accuracy is crucial.

**Method:** The study introduces a unified evaluation framework to assess sycophantic tendencies in models and proposes Pressure-Tune, a post-training method that fine-tunes models on adversarial dialogues with supportive rationales.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Unified evaluation framework for measuring sycophancy in scientific QA
	2. Introduction of Pressure-Tune method for enhancing factual consistency
	3. Demonstration of improvements across open-source and proprietary models

**Result:** Systematic evaluations demonstrate widespread sycophantic tendencies across various models, with Pressure-Tune improving resistance to sycophancy without sacrificing accuracy or responsiveness.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on scientific QA; implications for other domains remain to be explored.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method offers a pathway for enhancing the truthfulness of language models in scientific contexts by preserving factual integrity against user misinformation.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue, sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning, decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

**Motivation:** Current MGT detectors struggle with domain generalization, performing poorly on unseen domains due to domain shifts in data.

**Method:** MGT-Prism analyzes text representations in the frequency domain and includes a low frequency domain filtering module and a dynamic spectrum alignment strategy to enhance detector performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a frequency domain perspective to MGT detection
	2. Develops a low frequency domain filtering module
	3. Presents a dynamic spectrum alignment strategy

**Result:** MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 0.90% and an F1 score increase of 0.92% across 11 test datasets in three domain-generalization scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method demonstrates significant improvement in MGT detection across different domains, addressing the critical issue of domain shift.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

**Motivation:** To understand how large language models approximate child language and their implications in education.

**Method:** Comparison of LLM-generated texts to German children's descriptions through psycholinguistic text properties analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comparative analysis of LLMs with child language in a multimodal context
	2. Insights into LLM-generated language appropriateness for educational tools
	3. New data on psycholinguistic properties of LLM output

**Result:** LLM-generated texts are longer but less lexically rich and rely heavily on high-frequency words, with low semantic similarity to child-generated texts.

**Limitations:** The few-shot prompting showed only a minor increase in similarity; LLMs still struggle to replicate child-like language accurately.

**Conclusion:** Although few-shot prompting increases text similarity somewhat, LLMs still do not effectively replicate children’s lexical and semantic patterns, raising questions about their use in educational contexts.

**Abstract:** The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity, highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns. The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed educational tools.

**Method:** The authors annotated 500 medical abstracts for key aspects and proposed a fine-grained evaluation framework alongside a summarization pipeline called Track-Then-Sum.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TracSum benchmark for traceable summarization
	2. Development of a fine-grained evaluation framework
	3. Proposal of the Track-Then-Sum summarization pipeline

**Result:** Experiments show that TracSum serves as an effective benchmark and that sentence-level tracking before summarization improves accuracy, with full context enhancing completeness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TracSum facilitates better summarization while assuring users of factual accuracy through traceability.

**Abstract:** While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist, especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable, aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context. First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects, yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates large language models on their understanding of moral dimensions using a Bayesian framework, revealing that they often perform better than average human annotators in terms of moral detection.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To compare the understanding of moral dimensions between large language models and humans, specifically in terms of annotator disagreements and uncertainties.

**Method:** A large-scale Bayesian evaluation of language models was conducted using 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators across diverse text sources to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First large-scale Bayesian evaluation of language models on moral understanding
	2. Comparison of AI models against human annotators with a focus on uncertainty
	3. Demonstration of AI's superior performance in moral detection tasks.

**Result:** The study found that AI models rank among the top 25% of human annotators, achieving better-than-average balanced accuracy and producing fewer false negatives than humans.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AI models exhibit more sensitive moral detection capabilities compared to human annotators, despite their uncertainties.

**Abstract:** How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?   This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth (majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty (model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on 100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.   Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more sensitive moral detection capabilities.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** prompt engineering, length control, large language models

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel prompt-based strategy that enables large language models to generate text of a specified length accurately, without requiring fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of accurate length control in text generation by large language models, often leading to overshooting or undershooting of specified token counts.

**Method:** A prompt-based, one-shot strategy is developed that includes countdown markers and explicit counting rules, allowing models to generate text while keeping track of the total token count.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a countdown prompt that enhances length control in LLM output
	2. Achieved over 95% length compliance with GPT-4.1
	3. Showcased effectiveness across multiple generation settings

**Result:** The strategy significantly improves length compliance, achieving over 95% adherence on MT-Bench-LI compared to under 30% with naive prompts, while maintaining answer quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that effective length control in neural text generation can be achieved solely through prompt engineering, representing a practical alternative to more complex methods.

**Abstract:** Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs) remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters (Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens), XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt, surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to training- or decoding-based methods.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Natural Language Generation, Automatic Evaluation Metrics, Human Judgment, LLM Evaluation, Retrieval Augmented Generation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various automatic evaluation metrics for Natural Language Generation (NLG), examining their strengths, limitations, and correlations with human judgment.

**Read time:** 11 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The practical adoption of AI relies on effective evaluation of NLG, which has historically been challenging due to the costs and scalability issues of human assessments.

**Method:** An extensive examination of existing automatic evaluation metrics (AEMs) used in NLG, focusing on their methodologies, strengths, limitations, and relationships with human judgments, especially in the context of LLM and RAG.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. In-depth analysis of existing automatic evaluation metrics for NLG.
	2. Identification of challenges in current evaluation methodologies.
	3. Recommendations for task-specific metric selection and improved validation approaches.

**Result:** The study identifies that current metrics capture only certain aspects of text quality, vary in effectiveness depending on tasks and datasets, and often lack structured validation methods, leading to inconsistent correlations with human judgment.

**Limitations:** Metrics often do not capture the full spectrum of text quality and validation practices are inconsistent across studies.

**Conclusion:** Challenges persist in the pursuit of an ideal evaluation metric; selecting metrics should be task-specific and should focus on improved validation practices rather than seeking a single perfect metric.

**Abstract:** Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment. Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations, validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality, their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent. Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation methodologies.

**Abstract:** This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS) documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

**Motivation:** To address gaps in existing evaluation benchmarks for multimodal large language models, particularly in multilingual settings and comprehensive modality coverage.

**Method:** The study presents MME-SCI, comprising 1,019 high-quality question-answer pairs across subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, evaluated in 16 open-source and 4 closed-source models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of MME-SCI benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in science domains

	3. Identification of model weaknesses in reasoning capabilities through extensive evaluation.

**Result:** The experiments showed that MME-SCI is challenging for existing MLLMs, with notably low accuracy under the Image-only evaluation mode, indicating higher difficulty than previous benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained attributes allow for a deeper performance analysis of MLLMs, highlighting specific weaknesses in various domains.

**Abstract:** Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly, using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in specific domains.

**Abstract:** In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers. We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble).   While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the challenges of low diversity and factual inconsistencies in synthetic data when fine-tuning LLMs for long-context tasks.

**Method:** The proposed framework applies a Multi-Armed Bandit approach to select context chunks based on expected rewards, guiding the generation of responses and iteratively updating scores based on feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LongMab-PO framework for long-context modeling
	2. Utilization of Multi-Armed Bandit strategy for selecting context chunks
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks

**Result:** LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference data pairs, leading to state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The experimental results indicate that the framework effectively enables the collection of more informative and diverse responses for LLM training.

**Abstract:** Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks, including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses. Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks. All code and data will be released on https://github.com/NEUIR/LongMab-PO.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new strategy, Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS), for improving Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) training in Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing generation diversity and maintaining policy entropy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of vanilla RLVR training which improves Pass@1 performance at the cost of generation diversity, thereby hindering the overall reasoning capability of LLMs.

**Method:** The method proposed is an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy, which augments and updates training problems to mitigate entropy collapse by synthesizing variational problems that maintain identical reference answers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SvS strategy for RLVR training
	2. Demonstration of improved Pass@k performance in LLMs
	3. Analysis of generation diversity and entropy collapse in policy training

**Result:** The implementation of the SvS strategy led to significant performance improvements in Pass@k metrics, achieving gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while demonstrating consistent improvements across 12 reasoning benchmarks of various model sizes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the SvS strategy effectively enhances policy entropy during RLVR training, resulting in sustained performance improvements and broader robustness across different large language models.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations, we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of SvS.

**Motivation:** Recent advancements in LLMs allow them to perform complex tasks, but safety concerns during fine-tuning for agentic tasks are often overlooked, potentially leading to harmful behavior.

**Method:** PING uses automatically generated natural language prefixes added to agent responses, modifying behavior to improve refusal of harmful requests while maintaining performance on benign tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Prefix INjection Guard (PING) for ensuring safety in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of performance improvement in task execution safety
	3. Analysis of internal states showing prefix tokens are key to modifying behavior

**Result:** Experimental results show that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents, outperforming existing approaches in web navigation and code generation tasks.

**Limitations:** The paper includes content that may be considered unethical or offensive, which could pose ethical implications in its research.

**Conclusion:** PING effectively prevents fine-tuned LLMs from engaging in harmful actions without compromising their ability to execute benign tasks.

**Abstract:** Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

**Motivation:** Digital health analytics struggle with complex patient-generated health content requiring domain expertise, while traditional ML methods face data limitations and privacy issues.

**Method:** The study develops a structured codebook for expert interpretation, allowing LLMs to incorporate domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting, without the need for extensive training. Six GPT models are compared with BioBERT and lexicon-based methods using 400 expert-annotated posts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a structured codebook for LLMs to encode expert knowledge
	2. Demonstration of superior performance of LLMs in sentiment analysis of health content
	3. Validation of knowledge integration beyond pattern recognition with high expert agreement levels.

**Result:** LLMs performed better than traditional models, demonstrating high levels of expert agreement equivalent to inter-expert agreement, indicating a deeper knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern recognition.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of expert knowledge through in-context learning in LLMs presents a scalable solution for health data analysis, supporting real-time expert-quality insights for various health applications.

**Abstract:** Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement, with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics. This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health strategies.

**Conclusion:** The question-answering-based interaction with tables shows promise for improving NLP applications in manipulating and understanding structured data.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations that focuses on natural-language manipulation of tabular information sourced from academic pre-prints on ArXiv. The iTBLS dataset consists of three types of tabular tasks -- interpretation, modification, and generation. Interpretation focuses on tabular understanding, modification focuses on manipulating tabular information, and generation focuses on the addition of new natural-language evidence. In addition, the paper presents a novel framework that reformulates tabular operations as question-answering, where an appropriate question is formulated based on the nature of interaction and the question is answered using the user request as evidence. The developed approach results in an improvement on all tasks on a sequence-to-sequence modeling baseline on iTBLS. In addition, the question-answering-based reformulation is applied to datasets from prior work for the text-to-table task where textual paragraphs are summarized into tables. The novel approach results in up to 13% improvement in Exact-Match accuracy and up to 16% improvement in BERTScores compared to the prior state-of-the-art.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underrepresentation of the Nepali language in natural language processing due to limited resources and data.

**Method:** Collected 27.5 GB of Nepali text and pre-trained BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 models, followed by instruction tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Largest Nepali language corpus (27.5 GB) created for model training.
	2. Development and instruction tuning of BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 for Nepali.
	3. Demonstrated significant improvements over existing models in benchmarking and generation tasks.

**Result:** The pre-trained models scored 95.60 on the Nep-gLUE benchmark, outperforming the existing best model by 2 points, and showed improvements in text generation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The developed models lay a foundation for future research in NLP for the Nepali language, improving both understanding and generation.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based pre-trained language models have dominated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for quite some time now. However, the Nepali language, spoken by approximately 32 million people worldwide, remains significantly underrepresented in this domain. This underrepresentation is primarily attributed to the scarcity of monolingual data corpora and limited available resources for the Nepali language. While existing efforts have predominantly concentrated on basic encoder-based models, there is a notable gap in the exploration of decoder-based architectures. To address this gap, we have collected 27.5 GB of Nepali text data, approximately 2.4x larger than any previously available Nepali language corpus. Leveraging this data, we pre-trained three different models i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, exclusively for the Nepali Language. Furthermore, we performed instruction tuning and explored its potential for monolingual Nepali data, providing a foundation for future research. Our models outperformed the existing best model by 2 points on Nep-gLUE benchmark, scoring 95.60 and also outperformed existing models on text generation tasks, demonstrating improvements in both understanding and generating Nepali text.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of the Nepali Language Understanding Evaluation (NLUE) benchmark with twelve new datasets for NLP tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of the existing Nepali Language Understanding Evaluation (Nep-gLUE) benchmark, which only covers four tasks.

**Method:** Development of twelve new datasets for various NLU tasks, leading to the creation of the NLUE benchmark.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the NLUE benchmark with twelve new datasets
	2. Introduction of tasks such as Single-Sentence Classification and Natural Language Inference
	3. Demonstration of challenges faced by models in dealing with the complexity of Nepali language tasks

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that existing top models struggle with the added complexity of the new tasks; multilingual models generally outperform monolingual models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The NLUE benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating and advancing NLP models for low-resource languages like Nepali.

**Abstract:** The Nepali language has distinct linguistic features, especially its complex script (Devanagari script), morphology, and various dialects,which pose a unique challenge for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. While the Nepali Language Understanding Evaluation (Nep-gLUE) benchmark provides a foundation for evaluating models, it remains limited in scope, covering four tasks. This restricts their utility for comprehensive assessments of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. To address this limitation, we introduce twelve new datasets, creating a new benchmark, the Nepali /Language Understanding Evaluation (NLUE) benchmark for evaluating the performance of models across a diverse set of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. The added tasks include Single-Sentence Classification, Similarity and Paraphrase Tasks, Natural Language Inference (NLI), and General Masked Evaluation Task (GMET). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing top models struggle with the added complexity of these tasks. We also find that the best multilingual model outperforms the best monolingual models across most tasks, highlighting the need for more robust solutions tailored to the Nepali language. This expanded benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating, comparing, and advancing models, contributing significantly to the broader goal of advancing NLP research for low-resource languages.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces UniMedAbstractor (UMA), a zero-shot medical abstraction framework that uses frontier large language models to extract and normalize clinical attributes from unstructured medical texts without the need for extensive manual effort.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of extracting structured attributes from unstructured clinical notes, which is crucial for various applications like registry curation and clinical trials, and highlights the limitations of traditional medical abstraction methods that rely on attribute-specific models.

**Method:** The authors present UMA, which utilizes a modular and customizable prompt template for zero-shot medical abstraction, allowing users to adapt prompts easily for different attributes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of UniMedAbstractor (UMA) for zero-shot medical abstraction
	2. Elimination of attribute-specific training labels and handcrafted rules
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness across a range of oncology attributes with a single frontier model

**Result:** UMA was evaluated in oncology and demonstrated performance matching or exceeding that of traditional, tailored methods using a single frontier model such as GPT-4o across various clinical attributes related to the cancer patient journey.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework provides a scalable solution to medical abstraction, significantly reducing development time and eliminating the need for attribute-specific labels or handcrafted rules.

**Abstract:** A significant fraction of real-world patient information resides in unstructured clinical text. Medical abstraction extracts and normalizes key structured attributes from free-text clinical notes, which is the prerequisite for a variety of important downstream applications, including registry curation, clinical trial operations, and real-world evidence generation. Prior medical abstraction methods typically resort to building attribute-specific models, each of which requires extensive manual effort such as rule creation or supervised label annotation for the individual attribute, thus limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that existing frontier models already possess the universal abstraction capability for scaling medical abstraction to a wide range of clinical attributes. We present UniMedAbstractor (UMA), a unifying framework for zero-shot medical abstraction with a modular, customizable prompt template and the selection of any frontier large language models. Given a new attribute for abstraction, users only need to conduct lightweight prompt adaptation in UMA to adjust the specification in natural languages. Compared to traditional methods, UMA eliminates the need for attribute-specific training labels or handcrafted rules, thus substantially reducing the development time and cost. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of UMA in oncology using a wide range of marquee attributes representing the cancer patient journey. These include relatively simple attributes typically specified within a single clinical note (e.g. performance status), as well as complex attributes requiring sophisticated reasoning across multiple notes at various time points (e.g. tumor staging). Based on a single frontier model such as GPT-4o, UMA matched or even exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art attribute-specific methods, each of which was tailored to the individual attribute.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper evaluates the factual recall capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, introducing the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ) for assessment.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the inherent medical knowledge of LLMs in a high-stakes domain where accuracy is critical, especially given the limitations of existing medical QA benchmarks.

**Method:** The authors introduce the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ), derived from the UMLS, to evaluate LLMs' grasp of fundamental medical facts through a binary classification of concise statements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ) for measuring LLMs' medical knowledge retention.
	2. Identification of significant gaps in LLMs' factual recall capabilities in the medical domain.
	3. Demonstration of retrieval-augmented generation's effectiveness in improving decision-making accuracy.

**Result:** Experiments show LLMs struggle with accurately recalling medical facts, particularly with uncommon conditions and demonstrate poor calibration, being overconfident in incorrect answers.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on binary classification; further exploration may be needed for complex reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** Retrieval-augmented generation techniques can effectively improve LLMs' factual accuracy and reduce uncertainty in medical decision-making.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various downstream task domains. However, their abilities to directly recall and apply factual medical knowledge remains under-explored. Most existing medical QA benchmarks assess complex reasoning or multi-hop inference, making it difficult to isolate LLMs' inherent medical knowledge from their reasoning capabilities. Given the high-stakes nature of medical applications, where incorrect information can have critical consequences, it is essential to evaluate the factuality of LLMs to retain medical knowledge.   To address this challenge, we introduce the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ), a dataset derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a comprehensive repository of standardized biomedical vocabularies and knowledge graphs. Through a binary classification framework, MKJ evaluates LLMs' grasp of fundamental medical facts by having them assess the validity of concise, one-hop statements, enabling direct measurement of their knowledge retention capabilities.   Our experiments reveal that LLMs have difficulty accurately recalling medical facts, with performances varying substantially across semantic types and showing notable weakness in uncommon medical conditions. Furthermore, LLMs show poor calibration, often being overconfident in incorrect answers. To mitigate these issues, we explore retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving factual accuracy and reducing uncertainty in medical decision-making.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** vision-language models, basic-level categorization, human cognitive behavior

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper explores basic-level categorization in vision-language models and their alignment with human cognitive behavior.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study investigates how recently released vision-language models categorize visual stimuli and how this mirrors human categorization behavior.

**Method:** The authors analyze two open-source vision-language models: Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct and Molmo 7B-D, focusing on their performance in basic-level categorization tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of vision-language models aligning with human-like categorization behaviors.
	2. Analysis of nuanced categorization effects, including biological versus non-biological distinctions.
	3. Contradiction of the effectiveness of expert prompting methods in performance accuracy.

**Result:** Both models showed a preference for basic-level categorization, similar to human patterns, as well as nuanced behaviors like biological versus non-biological categorization effects.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that these models acquire complex cognitive behaviors from human training data, and challenge the notion that expert prompting yields better model performance.

**Abstract:** The field of psychology has long recognized a basic level of categorization that humans use when labeling visual stimuli, a term coined by Rosch in 1976. This level of categorization has been found to be used most frequently, to have higher information density, and to aid in visual language tasks with priming in humans. Here, we investigate basic-level categorization in two recently released, open-source vision-language models (VLMs). This paper demonstrates that Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct (11B) and Molmo 7B-D both prefer basic-level categorization consistent with human behavior. Moreover, the models' preferences are consistent with nuanced human behaviors like the biological versus non-biological basic level effects and the well-established expert basic level shift, further suggesting that VLMs acquire complex cognitive categorization behaviors from the human data on which they are trained. We also find our expert prompting methods demonstrate lower accuracy then our non-expert prompting methods, contradicting popular thought regarding the use of expertise prompting methods.

**Result:** The models, Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, achieve state-of-the-art performance on multilingual benchmarks for SEA languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The open-sourcing of the models aims to support the development of language technologies in the SEA region.

**Abstract:** Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the sociocultural and linguistic disparities in the Spanish language across different regions and their implications for AI language models.

**Method:** The paper examines the primary differences between variants of written Spanish in Latin America and Spain, providing sociocultural and linguistic context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies significant sociolinguistic differences among Spanish dialects
	2. Proposes five sub-variants of Spanish for AI language models
	3. Suggests improved localization strategies for enhanced inclusivity

**Result:** The paper highlights the need for locale-sensitive AI models to bridge sociolinguistic gaps, fostering trust in AI language models and improving localization strategies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Implementing the proposed sub variants of Spanish can enhance user trust, promote inclusivity, and support sustainable user growth for AI applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models are, by definition, based on language. In an effort to underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore, implementing at least the proposed five sub variants of Spanish addresses two lines of action: to foment user trust and reliance on AI language models while also demonstrating a level of cultural, historical, and sociolinguistic awareness that reflects positively on any internationalization strategy.
