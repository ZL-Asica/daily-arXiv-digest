### [1] [Athena: Intermediate Representations for Iterative Scaffolded App Generation with an LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20263)

*Jazbo Beason, Ruijia Cheng, Eldon Schoop, Jeffrey Nichols*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, User Interface Generation, Prototype Development, Human-Computer Interaction, App Storyboard

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Athena is a prototype application generation tool that helps developers create user interfaces using LLMs, employing intermediate representations to structure code generation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Generating complete user interfaces with LLMs is complex due to the intricacy of UI components and their interconnected files.

**Method:** The paper presents Athena, which uses shared intermediate representations like app storyboards, data models, and GUI skeletons to facilitate iterative UI development with LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of shared intermediate representations for UI generation
	2. Demonstration of iterative development with LLMs
	3. User study validating Athena's effectiveness over traditional methods

**Result:** A user study showed that 75% of participants preferred Athena over a traditional chatbot-style approach for app prototyping.

**Limitations:** The study's sample size and scope may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** Athena can enhance the code generation process by producing organized and structured output while reducing errors.

**Abstract:** It is challenging to generate the code for a complete user interface using a Large Language Model (LLM). User interfaces are complex and their implementations often consist of multiple, inter-related files that together specify the contents of each screen, the navigation flows between the screens, and the data model used throughout the application. It is challenging to craft a single prompt for an LLM that contains enough detail to generate a complete user interface, and even then the result is frequently a single large and difficult to understand file that contains all of the generated screens. In this paper, we introduce Athena, a prototype application generation environment that demonstrates how the use of shared intermediate representations, including an app storyboard, data model, and GUI skeletons, can help a developer work with an LLM in an iterative fashion to craft a complete user interface. These intermediate representations also scaffold the LLM's code generation process, producing organized and structured code in multiple files while limiting errors. We evaluated Athena with a user study that found 75% of participants preferred our prototype over a typical chatbot-style baseline for prototyping apps.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Framing, Visualization Design, Design Process, Strategic Judgment, Narrative Development

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This study examines the role of framing in the design process of visualization, identifying it as a critical component that influences problem scoping, data interpretation, and narrative development.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the underexamined role of framing in the design process of visualization, beyond its effects on audience perception.

**Method:** Analysis of podcasts and book chapters from over 80 professional visualization designers reflecting on their design practices.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies framing as a critical aspect of the design process in visualization.
	2. Explores conditions that trigger reframing in design.
	3. Outlines strategies used by practitioners to manage uncertainty.

**Result:** Framing is identified as a pervasive and iterative activity in visualization design, affecting various stages such as problem definition and stakeholder alignment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Framing is a core dimension of visualization practice that needs more focus in research and education to enhance practitioners' strategic judgment.

**Abstract:** Framing -- how designers define and reinterpret problems, shape narratives, and guide audience understanding -- is central to design practice. Yet in visualization research, framing has been examined mostly through its rhetorical and perceptual effects on audiences, leaving its role in the design process underexplored. This study addresses that gap by analyzing publicly available podcasts and book chapters in which over 80 professional visualization designers reflect on their work. We find that framing is a pervasive, iterative activity, evident in scoping problems, interpreting data, aligning with stakeholder goals, and shaping narrative direction. Our analysis identifies the conditions that trigger reframing and the strategies practitioners use to navigate uncertainty and guide design. These findings position framing as a core dimension of visualization practice and underscore the need for research and education to support the interpretive and strategic judgment that practitioners exercise throughout the design process.

### [3] [Human-Centered Design for Connected Automation: Predicting Pedestrian Crossing Intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20464)

*Sanaz Motamedi, Viktoria Marcus, Griffin Pitts*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** automated driving systems, pedestrian behavior, human-machine interaction, traffic safety, Theory of Planned Behavior

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study explores pedestrian decision-making in road-crossing scenarios with level-5 automated driving systems (ADSs), highlighting the impact of external factors on their behavior.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high fatality rates in road traffic due to human error and improve interactions between pedestrians and level-5 ADSs.

**Method:** The study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by adding four external factors (safety, trust, compatibility, understanding) and analyzes data from an online survey with 212 participants.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Extended TPB to include external factors relevant to ADSs
	2. Identified key predictors of pedestrian crossing intentions
	3. Provided insights for designing eHMIs and V2X strategies

**Result:** Data analysis reveals that perceived behavioral control, attitude, and social information predict crossing intentions, with safety and understanding being significant influencers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest the importance of designing effective human-machine interfaces and communication strategies for safer interactions between automated vehicles and pedestrians.

**Abstract:** Road traffic remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with pedestrians and other vulnerable road users accounting for over half of the 1.19 million annual fatalities, much of it due to human error. Level-5 automated driving systems (ADSs), capable of full self-driving without human oversight, have the potential to reduce these incidents. However, their effectiveness depends not only on automation performance but also on their ability to communicate intent and coordinate safely with pedestrians in the absence of traditional driver cues. Understanding how pedestrians interpret and respond to ADS behavior is therefore critical to the development of connected vehicle systems. This study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by incorporating four external factors (i.e. safety, trust, compatibility, and understanding) to model pedestrian decision-making in road-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs. Using data from an online survey (n = 212), results show that perceived behavioral control, attitude, and social information significantly predict pedestrians' crossing intentions. External factors, particularly perceived safety and understanding, strongly influence these constructs. Findings provide actionable insights for designing external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) and cooperative V2X communication strategies that support safe, transparent interactions between automated vehicles and pedestrians. This work contributes to the development of inclusive, human-centered connected mobility systems.

	1. Identifies and categorizes the conceptual fragmentation in spatial computing.
	2. Proposes a unified conceptual model for understanding spatial computing across disciplines.
	3. Highlights implications for future technological innovations in HCI and spatial interactions.

**Result:** Identified two schools of thought on spatial computing: one focusing on spatial data guiding interaction in the physical world, and the other emphasizing embodied engagement through the integration of physical and digital environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The synthesis of these perspectives establishes spatial computing as a transformative computational paradigm that redefines human interactions with environments.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in geographic information systems and mixed reality technologies have positioned spatial computing as a transformative paradigm in computational science. However, the field remains conceptually fragmented, with diverse interpretations across disciplines like Human-Computer Interaction, Geographic Information Science, and Computer Science, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of spatial computing and poses challenges for its coherent advancement and interdisciplinary integration. In this paper, we trace the origins and historical evolution of spatial computing and examine how "spatial" is understood, identifying two schools of thought: "spatial" as the contextual understanding of space, where spatial data guides interaction in the physical world; and "spatial" as a mixed space for interaction, emphasizing the seamless integration of physical and digital environments to enable embodied engagement. By synthesizing these perspectives, we propose spatial computing as a computational paradigm that redefines the interplay between environment, computation, and human experience, offering a holistic lens to enhance its conceptual clarity and inspire future technological innovations that support meaningful interactions with and shaping of environments.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limited insights from traditional gaze analyses in understanding visual attention dynamics and their impact on task performance in complex visual search scenarios.

**Method:** The proposed tool analyzes time series eye tracking data, incorporating gaze measures like fixations and saccades, and provides insights into temporal patterns and object-click sequences linked to user actions and performance metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of time series analysis for gaze data
	2. Visualization techniques that interpret complex gaze-stimuli connections
	3. Linking gaze behavior directly to user actions with performance metrics

**Result:** The tool reveals how attention evolves during task performance and provides comprehensive visualizations that clarify complex relationships between gaze behavior and user actions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This eye tracking analysis tool offers a robust framework for understanding cognitive processes and enhancing performance in interactive visual tasks.

**Abstract:** Eye Tracking (ET) can help to understand visual attention and cognitive processes in interactive environments. In attention tasks, distinguishing between relevant target objects and distractors is crucial for effective performance, yet the underlying gaze patterns that drive successful task completion remain incompletely understood. Traditional gaze analyses lack comprehensive insights into the temporal dynamics of attention allocation and the relationship between gaze behavior and task performance. When applied to complex visual search scenarios, current gaze analysis methods face several limitations, including the isolation of measurements, visual stability, search efficiency, and the decision-making processes involved in these scenarios. This paper proposes an analysis tool that considers time series for eye tracking data from task performance and also gaze measures (fixations, saccades and smooth pursuit); temporal pattern analysis that reveals how attention evolves throughout task performance; object-click sequence tracking that directly links visual attention to user actions; and performance metrics that quantify both accuracy and efficiency. This tool provides comprehensive visualization techniques that make complex patterns of stimuli and gaze connections interpretable.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Automatic Generation, Language Models, Multiple Choice Questions, Morphological Assessment, Structured Prompting

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The study investigates the use of language models for generating multiple choice questions to enhance morphological assessments, focusing on structured prompting and model efficiency.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high costs and inconsistencies associated with manual development of assessment tests for morphology.

**Method:** The study utilized a two-fold approach comparing a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma) with a larger untuned model (GPT-3.5) and evaluated various structured prompting strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the effectiveness of structured prompting for AIG in assessments.
	2. Highlighted the benefits of fine-tuning on mid-sized models under limited data conditions.
	3. Proposed a scalable workflow for generating and validating language assessment items.

**Result:** Structured prompting significantly improved the outputs of the Gemma model, generating more construct-aligned items compared to the untuned GPT-3.5 in zero-shot configurations.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on K-12 assessments and may not generalize to other educational levels or contexts.

**Conclusion:** Efficient fine-tuning and appropriate prompting strategies can enhance the performance of mid-sized language models for automated item generation in educational assessments.

**Abstract:** This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B) with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items for K-12.

**TL;DR:** Proposes Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) to enhance reasoning and search behavior in compact language models by using teacher demonstrations and guidance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the reasoning ability and performance of compact language models in reinforcement learning tasks, addressing issues of sparse rewards and unstable training.

**Method:** Introduces Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) which utilizes cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous guidance during policy optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) for compact language models.
	2. Development of Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC) as a fine-grained evaluation metric.
	3. Demonstration of compact models achieving advanced behaviors through teacher-guided training.

**Result:** DGPO allows compact models to exhibit advanced agentic behaviors, sometimes outperforming larger models, demonstrating its effectiveness in resource-constrained environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DGPO makes it feasible for compact language models to perform agentic RAG behaviors effectively, showing promising results in evaluation metrics and experiments.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [14] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)

*Haibo Jin, Ruoxi Chen, Peiyan Zhang, Andy Zhou, Yang Zhang, Haohan Wang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, AI Compliance, Ethics Guidelines, Jailbreak Diagnostics, Human-Computer Interaction

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces GUARD, a testing method designed to ensure compliance of Large Language Models (LLMs) with government-issued ethical guidelines. It aims to operationalize vague guidelines into actionable questions to assess LLM adherence, using automated generation of guideline-violating questions and diagnostics to identify unethical responses.

**Read time:** 54 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Governments have issued high-level ethics guidelines for AI, but there is a lack of processes to translate these into specific, actionable test questions to verify compliance, raising concerns about harmful AI responses.

**Method:** GUARD operationalizes guidelines into specific, guideline-violating questions and employs jailbreak diagnostics (GUARD-JD) to provoke guideline violations in LLM responses, assessing their compliance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced GUARD as a structured testing method for LLM compliance with ethical guidelines.
	2. Developed GUARD-JD for effective diagnostics of guideline-violating responses.
	3. Empirically validated against multiple LLMs and guidelines, showcasing transferability to other AI models.

**Result:** GUARD was empirically validated on seven LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in testing compliance with government-issued guidelines and identifying potential bypass scenarios for safety mechanisms.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GUARD produces compliance reports detailing adherence levels and violations, proving applicable not only to LLMs but also potentially transferable to vision-language models.

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.   To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.   We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents JERR, a framework to improve long-context comprehension in LLMs through graph-based reasoning.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models (LLMs) face challenges with long contexts and complex tasks due to memory limitations and lack of transparency.

**Method:** The JERR framework integrates synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational reasoning, using chunking for text summarization, building a directed acyclic graph to resolve redundancy, and employing Monte Carlo Tree Search for complex reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the JERR framework for long-context comprehension
	2. Use of graph-based reasoning for improved logical consistency
	3. Enhancement of interpretability in LLM outputs through MCTS

**Result:** JERR outperforms all baselines on ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** JERR provides a robust solution for enhancing LLMs' ability to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks reliably and transparently.

**Abstract:** Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically, allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently. Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for cost-effective alternatives to high-quality datasets for developing Long CoT behaviors in reasoning large language models.

**Method:** A two-stage post-training framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning on rejection-sampled NP-hard graph instances followed by reinforcement learning with a fine-grained reward design.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NP-hard graph problems as a synthetic training corpus for reasoning
	2. Development of a two-stage post-training framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning
	3. Demonstration of improved reasoning efficiency and accuracy in handling NP-hard problems.

**Result:** The model Graph-R1-7B achieves strong generalization across various domains and outperforms an existing large model on NP-hard graph problems in terms of accuracy and reasoning efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** NP-hard graph problems provide an effective and scalable resource for enhancing reasoning in language models, enabling further advancements in Long CoT reasoning.

**Abstract:** Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Personality Evaluation, Context-Aware, Response Consistency, Conversational History

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for assessing the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting the impact of prior conversational context on response consistency and personality shifts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional psychometric assessments on LLMs by incorporating the contextual history of conversations, leading to a more realistic evaluation of their behavioral traits.

**Method:** The paper proposes the CAPE framework, introducing novel metrics to assess the consistency of LLM responses based on prior conversational interactions and conducting experiments on 7 different LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CAPE framework for context-aware personality evaluation of LLMs.
	2. Development of novel metrics to quantify response consistency of LLMs based on conversational history.
	3. Demonstration of personality shifts in LLM responses influenced by prior interactions, with practical implications for Role Playing Agents.

**Result:** Experiments show that conversational history enhances response consistency but can induce personality shifts in models, with some models being more sensitive to context than others.

**Limitations:** The framework is contingent on the quality and relevance of prior conversations, which may not always represent real-world interactions comprehensively.

**Conclusion:** The CAPE framework improves the evaluation of LLMs by accounting for context, making their responses better aligned with human judgments, particularly in applications involving Role Playing Agents.

**Abstract:** Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits. However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs, incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.   Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions, whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions. Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at: https://github.com/jivnesh/CAPE

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, reasoning utility, conditional entropy, MATH dataset, answer correctness

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the role of intermediate reasoning steps in large language models and their contribution to answer correctness, finding that decreasing conditional entropy during reasoning indicates higher accuracy.

**Read time:** 11 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how reasoning utility affects the correctness of answers generated by large language models, particularly in the context of autoregressive generation.

**Method:** An oracle study on the MATH dataset was conducted using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains. A separate model (Qwen3-8B) was employed to quantify the utility of these chains based on conditional entropy at each reasoning step.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the relationship between reasoning utility and answer correctness
	2. Establishes that decreasing conditional entropy correlates with correct answers
	3. Provides insights into the efficiency of reasoning pipelines for LLMs

**Result:** The study found that decreasing conditional entropy during reasoning is associated with correct answers, while incorrect paths tend to be longer and have flat or increasing entropy.

**Limitations:** The study relies on specific models and datasets, which may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** These findings highlight the need for efficient reasoning pipelines that can identify and avoid unproductive reasoning early in the generation process.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness. Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final decision.   We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DentalBench, the first bilingual benchmark for the dental field.
	2. Development of a large-scale dental corpus for model adaptation.
	3. Evaluation of various LLMs revealing performance gaps and the impact of domain adaptation.

**Result:** Significant performance gaps were found across task types and languages, and domain adaptation notably improved model performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

**Limitations:** Focused solely on dentistry, with potential applicability limited to generalization without additional domain-specific resources.

**Conclusion:** Domain-specific benchmarks are essential for developing effective LLMs in healthcare applications, confirming the potential for improved trustworthiness in medical AI.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However, their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale, high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks, and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating KG-CQR into RAG tasks like multi-hop question answering consistently improves retrieval effectiveness over existing baselines.

**Abstract:** The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR, a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6% improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval effectiveness

**Abstract:** Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match score.

**Abstract:** We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names, plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows - capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

**Conclusion:** The framework is effective and resilient in predicting outcomes from multimodal EHRs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating natural language processing techniques and prompt learning.

**Abstract:** Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs. Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Conspiracy theories undermine trust in science, making it crucial to understand their structure and the impact of AI-generated misinformation.

**Method:** ConspirED is created by annotating excerpts from conspiracy articles using the CONSPIR cognitive framework to identify traits of conspiratorial ideation and test LLM robustness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ConspirED dataset for conspiratorial content
	2. Development of models to identify conspiratorial traits
	3. Evaluation of LLM robustness against conspiracy-related inputs

**Result:** The computational models identify key conspiratorial traits and reveal that LLMs reflect conspiratorial reasoning patterns in their outputs even when countering misinformation.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the dataset's representativeness of all conspiratorial content and the potential biases in LLM responses.

**Conclusion:** Understanding conspiratorial ideation through ConspirED and evaluating LLMs can help mitigate the spread of AI-generated misinformation.

**Abstract:** Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework (Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model (LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked misinformation.

### [28] [Languages Still Left Behind: Toward a Better Multilingual Machine Translation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20511)

*Chihiro Taguchi, Seng Mai, Keita Kurabe, Yusuke Sakai, Georgina Agyei, Soudabeh Eslami, David Chiang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multilingual machine translation, evaluation benchmarks, cultural bias, FLORES+, translation quality

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper critiques the FLORES+ multilingual machine translation benchmark for its inadequacies in evaluation, particularly due to domain-specific and culturally biased source texts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of FLORES+ in evaluating multilingual machine translation systems across various languages and contexts.

**Method:** The authors conducted human assessments on translations in four languages, focusing on quality and cultural bias, and analyzed performance metrics using alternative evaluation sets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of FLORES+ benchmark evaluation practices
	2. Demonstration of vulnerable scoring methodologies with heuristics
	3. Recommendation for culturally neutral evaluation standards

**Result:** Human evaluations showed many translations failed to meet the claimed quality standards, and high-quality models struggled with FLORES+, emphasizing the benchmark's flaws.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to four specific languages and may not generalize across all multilingual scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The study calls for improved multilingual MT benchmarks that are culturally neutral and less reliant on named entities to better represent real-world translation challenges.

**Abstract:** Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+ benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over 200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani) and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities, in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a new method for topic discovery in scientific literature using large language models (LLMs) to improve the identification of research topics.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To provide better tools for researchers to identify emerging trends and enhance scientific information retrieval through improved topic discovery methods.

**Method:** The proposed method, SciTopic, utilizes a textual encoder to analyze scientific publications, coupled with an entropy-based sampling module and triplet tasks guided by LLMs to optimize thematic relevance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SciTopic, an LLM-enhanced topic discovery method
	2. Novel integration of entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
	3. Demonstrated superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that SciTopic significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in scientific topic discovery.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of LLMs in SciTopic enhances the precision of topic identification in scientific literature, facilitating faster and deeper insights for researchers.

**Abstract:** Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the challenges of non-IID data in federated learning, addressing both label diversity and input diversity in natural language processing.

**Method:** A unified benchmarking framework is proposed to evaluate federated learning with a focus on multi-domain non-IID scenarios, complemented by the AdaFD framework for improving model performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a unified benchmarking framework for multi-domain non-IID scenarios in federated learning.
	2. Development of Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) to enhance performance with diverse data.
	3. Demonstration of improved model effectiveness in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.

**Result:** The AdaFD framework successfully addresses multi-domain non-IID challenges and outperforms existing methods by effectively capturing diversity among local clients.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adopting the proposed benchmarking framework and AdaFD method leads to improved performance and better evaluation of federated learning frameworks in real environments.

**Abstract:** The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However, previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label (output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains (input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared to the existing works.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** The framework outperforms existing production baselines on multiple industry-relevant metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency with low resource requirements.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the generative model-based approach greatly enhances QDTS capabilities in industrial web search settings, overcoming key limitations of traditional models.

**Abstract:** In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments, have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency, requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per second under 55~ms average latency per query.

**Result:** KCS improves the accuracy of knowledge composition selection by 3.9% compared to competitive baselines and shows effective data augmentation results on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed KCS framework successfully enhances the generation of diverse multi-hop questions and demonstrates good performance in data augmentation for multi-hop question answering benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying question generation through content planning and varied expression. However, these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in evaluating GLMs' ability to perform multimodal reasoning that combines graph structure and language semantics.

**Method:** Introduction of the CLEGR benchmark with synthetic graph generation and reasoning questions, followed by evaluations of various GLM architectures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CLEGR benchmark for multimodal reasoning
	2. Analysis of GLM architectures against soft-prompted LLM performance
	3. Identification of limitations in GLMs' graph reasoning capabilities

**Result:** GLM architectures do not significantly outperform soft-prompted LLMs, indicating that the graph structure may not be necessary for high performance in certain tasks.

**Limitations:** Evaluation primarily focused on specific architectures and may not encompass all types of GLMs.

**Conclusion:** Current GLM models struggle with structural reasoning and may not need integration of graph structures with LLMs, revealing potential limitations in graph-based reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning. These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

**Motivation:** End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often misinterpret domain-specific named entities, which leads to failures in subsequent tasks.

**Method:** The proposed NEC method utilizes speech sound features to identify candidate entities and employs a generative approach to annotate and replace incorrect entities in ASR transcripts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel NEC method leveraging speech sound features
	2. Generative approach for annotating and correcting entity errors in ASR transcripts
	3. Open-sourcing of self-constructed test set and training data

**Result:** The results show that the new NEC method significantly improves entity accuracy compared to traditional models, especially in cases where the wrongly transcribed words differ greatly from the correct entities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This method represents a significant advancement in the correction of entity recognition in ASR systems, with open-source datasets to aid further research.

**Abstract:** End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities. With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test set and training data.

**Motivation:** To improve the quality of text-based steganography and watermarking by addressing tokenization inconsistency (TI) which undermines robustness.

**Method:** Two tailored methods are proposed: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking to eliminate TI.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed solutions for eliminating tokenization inconsistency in steganography and watermarking.
	2. Demonstrated improvements in various metrics for both steganography and watermarking through experiments.
	3. Identified key characteristics of problematic tokens that lead to tokenization inconsistency.

**Result:** Experiments show that directly addressing TI improves fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity in steganography, and enhances detectability and robustness in watermarking.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the critical nature of addressing tokenization inconsistency to strengthen steganography and watermarking techniques.

**Abstract:** Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against attacks.

**Result:** rStar2-Agent achieved state-of-the-art performance with an average pass@1 score of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25 in just 510 RL steps in one week.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The model demonstrates strong generalization beyond mathematics to alignment and scientific reasoning tasks, with significant improvements over larger models.

**Abstract:** We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use tasks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Differential Privacy, Natural Language Processing, Semantic Triples, Document Generation, LLM Post-Processing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces DP-ST, a method for generating private documents under local Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees using semantic triples, balancing privacy and utility.

**Read time:** 17 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of transforming text under Differential Privacy while maintaining high coherence and utility, especially at lower ε values.

**Method:** DP-ST leverages semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation combined with LLM post-processing to ensure coherent text generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel method (DP-ST) for document generation under local DP
	2. Demonstration of coherent text generation at lower ε values through semantic triples
	3. Evaluation of the divide-and-conquer paradigm in the context of privacy and utility.

**Result:** DP-ST demonstrates effective text generation that maintains coherence and balances privacy even at lower ε values, highlighting the significance of neighborhood-aware strategies.

**Limitations:** The performance of DP-ST may still depend on the specific contexts or types of documents being processed.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that by focusing on privatization neighborhoods, it is possible to achieve reasonable levels of privacy without sacrificing the quality of generated text.

**Abstract:** Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees. Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method for detecting implicit hate speech by fine-tuning general-purpose embedding models based on large language models, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The detection of implicit hate speech is crucial due to its subtlety and the challenges posed by the use of indirect language, sarcasm, and coded terminology in conveying prejudice.

**Method:** The authors fine-tune recent general-purpose embedding models, namely Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed, and E5, focusing on the incorporation of emotional and contextual information to enhance detection performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Fine-tuning of LLM-based embedding models for IHS detection
	2. Demonstrated improvement in detection metrics across multiple datasets
	3. Integration of contextual and emotional data into detection pipelines

**Result:** The method achieved up to a 1.10 percentage point improvement in F1-macro score on in-dataset evaluations, and up to a 20.35 percentage point improvement in cross-dataset evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Fine-tuning LLMs for implicit hate speech detection significantly enhances performance and sets a new standard in this area.

**Abstract:** Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

**TL;DR:** GUARD is a self-adaptive decoding method that balances coherence and diversity in LLM outputs by using a novel uncertainty-driven framework.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of balancing coherence and diversity in open-ended text generation with LLMs, which is often hindered by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs.

**Method:** GUARD utilizes a 'Glocal' uncertainty-driven approach, combining global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to manage both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals effectively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel 'Glocal' uncertainty-driven framework for decoding methods in LLMs.
	2. Achieved improvements in generation speed without sacrificing text quality.
	3. Provided theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency for the proposed method.

**Result:** Experimental results show that GUARD achieves a balance between text diversity and coherence and improves generation speed, with validation from both human and LLM evaluators.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GUARD provides a robust solution for enhancing LLM output quality by mitigating abrupt variations in uncertainty while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the emotional dynamics in therapy dialogues generated by LLMs versus those from real sessions, assessing the implications for mental health applications.

**Method:** We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to compare emotional arcs in real CBT dialogues with LLM-generated dialogues from the CACTUS dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comparative analysis of emotional arcs in real vs. synthetic therapy dialogues
	2. Introduction of RealCBT, a dataset of real CBT sessions for future research
	3. Insights into the emotional fidelity deficiencies of LLM-generated therapy dialogues

**Result:** Synthetic dialogues are fluent but lack the emotional variability and authenticity found in real sessions, particularly low emotional arc similarity for clients.

**Limitations:** The analysis is limited to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dialogues and may not generalize to other therapeutic approaches.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight significant limitations in LLM-generated therapy data and the need for authentic emotional representation in mental health applications.

**Abstract:** Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future research in this space.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper presents Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a method for enhancing safety alignment in Large Language Models by modifying weight matrices to improve refusal rates of harmful requests without extensive fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing safety mechanisms in LLMs can be bypassed, necessitating new approaches to enhance safety alignment.

**Method:** ROSI involves a simple rank-one modification of write matrices in the model's residual stream, informed by harmful and harmless instruction pairs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) technique for LLM safety enhancement
	2. Proven effectiveness of ROSI in increasing safety refusal rates
	3. Demonstration of ROSI's ability to realign uncensored models with latent safety directions

**Result:** ROSI significantly increases safety refusal rates, as shown by evaluations with Llama Guard 3, while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks like MMLU and HellaSwag.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ROSI serves as an efficient last-mile safety procedure that effectively enhances LLM safety using interpretable weight steering without the need for extensive model fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper, we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple, fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions, demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning paradigms.

**Conclusion:** Early detection of cognitive distortions can enable timely interventions, but model performance is highly variable based on linguistic factors.

**Abstract:** Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text. One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our findings show that while changes in language and writing style can significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most promise.

**TL;DR:** GDLLM is a Global Distance-aware approach for Event Temporal Relation Extraction, improving the identification of temporal relations in Natural Language Processing by enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models, particularly for minority relation classes.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) using Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing limitations of minority class relations in imbalanced datasets and noise introduced by manual prompts.

**Method:** We propose GDLLM, which integrates a distance-aware graph structure with Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a soft inference-based temporal feature learning paradigm to enhance the learning of long-distance and short-distance dependencies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the GDLLM framework
	2. Integration of distance-aware graph structure with LLMs
	3. State-of-the-art performance on temporal relation extraction tasks.

**Result:** GDLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TB-Dense and MATRES datasets, particularly improving the identification of minority relation classes in ETRE.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework significantly enhances LLM's learning capabilities and overall performance in temporal relation extraction.

**Abstract:** In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability. Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a framework to evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on multi-source information integration and long-form response generation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing evaluations of RAG systems are limited to single-source or short-form queries, failing to address real-world scenarios requiring information synthesis across multiple sources.

**Method:** A scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks for RAG systems is introduced, along with two new benchmarks: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, focused on narrative synthesis and summarization, respectively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a scalable framework for evaluating RAG systems on multi-source tasks
	2. Development of two new benchmarks for narrative synthesis and summarization
	3. Demonstration that reasoning models are more effective than LLMs in multi-source synthesis scenarios.

**Result:** Experiments showed that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval effectiveness, which varies by task, and reasoning models outperformed standard LLMs in multi-source synthesis tasks.

**Limitations:** The benchmarks do not cover all possible real-world complexities of multi-source information retrieval and synthesis.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes that effective retrieval is crucial for long-form response generation from diverse sources, and existing models need advancements to improve synthesis quality.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs -- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the implications of quantization on deploying large language models (LLMs) for multilingual tasks, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

**Method:** Conducted a large-scale evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) using five LLMs with varying parameters, examining four quantization techniques across high- and low-resource languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First large-scale evaluation of PTQ on machine translation across 55 languages.
	2. Identification of the impact of quantization techniques on translation quality for different language resources.
	3. Insights into model calibration and decoding hyperparameters under low-bit conditions.

**Result:** 4-bit quantization generally maintains translation quality for high-resource languages, but 2-bit quantization leads to significant quality loss in low-resource and diverse languages. GGUF variants performed consistently well, especially at 2-bit precision.

**Limitations:** Limited exploration of other language modeling tasks beyond machine translation; focuses mainly on specific quantization techniques.

**Conclusion:** The study provides insights into the deployment of multilingual LLMs in translation tasks under quantization constraints, stressing the importance of model size and quantization methods.

**Abstract:** Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision. Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SageLM demonstrates a more comprehensive and effective approach to evaluating Speech-to-Speech LLMs by integrating multiple aspects of dialogue quality and providing improved explainability.

**Abstract:** Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods. Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset, and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate IRMA's superior reliability and consistency as a reformulation approach for tool-calling agents in dynamic environments.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning, adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

	3. A plug-in module that enhances hidden representations for better semantic alignment

**Result:** The proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches on four benchmarks across three semantic parsing tasks using various recent LLMs for inference.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new two-stage approach provides a strong balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance, making it effective for semantic parsing tasks in ICL settings.

**Abstract:** In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time models.

**Abstract:** Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively. Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the vulnerability of LLMs to backdoor attacks, highlighting the need for comprehensive defenses against a range of attack types.

**Method:** LETHE combines an internal approach using a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, and an external mechanism that adds benign evidence to prompts, distracting the model from backdoor features.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LETHE for backdoor defense in LLMs
	2. Demonstrated superiority of LETHE over eight state-of-the-art defense methods
	3. Proved effectiveness across multiple widely used language models

**Result:** Experimental results show that LETHE significantly reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% across five popular LLMs, while preserving model utility.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LETHE is a cost-efficient and robust solution to enhance the security of LLMs against a variety of backdoor attacks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve sentential relation extraction in NLP and understand the factors influencing performance on different datasets.

**Method:** The approach utilizes dynamic routing in capsules to enhance the extraction of relations between sentences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Dynamic routing in capsules for sentential relation extraction
	2. Identification of noise in labels as a performance inhibitor
	3. Introduction of the concept of re-representation for better matching

**Result:** The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04 datasets, but faces challenges with noise in the labels of the larger Wikidata dataset.

**Limitations:** The findings regarding noise in Wikidata labels highlight limitations in generalizability to larger datasets.

**Conclusion:** Re-representation is identified as a significant aspect of improving performance in sentential relation extraction, with implications for understanding the impact of label noise.

**Abstract:** Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance. Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge in sentential RE.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Tax filing involves complex reasoning and high stakes due to potential penalties for errors, necessitating accurate automated systems.

**Method:** The proposed system integrates large language models with a symbolic solver, enhancing performance through translation of tax rules into formal logic and using exemplars for case representations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of LLMs with symbolic solvers for tax filing automation
	2. Method for estimating deployment costs based on penalties
	3. Improvement of performance via translation of text rules into formal logic

**Result:** Evaluations on the StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset show improved performance and cost reductions compared to traditional methods.

**Limitations:** The dependency on the quality of the symbolic reasoning component may limit generalization to all tax scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Neuro-symbolic architectures can significantly enhance access to reliable tax assistance while maintaining economic feasibility.

**Abstract:** According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

**Motivation:** To systematically investigate how cultural values are represented in PTLMs and their implications in cross-cultural applications.

**Method:** The authors introduce probes to analyze and compare the values embedded in PTLMs against established cross-cultural value surveys.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced probes for analyzing cultural values in PTLMs
	2. Found weak alignment of PTLM values with cultural surveys
	3. Discussed implications and alignment strategies for PTLMs in cross-cultural settings

**Result:** The study finds that PTLMs capture cultural value differences, but these do not strongly align with established value surveys.

**Limitations:** The exploration of cultural values is still nascent and the methods may not capture all aspects of cultural nuances.

**Conclusion:** Misalignment of values in PTLMs may have implications for their use in diverse cultural contexts, suggesting a need for alignment methods.

**Abstract:** Language embeds information about social, cultural, and political values people hold. Prior work has explored social and potentially harmful biases encoded in Pre-Trained Language models (PTLMs). However, there has been no systematic study investigating how values embedded in these models vary across cultures. In this paper, we introduce probes to study which values across cultures are embedded in these models, and whether they align with existing theories and cross-cultural value surveys. We find that PTLMs capture differences in values across cultures, but those only weakly align with established value surveys. We discuss implications of using mis-aligned models in cross-cultural settings, as well as ways of aligning PTLMs with value surveys.

**Motivation:** The need for wider adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their size and resource requirements motivates the exploration of new compression techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD) for LLM compression
	2. Demonstration of layer-specific optimization in weight decomposition
	3. Significant KV cache memory reductions without performance loss

**Result:** ASVD can compress LLM networks by 10%-30% and achieve up to 50% reduction in KV cache memory requirements without any performance drop.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed ASVD method contributes to more efficient deployment of LLMs by significantly reducing size and resource demands while maintaining performance.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

**Motivation:** To improve keyword expansion in information retrieval by exploring semantic neighbourhoods of words beyond direct similarities.

**Method:** The LGDE method creates a word similarity graph using word embeddings and applies local community detection based on graph diffusion to capture complex word similarities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel method for semantic neighbourhood discovery using local graph techniques.
	2. Validation of LGDE on real-world datasets and domains.
	3. Demonstration of improved keyword expansion for information retrieval tasks.

**Result:** Validation on user-generated corpora shows that LGDE enriches keyword lists significantly more than traditional methods based on direct similarities or co-occurrences.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LGDE effectively expands the seed dictionary with more relevant keywords, as demonstrated in a real-world application in communication science.

**Abstract:** We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.

**Abstract:** We introduce the Extract-Refine-Retrieve-Read (ERRR) framework, a novel approach designed to bridge the pre-retrieval information gap in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through query optimization tailored to meet the specific knowledge requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike conventional query optimization techniques used in RAG, the ERRR framework begins by extracting parametric knowledge from LLMs, followed by using a specialized query optimizer for refining these queries. This process ensures the retrieval of only the most pertinent information essential for generating accurate responses. Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce computational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that utilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined through knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on various question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems show that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a versatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of RAG systems.

**Motivation:** The study investigates the impact of multiPLM choice on ranking quality in parallel data curation, which is crucial for enhancing NMT performance.

**Method:** The authors analyze multiPLMs (LASER3, XLM-R, LaBSE) using web-mined corpora (CCMatrix and CCAligned) across various language pairs and apply heuristics to reduce noise in top-ranked sentences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies biases in multiPLMs that affect ranking quality in data curation.
	2. Proposes heuristics for noise reduction in top-ranked sentence pairs.
	3. Demonstrates improvements in NMT performance with filtered datasets.

**Result:** The research demonstrates that different multiPLMs show biases towards specific sentence types, leading to noise in the top-ranked samples. Heuristics employed significantly reduce this noise.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By refining the ranking process with heuristics, the quality of data for NMT training can be improved, benefiting performance and consistency across different multiPLMs.

**Abstract:** Parallel Data Curation (PDC) techniques aim to filter out noisy parallel sentences from the web-mined corpora. Prior research has demonstrated that ranking sentence pairs using similarity scores on sentence embeddings derived from Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models (multiPLMs) and training the NMT systems with the top-ranked samples, produces superior NMT performance than when trained using the full dataset. However, previous research has shown that the choice of multiPLM significantly impacts the ranking quality. This paper investigates the reasons behind this disparity across multiPLMs. Using the web-mined corpora CCMatrix and CCAligned for En$\rightarrow$Si, En$\rightarrow$Ta and Si$\rightarrow$Ta, we show that different multiPLMs (LASER3, XLM-R, and LaBSE) are biased towards certain types of sentences, which allows noisy sentences to creep into the top-ranked samples. We show that by employing a series of heuristics, this noise can be removed to a certain extent. This results in improving the results of NMT systems trained with web-mined corpora and reduces the disparity across multiPLMs.

**Read time:** 40 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the computational mechanisms behind LLMs' capabilities in formal and functional linguistic tasks can inform their design and application.

**Method:** The study compares 'circuits', or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various tasks in 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of distinct circuits for formal and functional tasks in LLMs.
	2. Comparison of task circuits across multiple LLMs.
	3. Insights into the functional architecture of LLMs inspired by neuroscience.

**Result:** It was found that circuits for formal and functional tasks exhibit little overlap, as do circuits for different formal tasks, complicating the search for a unified formal linguistic network.

**Limitations:** The study does not conclusively identify a unified network and focuses on current model limitations.

**Conclusion:** The separation between formal and functional mechanisms suggests potential shared mechanisms for formal tasks, but a single unified network has not yet been identified.

**Abstract:** Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable, these capabilities are unevenly distributed: they excel at formal linguistic tasks, such as producing fluent, grammatical text, but struggle more with functional linguistic tasks like reasoning and consistent fact retrieval. Inspired by neuroscience, recent work suggests that to succeed on both formal and functional linguistic tasks, LLMs should use different mechanisms for each; such localization could either be built-in or emerge spontaneously through training. In this paper, we ask: do current models, with fast-improving functional linguistic abilities, exhibit distinct localization of formal and functional linguistic mechanisms? We answer this by finding and comparing the "circuits", or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various formal and functional tasks. Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that while there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional tasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists in the human brain. Thus, a single formal linguistic network, unified and distinct from functional task circuits, remains elusive. However, in terms of cross-task faithfulness - the ability of one circuit to solve another's task - we observe a separation between formal and functional mechanisms, suggesting that shared mechanisms between formal tasks may exist.

**Motivation:** To explore the effectiveness of detecting satirical tones specifically in news headlines, independent of the main article.

**Method:** The study tests various models, including traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models, with a focus on Bidirectional Transformer models and the meta-learning Reptile approach.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the feasibility of detecting satire in headlines without main article context
	2. Introduced the meta-learning Reptile approach in examining satirical headlines
	3. Showed superiority of Bidirectional Transformer models over traditional methods for this task

**Result:** The experiments reveal that Bidirectional Transformer models significantly surpass standard machine learning methods and LLMs in detecting satire in headlines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that focusing on headlines alone can be a viable method for identifying satirical content, with advanced models providing better accuracy.

**Abstract:** The primary goal of a news headline is to summarize an event in as few words as possible. Depending on the media outlet, a headline can serve as a means to objectively deliver a summary or improve its visibility. For the latter, specific publications may employ stylistic approaches that incorporate the use of sarcasm, irony, and exaggeration, key elements of a satirical approach. As such, even the headline must reflect the tone of the satirical main content. Current approaches for the Romanian language tend to detect the non-conventional tone (i.e., satire and clickbait) of the news content by combining both the main article and the headline. Because we consider a headline to be merely a brief summary of the main article, we investigate in this paper the presence of satirical tone in headlines alone, testing multiple baselines ranging from standard machine learning algorithms to deep learning models. Our experiments show that Bidirectional Transformer models outperform both standard machine-learning approaches and Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly when the meta-learning Reptile approach is employed.

### [67] [Multilingual Contextualization of Large Language Models for Document-Level Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12140)

*Miguel Moura Ramos, Patrick Fernandes, Sweta Agrawal, André F. T. Martins*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Language Models, Document Translation, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method for enhancing document-level translation using large language models (LLMs) by introducing a curated dataset called DocBlocks for targeted fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Improving long-document translation, which remains a challenge due to long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena.

**Method:** Targeted fine-tuning on a curated dataset (DocBlocks) that supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DocBlocks for document-level translation training
	2. Demonstration of enhanced translation quality using multiple paradigms
	3. Improvement in inference speed over prompting and agent-based methods.

**Result:** Incorporating multiple translation paradigms significantly enhances both the quality and speed of document-level translation compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges in document-level translation by improving cross-sentence dependency capture while maintaining sentence-level performance.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in sentence-level machine translation, but scaling to document-level translation remains challenging, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena across sentences and paragraphs. In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks. Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods.
