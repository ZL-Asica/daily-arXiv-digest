### [1] [Super Kawaii Vocalics: Amplifying the "Cute" Factor in Computer Voice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06235)

*Yuto Mandai, Katie Seaborn, Tomoyasu Nakano, Xin Sun, Yijia Wang, Jun Kato*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** kawaii, vocalics, HCI, computer voices, emotional response

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the vocal aspects of the Japanese concept of 'kawaii' (cuteness) in computer voices, providing insights into manipulating voice characteristics to enhance perceived cuteness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the under-researched area of kawaii vocalics in computer voices and determine how voice characteristics can be manipulated to evoke kawaii perceptions.

**Method:** Conducted a four-phase study with 512 participants examining two types of computer voices (text-to-speech and game character) to identify elements of voice that correlate with kawaii.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the concept of kawaii vocalics to the field of HCI.
	2. Provided empirical data connecting voice characteristics with kawaii perception.
	3. Developed a basic method for manipulating voices to evoke kawaii responses.

**Result:** Identified 'sweet spots' in vocal manipulation, highlighting certain fundamental and formant frequency adjustments that enhance kawaii perception, with noted limitations based on voice types.

**Limitations:** Findings indicate a ceiling effect for certain voices in relation to kawaii vocalics, suggesting manipulation effectiveness may vary.

**Conclusion:** Established an empirical basis for a kawaii vocalics model and provided an initial method for manipulating perceptions of computer voice in relation to cuteness.

**Abstract:** "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet, virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

### [2] [Ragged Blocks: Rendering Structured Text with Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06460)

*Sam Cohen, Ravi Chugh*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** text visualization, layout algorithm, ragged blocks, semantic information, document rendering

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a layout algorithm that enables the use of 'ragged blocks' for rich text visualizations while preserving typography.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve text visualizations beyond current flat decorations and nested boxes that disrupt typographic layout.

**Method:** A layout algorithm is introduced that generates ragged blocks or rocks, allowing for compact nested text rendering with rich styling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new layout algorithm for ragged blocks.
	2. Demonstration of substantial compactness improvements over traditional layouts.
	3. Presentation of use cases for enhanced semantic styling in document rendering.

**Result:** The ragged block layouts are shown to be significantly more compact than conventional rectangular layouts in a benchmark of various programming languages' source code.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Future text editors and document-rendering GUIs can effectively convey rich semantic information through the styled ragged block layout.

**Abstract:** Whether it be source code in a programming language, prose in natural language, or otherwise, text is highly structured. Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed.   In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding.   We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages, we show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage scenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other document-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through domain-specific styling of ragged blocks.

*Kyla Ellahiyoun, Emma Jane Pretty, Renan Guarese, Marcel Takac, Haytham Fayek, Fabio Zambetta*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** musical training, cognitive load, task accuracy, virtual reality, exergame

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the impact of musical training on cognitive load and task accuracy in the VR exergame Beat Saber.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine how musical training affects cognitive load and task performance in a virtual reality gaming context.

**Method:** Participants (N=32) played Beat Saber at varying difficulty levels while their physiological data were collected. Post-task questionnaires assessed subjective cognitive load and task accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the influence of musical training on task accuracy in VR exergame settings.
	2. Identified the relationship between gaming experience and subjective cognitive load.
	3. Suggested avenues for future research on musical expertise and its effects on cognitive processes.

**Result:** Musical training significantly predicted higher task accuracy; however, it did not directly reduce subjective cognitive load. Difficulty and gaming experience were key predictors of cognitive load.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Musical training contributes to improved performance in tasks but does not necessarily alleviate cognitive load. Future studies should explore different categorizations of musical expertise and examine the concepts of flow and self-efficacy.

**Abstract:** This study explores the relationship between musical training, cognitive load (CL), and task accuracy within the virtual reality (VR) exergame Beat Saber across increasing levels of difficulty. Participants (N=32) completed a series of post-task questionnaires after playing the game under three task difficulty levels while having their physiological data measured by an Emotibit. Using regression analyses, we found that task difficulty and gaming experience significantly predicted subjective CL, whereas musical training did not. However, musical training significantly predicted higher task accuracy, along with lower subjective CL, increased gaming experience, and greater physiological arousal. These results suggest that musical training enhances task-specific performance but does not directly reduce subjective CL. Future research should consider alternative methods of grouping musical expertise and the additional predictability of flow and self-efficacy.

**Conclusion:** The study asserts the need for more collaboration between CSOs, academia, and the open-source community to create effective monitoring tools accessible to civil society.

**Abstract:** The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures. Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content, CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

### [9] [Tailoring deep learning for real-time brain-computer interfaces: From offline models to calibration-free online decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06779)

*Martin Wimpff, Jan Zerfowski, Bin Yang*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** brain-computer interfaces, deep learning, real-time decoding, adaptive pooling, domain adaptation

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** Introduction of realtime adaptive pooling (RAP) for real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) addressing challenges of offline deep learning applications.

**Read time:** 7 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome limitations in offline deep learning applications for real-time brain-computer interface decoding, particularly pertaining to computational complexity and data scarcity.

**Method:** The paper introduces a novel parameter-free method called realtime adaptive pooling (RAP) that modifies pooling layers in offline deep learning models for online decoding. It decodes sliding windows efficiently and uses source-free domain adaptation to reduce data needs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a parameter-free method for real-time decoding in BCIs
	2. Reduction in computational complexity for online applications
	3. Improvement in adaptability to scarce data through source-free domain adaptation

**Result:** RAP framework shows improved robustness and efficiency for real-time BCI applications, preserving privacy while minimizing calibration needs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RAP paves the way for broader deep learning adoption in online BCIs, facilitating user-centered, high-performance systems that offer immediate feedback and aid user learning.

**Abstract:** Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning.

### [10] [Toward Neurodivergent-Aware Productivity: A Systems and AI-Based Human-in-the-Loop Framework for ADHD-Affected Professionals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06864)

*Raghavendra Deshmukh*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** ADHD, Human-Computer Interaction, AI/ML, attention management, adaptive tools

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a framework for developing adaptive support tools targeting adults with ADHD in digital work environments, leveraging AI/ML and human-in-the-loop design to enhance attention management without disruption.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges faced by adults with ADHD in high-distraction, digital work environments, where conventional productivity tools often fall short in supporting neurodivergent professionals.

**Method:** The proposed framework combines Systems Thinking, Human-in-the-Loop design, and AI/ML to create a privacy-first adaptive assistant that detects user attention states through on-device machine learning, providing tailored nudges and prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a framework integrating Systems Thinking and Human-in-the-Loop design for ADHD support.
	2. Implementation of on-device ML to infer attention states from user interaction.
	3. Provision of privacy-first adaptive nudges that enhance executive function without disruption.

**Result:** The framework results in a replicable model for adaptive tools that provide inclusive support based on real-time attention state inference, aimed at enhancing regulation and productivity.

**Limitations:** The framework may require extensive testing with real users to refine its effectiveness and ensure it meets the diverse needs of neurodivergent individuals.

**Conclusion:** The model showcases the potential of adaptive, privacy-focused AI tools to assist neurodivergent individuals in managing attention and productivity in complex work settings.

**Abstract:** Digital work environments in IT and knowledge-based sectors demand high levels of attention management, task juggling, and self-regulation. For adults with ADHD, these settings often amplify challenges such as time blindness, digital distraction, emotional reactivity, and executive dysfunction. These individuals prefer low-touch, easy-to-use interventions for daily tasks. Conventional productivity tools often fail to support the cognitive variability and overload experienced by neurodivergent professionals. This paper presents a framework that blends Systems Thinking, Human-in-the-Loop design, AI/ML, and privacy-first adaptive agents to support ADHD-affected users. The assistant senses tab usage, application focus, and inactivity using on-device ML. These cues are used to infer attention states and deliver nudges, reflective prompts, or accountability-based presence (body doubling) that aid regulation without disruption. Technically grounded in AI, the approach views attention as shaped by dynamic feedback loops. The result is a replicable model for adaptive, inclusive support tools in high-distraction work environments.

**Conclusion:** PersonaFlow demonstrates that customizable AI-simulated personas can effectively enhance research ideation, creativity, and collaboration while providing users a greater sense of control over the process.

**Abstract:** Generating interdisciplinary research ideas requires diverse domain expertise, but access to timely feedback is often limited by the availability of experts. In this paper, we introduce PersonaFlow, a novel system designed to provide multiple perspectives by using LLMs to simulate domain-specific experts. Our user studies showed that the new design 1) increased the perceived relevance and creativity of ideated research directions, and 2) promoted users' critical thinking activities (e.g., interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, and self-regulation), without increasing their perceived cognitive load. Moreover, users' ability to customize expert profiles significantly improved their sense of agency, which can potentially mitigate their over-reliance on AI. This work contributes to the design of intelligent systems that augment creativity and collaboration, and provides design implications of using customizable AI-simulated personas in domains within and beyond research ideation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To bridge the gap in deriving meaningful insights from passive sensing streams and aid experts in the complex sensemaking process.

**Method:** Conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts following a human-centered design process to develop and evaluate Vital Insight, a prototype system for human-in-the-loop inference and visualizations of sensing data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the Vital Insight (VI) prototype system for sensemaking

**Result:** Experts interacted with the Vital Insight prototype, leading to the development of an expert sensemaking model and identification of design implications for future AI-augmented visualization systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the importance of supporting experts in their sensemaking processes through AI-assisted tools, particularly for multi-modal health sensing data.

**Abstract:** Passive tracking methods, such as phone and wearable sensing, have become dominant in monitoring human behaviors in modern ubiquitous computing studies. While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.   We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data.

**TL;DR:** The study explores the vocal elements of 'kawaii' in computer voices and provides methods for manipulating perceptions of cute voice characteristics.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To formalize the new science of kawaii vocalics, which had been largely overlooked in favor of visual representations of kawaii.

**Method:** A four-phase study with a grand N of 512 participants, examining manipulation of text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices through fundamental and formant frequency adjustments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of kawaii vocalics in computer voices
	2. Identification of manipulative sweet spots for kawaii
	3. Empirical validation of a kawaii vocalics model

**Result:** Identified 'sweet spots' for kawaii vocalics in certain voices, with limitations on effectiveness and a ceiling effect for some voice types.

**Limitations:** Effectiveness is limited to specific voices and may reach a ceiling effect.

**Conclusion:** Validated the kawaii vocalics model and proposed a method for influencing perceptions of cute in computer-generated voices.

**Abstract:** "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet, virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

We analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses, and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona, and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing more engaging, socially responsive systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective monitoring of harmful online content as platform providers reduce investment in content moderation.

**Method:** Investigating the collaborative development of an open-source monitoring tool with CSOs to leverage their expertise in identifying harmful content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed collaboration model between CSOs and AI tool developers.
	2. Identification of gaps in current open-source monitoring solutions.
	3. Emphasis on the active role of CSOs rather than passive consumption.

**Result:** CSOs can significantly enhance the detection of harmful content through their thematic expertise, yet current collaborations and practical implementations are limited.

**Limitations:** Limited research on the practical applications of tools developed in collaboration with civil society actors.

**Conclusion:** Active involvement of CSOs in tool development is critical for creating effective AI solutions for monitoring harmful content.

**Abstract:** The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures. Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content, CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

**Motivation:** To present advanced AI models capable of high-performance reasoning and coding, especially in multimodal contexts.

**Method:** Introduction of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash models with a focus on their capabilities and performance metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Gemini 2.5 Pro with state-of-the-art performance.
	2. Enhanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities.
	3. Cost-effective models for high performance and low latency.

**Result:** Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance on coding and reasoning tasks, while Gemini 2.5 Flash provides strong reasoning at lower compute costs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Gemini 2.X model generation offers varied capabilities to suit different user needs for agentic problem-solving tasks.

**Abstract:** In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

**Motivation:** The goal is to ensure LLM responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations, as previous findings show LLMs often display overconfidence in English.

**Method:** The study analyzes the distribution of epistemic markers generated by LLMs and measures human reliance rates on these generations across five different languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of multilingual linguistic calibration of LLMs
	2. Identification of cultural differences in users' reliance on LLM outputs
	3. Highlighting the need for context-specific safety evaluations for LLMs

**Result:** The analysis reveals that LLMs are overconfident across languages but vary in the use of uncertainty markers; for example, they generate more markers of uncertainty in Japanese compared to certainty markers in German and Mandarin.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** There is a high risk of overreliance on overly confident LLM outputs across languages, which necessitates an understanding of linguistic and cultural variations for better model safety evaluations.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a global context.   We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages, reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English. Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Extend at Test-Time (ETT), a method that enables the extension of context length in Transformer-based LLMs with efficient memory usage and improved accuracy.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges posed by the quadratic computation and memory overhead of Transformer-based Language Models when processing long sequences.

**Method:** ETT fine-tunes model parameters on input contexts chunked into overlapping subsequences, allowing for context length extension at test-time with constant memory requirements and linear computation overhead.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a method for extending context length in LLMs with constant memory and linear computation overhead.
	2. Demonstration of improved accuracy on long sequences.
	3. Insights on effective fine-tuning of Transformer modules at test-time.

**Result:** ETT successfully extends the context length of models like GPT-Large and Phi-2 from 1k to 32k tokens, achieving up to a 30% improvement in model accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach demonstrates that specific fine-tuning strategies can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs when handling long sequences.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a growing need to integrate formal, distributional, and grounded approaches to computational semantics to leverage their strengths while addressing their weaknesses.

**Method:** The paper reviews existing literature on the words-as-classifier model and presents a small experiment to demonstrate its efficacy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposal of the words-as-classifiers model as a unifying framework for semantics
	2. Review of prior literature demonstrating the model's applicability
	3. Initial experimental validation of the model in dialogue settings

**Result:** The words-as-classifiers model has been shown to be effective in integrating visual knowledge into language models, particularly in interactive dialogue applications.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A unified semantic model leveraging words-as-classifiers could enhance our understanding and application of computational semantics in AI systems.

**Abstract:** Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal, distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science, and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics unified through words-as-classifiers.

**Keywords:** tokenization, morphological alignment, language models, MorphScore, evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the quality of tokenizers by expanding the MorphScore metric to 70 languages and examining its correlation with the performance of language models on various tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the unclear evaluation of tokenizer quality, specifically through the lens of morphological alignment and its impact on model training and performance.

**Method:** We expanded MorphScore to support 70 languages and correlated alignment scores with the performance of five pre-trained language models on seven tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Expansion of MorphScore to include 70 languages
	2. Correlation analysis of alignment scores with downstream model performance
	3. Insights into the limitations of morphological alignment as a quality measure

**Result:** The study reveals that morphological alignment does not significantly correlate with model performance, indicating it does not fully capture important aspects of tokenizer quality.

**Limitations:** The findings suggest that while MorphScore is a useful metric, it may not encompass all dimensions of tokenizer quality that affect model performance.

**Conclusion:** Morphological alignment alone is insufficient for measuring tokenizer quality in relation to model performance in language tasks.

**Abstract:** While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore (Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to model performance.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a framework that extends syntactic head functions to hypermagma structures, integrating operations and relations in syntactic theory via colored operads.

**Read time:** 48 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the extensions of magma structures in syntax and how these can be expressed within the framework of colored operads.

**Method:** The authors develop a mathematical framework relating head functions to hypermagma structures and colored operads, demonstrating connection with syntactic rules and phases using formal operations like Merge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of hypermagma structure in syntax
	2. Formulation of head and complement structures using colored operads
	3. Unification of syntactic movement principles under operad theory

**Result:** The paper presents relationships between syntactic structures and operators, proposing that movement and compatibility in phases can be modeled through colored operads, subsuming existing syntactic rules.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings establish a unified model for various syntactic principles, structured through the lens of colored operads and hypermagma.

**Abstract:** We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions, and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored operads and a transduction of colored operads.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces PERK, a method that improves long-context reasoning by efficiently encoding contexts using a lightweight model adapter.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of accurately reasoning over extensive, noisy inputs and the limitations of memory-intensive meta-learning methods in long-context settings.

**Method:** PERK employs two nested optimization loops: an inner loop that rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter, and an outer loop that uses the updated adapter for reasoning over the encoded context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a lightweight model adapter for efficient long-context reasoning.
	2. Demonstration of significant performance gains over standard prompt-based methods.
	3. Scalability of inference despite higher training memory requirements.

**Result:** PERK achieves significant performance improvements on long-context reasoning tasks, with up to 90% gains in smaller models and 27% in larger models compared to prompt-based baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** While PERK requires more memory during training, it is more efficient during inference, outperforming standard approaches in various complexity scenarios.

**Abstract:** Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive, preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline, achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models (GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces REFORM, a method for improving the robustness of reward modeling in large language models by identifying and correcting failure modes through adversarial training.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The work addresses the limitations of existing reward models that struggle with human preference complexity and distributional shifts, proposing a practical solution for enhanced robustness.

**Method:** The method involves reward guided controlled decoding to discover failure modes, using adversarial examples to augment training data, thereby improving the reward model's performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces REFORM, a self-improving reward modeling framework
	2. Implements a method to discover reward model failure modes
	3. Demonstrates significant improvements on preference datasets

**Result:** REFORM was evaluated on two preference datasets showing significant robustness improvements and better alignment quality without compromising reward quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework enhances the ability of reward models to handle complex human preferences and improves overall model performance and robustness.

**Abstract:** Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets, reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality. Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing spurious correlations.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the global deployment of LLMs, it is essential to ensure their responses are calibrated in various languages to accurately represent uncertainty and limitations, as previous studies revealed a tendency towards overconfidence in English. The study aims to address these issues to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a multilingual context.

**Method:** The research involved analyzing the distribution of epistemic markers generated by LLMs across five languages, measuring human reliance on these markers, and identifying cross-linguistic variations in user behavior related to confidence and uncertainty in LLM outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigated multilingual linguistic calibration in LLMs.
	2. Analyzed user reliance on LLM-generated epistemic markers across five languages.
	3. Highlighted the significance of cultural context in LLM safety evaluations.

**Result:** The study found that LLMs exhibit cross-linguistic overconfidence, with significant variation in the usage of epistemic markers. Users display varying reliance on these markers, relying more on expressions of uncertainty in some languages like Japanese compared to English.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on only five languages, which may not capture the full spectrum of multilingual risks associated with LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the need for linguistically and culturally contextualized evaluations of model safety to mitigate the risks of overreliance on LLMs in different languages.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a global context.   We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin.

Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach significantly enhances LLM performance on various downstream tasks by refining prompt interpretation through model decomposition.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the use of the dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse over time, revealing shifts in focus from greenhouse gases to implementation and finance.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess global responses to complex challenges like climate change and evaluate past priorities, while addressing the limitations of traditional manual coding techniques.

**Method:** The dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) is applied to a corpus of UNFCCC policy decisions from 1995 to 2023 to analyze temporal dynamics in climate policy themes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Application of DETM for analyzing climate policy discourse
	2. Identification of temporal shifts in policy themes
	3. Demonstrated scalability and effectiveness of the modeling approach

**Result:** The DETM model effectively reveals shifts in climate policy focus from early international conventions to recent themes of implementation and financial strategies.

**Limitations:** Limited to UNFCCC policy decisions and may not generalize to other contexts without further adaptation.

**Conclusion:** DETM is a scalable tool for analyzing global policy discourse, with implications for future research and applications to other policy domains.

**Abstract:** Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed, particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions. In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse. A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building, finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline, including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The current reinforcement learning techniques for LLMs are optimized for textual tasks, leading to poor performance in multimodal reasoning, particularly in perceiving visual inputs.

**Method:** PAPO extends the Generalized Recurrent Policy Optimization (GRPO) by adding an Implicit Perception Loss using a KL divergence term, promoting the model's learning of perception along with reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO) for multimodal reasoning
	2. Significant improvement in perception and reasoning tasks without relying on additional data
	3. Development of Double Entropy Loss to mitigate loss hacking issues

**Result:** PAPO yields significant improvements of 4.4% on various multimodal benchmarks and up to 8.0% on vision-dependent tasks, along with a substantial reduction in perception errors by 30.5%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work establishes a new RL framework that integrates perception-aware supervision into RLVR, supporting better visually grounded reasoning.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning.

**Motivation:** Time normalization is crucial for converting temporal expressions into formats usable by machines, impacting fields like information retrieval and clinical decision-making. Traditional methods are limited in handling complex temporal constructs.

**Method:** The authors propose a time normalization formulation grounded in the SCATE framework, implementing a Python library that generates executable SCATE code, and employing LLMs for automatic data augmentation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new formulation for time normalization as a code generation task.
	2. Implementation of a SCATE framework to define temporal semantics accurately.
	3. Creation of an automatic data augmentation pipeline using LLMs for synthesizing annotated data.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that models trained on LLM-augmented data outperform existing methods, providing strong accuracy and interpretability in time normalization tasks.

**Limitations:** The performance might vary with different contexts or the complexity of the temporal expressions beyond the tested scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method significantly enhances time normalization capabilities, enabling effective deployment of smaller models while maintaining performance.

**Abstract:** Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional, event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time normalization.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the quadratic complexity and memory issues of Transformers when processing long sequences, the adoption of linear attention mechanisms and their hybridization is crucial.

**Method:** The study systematically evaluates various linear attention models (including vector recurrences and gating mechanisms) across generations, analyzing both standalone and hybridized configurations using 72 models trained at different parameter sizes and token counts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of various linear attention models in hybrid architectures
	2. Open-sourced 72 trained models for future research
	3. Identification of key mechanisms for effective hybrid models

**Result:** The study finds that while standalone linear models can perform well, they do not always excel when hybridized with full attention. Recall performance improves with more full attention layers, especially under a 3:1 linear-to-full ratio.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research emphasizes the importance of selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled forgetting in hybrid models and recommends specific architectures for optimal performance.

**Abstract:** Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences, prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance, leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers. Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio. Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1 to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/collections/m-a-p/hybrid-linear-attention-research-686c488a63d609d2f20e2b1e.

**Abstract:** Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead to misleading confidence in responses.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research offers a significant contribution to the intersection of translation studies and computational linguistics, enhancing the understanding of language models in handling semantic ambiguity and cultural awareness in humor.

**Abstract:** Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with specialized techniques for wordplay generation.   Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and regenerating puns with feedback.   Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.   This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for successful humor.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SpindleKV effectively addresses the challenges associated with KV cache in LLMs, reducing memory consumption while maintaining or enhancing inference performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV, which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar or even better model performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** InvestAlign presents a promising method for enhancing LLM performance and alignment in behavioral finance contexts involving herd behavior.

**Abstract:** Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a discursive-network model for understanding the interactions between humans and large-language models (LLMs) and explores the concept of 'invalidation' along with hazards that impact the reliability of these interactions.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how large-language models function in a live exchange with users and to investigate factors that compromise the reliability of such exchanges.

**Method:** Development of a mathematical model for discursive networks that examines the dynamics between humans and LLMs, focusing on the concept of invalidation and its associated hazards.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a discursive-network model for LLM interactions
	2. Identification of four hazards affecting truth in LLM exchanges
	3. Development of the Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm for peer review mechanisms

**Result:** The study finds that a network of LLMs governed by certain conditions can stabilize at low error rates, while adding fabrication increases error rates similar to existing LLM behaviors. Peer review mechanisms can shift the network towards a truth-dominant state.

**Limitations:** The model may not account for all real-world complexities in human-LLM interactions and is based on theoretical assumptions.

**Conclusion:** Reliability in interactions between humans and LLMs is achieved not by perfect models but through interconnected networks of imperfect models that critically evaluate each other.

**Abstract:** Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The use of structured knowledge combined with generative techniques effectively enhances QA performance in the food domain, ensuring both factual and visual accuracy.

**Abstract:** We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000 recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate 40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by 31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\% adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

**Motivation:** Investigate the efficiency potential of representation sharing in State Space Models (SSMs) for language modeling.

**Method:** Propose the Gated Memory Unit (GMU) and apply it to the SambaY architecture, which integrates GMUs in a cross-decoder setup.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Gated Memory Unit (GMU) for memory sharing
	2. Development of SambaY architecture
	3. Demonstrated significant performance scalability and efficiency improvements

**Result:** SambaY achieves lower irreducible loss compared to YOCO, enhancing scalability and 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The model shows significant performance improvements in reasoning tasks while maintaining efficiency, with all code released for open-source use.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We release our training codebase on open-source data at https://github.com/microsoft/ArchScale.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FuDoBa for embedding fusion
	2. Utilization of Bayesian optimization for improved efficiency
	3. Benchmarking on six datasets demonstrating superior performance

**Result:** FuDoBa produced low-dimensional, task-relevant representations that reduce training complexity and yield interpretable weights, performing comparably or better than proprietary LLM-based embedding methods across six datasets from two domains.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach enhances classification performance and makes the process more interpretable by leveraging both LLM embeddings and domain-specific structured knowledge.

**Abstract:** Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge, sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based embedding baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To expedite data extraction in reviews using LLMs under a structured protocol and assess their effectiveness.

**Method:** Two approaches with Claude 3.5 Sonnet were trialed to prompt data extraction and review from evidence sources in a scoping review.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLM performance in data extraction contexts
	2. Identification of strengths and weaknesses in LLM data capture
	3. Recommendations for future protocols using LLMs

**Result:** The high accuracy (83.3% to 100%) for simple data contrasted with low accuracy (9.6% to 15.8%) for complex items, highlighting issues with recall and F1 scores.

**Limitations:** Performance evaluation was limited and may not generalize across diverse contexts or data types.

**Conclusion:** LLM-based methods require more thorough evaluation and comparisons to traditional approaches, with suggested improvements based on LLM feedback.

**Abstract:** The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%) when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6% and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1 scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of 38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value. However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors, only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review protocol drafting.

**Relevance Score:** 3

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a novel measure of elite polarization using AI to analyze political speeches and emotional evaluations among political actors, establishing a new index of mutual out-party hostility.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To create a comprehensive measure of elite polarization that can be analyzed over time and political contexts. This measure helps understand how political elites evaluate one another in terms of hostility.

**Method:** The methodology includes analyzing parliamentary speeches to detect actors and subjects, assessing emotional tones, and aggregating data to create an index that captures mutual out-party hostility.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel index of elite polarization based on AI analysis of parliamentary speeches.
	2. Establishment of a methodology to assess and quantify mutual out-party hostility over long time periods.
	3. Presentation of a dataset that can inform political science research on elite behavior.

**Result:** The developed index effectively reflects levels of elite polarization in several countries over recent decades, responding to significant political events like elections and crises.

**Limitations:** The analysis is currently limited to specific countries (UK, Hungary, Italy) and may not capture the full spectrum of political contexts across all EU nations.

**Conclusion:** The index serves as a valuable tool for measuring and understanding elite polarization, potentially applicable for a broader EU-wide dataset in the future.

**Abstract:** This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations. This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming power.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the generation of clinical text while overcoming challenges posed by unstructured and dense clinical notes.

**Method:** The framework uses a hierarchical chunking strategy and a dual-stage retrieval mechanism to generate structured progress notes from clinical data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CLI-RAG for structured clinical text generation
	2. Hierarchical chunking strategy tailored for clinical document structure
	3. Task-specific dual-stage retrieval mechanism for enhanced relevance

**Result:** Achieved an average alignment score of 87.7%, higher than the baseline of 80.7% from real clinician-authored notes, with high consistency across LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CLI-RAG demonstrates efficient handling of clinical documents, ensuring temporal and semantic alignment and reinforcing trust in generated outputs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms, have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However, real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2) clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting clinically relevant information.   We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.   We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset. Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7% baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on only a limited number of datasets and models, which may affect generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest caution in using simplistic methods to detect uncertainty in LLM outputs, highlighting the importance of using interpretability methods to better understand inference processes.

**Abstract:** Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

**Conclusion:** CE-Judge provides an effective and efficient approach for multilingual evaluation in NLP using open-source models without extensive training.

**Abstract:** Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning, raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

**Motivation:** To expedite the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by leveraging domain and expert knowledge.

**Method:** The approach involves five steps using SysML diagrams to extract information about system components, employing NLP strategies and LLMs to enhance the generation process of diagrams and computational models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Automated generation of SysML diagrams for dynamical systems
	2. Integration of NLP and LLM strategies to improve model output

**Result:** The method demonstrated improved performance in generating computational models of complex dynamical systems compared to using LLMs alone, illustrated through various case studies including a simple pendulum example.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed strategy can be applied broadly across various domains and is not confined to specific computational systems or software.

**Abstract:** This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to overcome the fundamental limitations of current inference techniques in large language models by creating a framework that can effectively leverage both sequential and parallel reasoning.

**Method:** The authors propose a test-time collaborative inference framework which utilizes an intrinsic quality metric, semantic entropy, to assess the quality of model responses dynamically and enable controlled reasoning processes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a collaborative inference framework for LLMs
	2. Introduction of semantic entropy as a quality assessment metric
	3. Demonstration of improved efficiency in LLM inference

**Result:** The introduction of semantic entropy shows a strong negative correlation with accuracy, providing a reliable metric for evaluating reasoning quality during collaborative inference, which demonstrates improved efficiency.

**Limitations:** The study does not thoroughly explore the practical implementation complexities of the proposed framework in real-world applications.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework aims to enhance the performance of large language models by effectively combining sequential and parallel reasoning while addressing their individual limitations through the use of semantic entropy as a quality metric.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning (iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff; while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

**Motivation:** Existing retrieval methods in RAG fail to collectively satisfy complex information requirements in multi-hop question answering, often only considering individual passage relevance.

**Method:** SETR uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to identify query information needs and selects an optimal set of passages that work together effectively.

**Key Contributions:**

	3. Outperformance against existing rerankers in multi-hop question answering

**Result:** SETR significantly improves answer correctness and retrieval quality compared to both proprietary and open-source rerankers on multi-hop RAG benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SETR offers an efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems, enhancing the retrieval process for complex queries.

**Abstract:** Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SCoRE's modular, efficient, and adaptable design makes it a superior choice for practical relation extraction tasks.

**Abstract:** The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE), particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD), measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures, and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

**Keywords:** GUI agents, LVLM, backdoor attacks, visual grounding, VisualTrap

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper reveals security vulnerabilities in GUI agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), specifically focusing on backdoor attacks that can hijack visual grounding of agents used for human-machine interaction.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The emergence of GUI agents using LVLMs presents significant security risks, especially with regard to backdoor attacks that undermine their functionality and trustworthiness.

**Method:** The paper introduces VisualTrap, a method that hijacks the visual grounding of GUI agents by injecting poisoned data during pre-training to mislead the agent's localization of textual plans.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of vulnerabilities in visual grounding of GUI agents
	2. Development of VisualTrap as a method for hijacking visual localization
	3. Demonstration of effective stealthy attacks with minimal poisoned data

**Result:** VisualTrap can effectively compromise the visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data, using stealthy visual triggers applicable across various GUI environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for increased research into the security vulnerabilities of GUI agents, particularly regarding backdoor attack risks and their implications for safe operation.

**Abstract:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show MIND outperforms existing zero-shot approaches and generalizes well across different model architectures and parameter scales.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MIND provides a scalable solution for detecting harmful memes, potentially improving content moderation on social media.

**Abstract:** The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need to explore how multiple defendants and charges should be treated in legal judgment prediction (LJP).

**Method:** The paper evaluates several prevailing legal LLMs on four practical legal judgment scenarios, including charge prediction and penalty term prediction, using a newly created dataset (MPMCP).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MPMCP dataset for legal judgment prediction.
	2. Evaluation of multiple LLMs across different legal judgment scenarios.
	3. Insights into model performance variations in complex legal settings.

**Result:** The evaluation found that the scenario with multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) presents the greatest challenges, with significant variations in model performance across different scenarios.

**Limitations:** The study may not generalize to all legal systems or jurisdictions, and further research is needed to refine model performance in real-world applications.

**Conclusion:** The performance of legal LLMs is heavily influenced by the complexity of the legal judgment scenarios, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in LJP.

**Abstract:** Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1, InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD, while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to understand tutor strategies in dialogues arises from their impact on student learning outcomes, especially in the context of increasing online learning and AI-driven tutoring systems.

**Method:** The study employed two math tutoring dialogue datasets to assess the prediction capabilities of Llama 3 and GPT-4o concerning tutor moves and their effects on student outcomes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of tutor strategy prediction in dialogues using LLMs.
	2. Analysis of the correlation between tutor strategies and student outcomes.
	3. Identification of the limitations of current LLMs in predicting pedagogical moves.

**Result:** The findings reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs often fail to accurately predict future tutor strategies, even though these strategies are strongly correlated with student success.

**Limitations:** Current LLMs are inadequate for accurately predicting tutor strategies despite their relevance to student outcomes.

**Conclusion:** The research concludes that existing LLMs require enhancement for more effective tutor strategy prediction and emphasizes the necessity for advanced methods in this area.

**Abstract:** Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to approach this task.

**Motivation:** To address the shortcomings in existing code evaluation benchmarks that miss subtle faults due to their limited and homogeneous test cases, thus inflating performance metrics and hindering accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning settings.

**Method:** The authors propose a new methodology that involves multi-dimensional metrics to quantify test-suite thoroughness and introduce SAGA, a collaborative method that combines human programming expertise with LLM reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of multi-dimensional metrics for test-suite thoroughness
	2. Development of SAGA, which combines human and LLM strengths for better test-case generation
	3. Creation of TCGBench for systematic study and evaluation of test-case generation methods

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work contributes to reliable LLM code evaluation, advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, and lays groundwork for automatic adversarial test synthesis.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The authors propose an evaluation framework for practitioners to systematically assess the query-level robustness of RAG pipelines, offering actionable recommendations based on their findings.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally, we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of distributed training and inference with sensitive data in regulated industries, enabling collaboration while preserving data privacy.

**Method:** FlexOlmo utilizes a mixture-of-experts architecture where individual experts are trained on closed datasets and can be integrated through domain-informed routing without joint training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a new architecture for distributed training on closed datasets
	2. Enables flexible inference with improved performance
	3. Surpasses existing model merging techniques and standard MoE approaches.

**Result:** FlexOlmo achieves an average 41% relative improvement in performance on 31 diverse downstream tasks compared to general experts and surpasses prior model merging methods by 10.1% while maintaining the same training FLOPs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** FlexOlmo provides a solution for benefiting from closed data in regulated environments, balancing data utilization and privacy concerns effectively.

**Abstract:** We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1) distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference, where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active) on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by 10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting fine-grained control of data access during inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance conversational search systems by overcoming the limitations of separate models that fail to leverage combined knowledge effectively.

**Method:** Joint fine-tuning of retrieval and generation mechanisms, along with two design mechanisms to minimize inconsistency and data discrepancy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Unified approach to conversational search
	2. Joint fine-tuning strategy
	3. Evaluation on multiple datasets showcasing performance improvements

**Result:** The unified model significantly improves both retrieval and generation tasks, outperforming existing baselines on five datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed unified approach demonstrates mutual improvements in conversation tasks, suggesting a more effective framework for conversational AI.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Discrete Diffusion Models, Natural Language Generation, Autoregressive Models

**TL;DR:** This thesis investigates discrete diffusion models for natural language generation, comparing them with autoregressive models in terms of generative performance and processing speed.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the challenges of applying diffusion models to discrete data, such as natural language, which involve token dependencies and lack of generation order.

**Method:** The research evaluates the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compares its performance to traditional autoregressive (AR) models using metrics like Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), and Batch Processing Speed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Detailed analysis of discrete diffusion models for NLP
	2. Comparison of D3PM with traditional autoregressive models
	3. Evaluation metrics and performance benchmarks

**Result:** The D3PM model achieved a BPT of 5.72 and a processing speed of 3.97 batches per second, while the AR model had a lower mean BPT of 4.59 but outperformed in compression.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the evaluation of a single diffusion model and requires further exploration of additional architectures for comprehensive insights.

**Conclusion:** The findings present a comparative analysis of diffusion models versus autoregressive models and indicate both the potential and limitations of diffusion for discrete generation tasks, suggesting directions for future research.

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution, followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation. Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.   Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of 4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the vulnerability of text classifiers to single-word adversarial perturbations, introducing metrics and methodologies to assess and defend against this weakness.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the significant weaknesses in classifiers due to the vulnerability to single-word perturbations that can be exploited by malicious users.

**Method:** The paper introduces a novel metric to assess classifier robustness against single-word perturbations, presents the SP-Attack to generate adversarial examples effectively, and proposes SP-Defense for improving robustness through data augmentation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A novel metric for assessing robustness against single-word perturbations.
	2. The introduction of SP-Attack for generating adversarial examples efficiently.
	3. The development of SP-Defense to enhance classifier robustness via data augmentation.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that SP-Defense improves robustness metrics and significantly decreases the attack success rate of both SP-Attack and other existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed SP-Attack and SP-Defense contribute to better understanding and countering adversarial attacks in text classification systems.

**Abstract:** In text classification, creating an adversarial example means subtly perturbing a few words in a sentence without changing its meaning, causing it to be misclassified by a classifier. A concerning observation is that a significant portion of adversarial examples generated by existing methods change only one word. This single-word perturbation vulnerability represents a significant weakness in classifiers, which malicious users can exploit to efficiently create a multitude of adversarial examples. This paper studies this problem and makes the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a novel metric \r{ho} to quantitatively assess a classifier's robustness against single-word perturbation. (2) We present the SP-Attack, designed to exploit the single-word perturbation vulnerability, achieving a higher attack success rate, better preserving sentence meaning, while reducing computation costs compared to state-of-the-art adversarial methods. (3) We propose SP-Defense, which aims to improve \r{ho} by applying data augmentation in learning. Experimental results on 4 datasets and BERT and distilBERT classifiers show that SP-Defense improves \r{ho} by 14.6% and 13.9% and decreases the attack success rate of SP-Attack by 30.4% and 21.2% on two classifiers respectively, and decreases the attack success rate of existing attack methods that involve multiple-word perturbations.

In this survey, we review the key tasks of these systems and highlight the associated challenges. Based on the challenges, we summarize their methods from model architecture, model training, and data perspectives. We also conduct performance comparison among the methods, and discuss promising directions for future research.

**Keywords:** Reward Models, Large Language Models, Multi-armed Bandit, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards) improves LLM training by dynamically selecting reward models (RMs) for various tasks, resulting in higher accuracy and efficiency.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the limitations of using a single reward model for training large language models, highlighting the need for a strategy that efficiently selects the most suitable RM for different tasks.

**Method:** LASeR formulates the task of RM selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, allowing iterative training of LLMs with optimal RM choice for each instance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel framework for RM selection using a multi-armed bandit approach
	2. Demonstrates improved LLM training efficiency and accuracy over traditional RM ensemble methods
	3. Achieves superior performance in both commonsense reasoning and math tasks.

**Result:** LASeR improves the accuracy of Llama-3-8B by 2.67% across commonsense and math reasoning tasks, achieves a 72.69% win rate on WildChat, and enhances performance on long-context generation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By adaptively selecting the best RM, LASeR not only boosts accuracy but also significantly speeds up LLM training, demonstrating its effectiveness in various tasks.

**Abstract:** Reward Models (RMs) are crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the degree to which an RM specialized to one task (e.g. writing) generalizes to new tasks (e.g. math) is often not known a priori, often making using only one fixed RM to train LLMs suboptimal. However, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs simultaneously can incur a prohibitively high computational cost and lead to conflicting signals from different RMs that may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards), which frames reward model selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, efficiently and iteratively training LLMs using multiple RMs by selecting the most well-suited RM for each instance. On commonsense and math reasoning tasks, we show that LASeR boosts iterative LLM training, improving the absolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over an ensemble of RM scores while also showing superior efficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat (open-ended instruction-following tasks), LASeR leads to a 72.69% AlpacaEval win rate over the RM score ensemble baseline. Extending to long-context generation, LASeR improves by 2.96 F1 points (avg.) on single-document QA tasks and 2.97 F1 points on few-shot learning over the RM score ensemble baseline with best-of-n sampling.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address computation and latency challenges in LLMs, particularly in constrained environments like mobile and edge devices, which are exacerbated by existing layer skipping strategies.

**Method:** FiRST uses layer-specific routers to dynamically choose which transformer layers to skip during inference, based on the input prompt, while remaining compatible with KV caching.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FiRST for adaptive layer skipping in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of input-specific layer importance
	3. Compatibility with KV caching for improved inference speed

**Result:** FiRST significantly reduces latency and outperforms existing layer selection methods in quality metrics, occasionally even improving upon the base model's performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** FiRST presents an efficient and model-agnostic solution for improving LLM inference in low-resource environments, demonstrating the importance of input adaptivity.

**Abstract:** Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper presents CHAI, a framework for enhancing multilingual LLMs' abilities in code-mixed language understanding, resulting in significant performance gains in translation tasks.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the proven capabilities of LLMs, their effectiveness in handling code-mixed languages is lacking, prompting the need for improvement methods.

**Method:** The CHAI framework utilizes LLMs to generate annotations and preference data for code-mixed translation tasks, followed by a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) approach for model enhancement.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CHAI framework
	2. Use of LLMs for annotation generation
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvement in code-mixed tasks

**Result:** CHAI-powered LLMs achieved a 25.66% improvement in performance over state-of-the-art models on code-mixed translation tasks, based on expert adjudication.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The development of CHAI is a pioneering effort towards creating more effective multilingual LLMs for inclusive code-mixed language applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language understanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to create a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs through summary expansion, providing structured evaluation metrics.

**Method:** The method includes the design of the LCFO benchmark, featuring long documents paired with multiple summaries and QA elements, along with human evaluation and LLM performance analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LCFO benchmark for diverse summary evaluation
	2. Human evaluation scores alongside state-of-the-art LLM results
	3. Insights into the correlation between automatic metrics and human evaluations

**Result:** GPT-4o-mini outperforms other models and humans in some summarization tasks, marking advancements in automatic summarization metrics.

**Limitations:** Automatic metrics show low correlations with human scores, indicating limited reliability in evaluation of summarization quality.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that automatic metrics correlate poorly with human evaluations, highlighting challenges in effectively measuring summarization quality.

**Abstract:** This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6).

**TL;DR:** The paper explores neuron-level distinctions in Large Language Models (LLMs) between memorization and generalization, identifying specific neuron subsets and demonstrating interventions can influence behaviors at inference time.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how LLMs differentiate between memorization and generalization at the neuron level, and to control these behaviors during inference.

**Method:** The study involved experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA-3.2 models, using designed tasks to identify neuron subsets linked to memorization and generalization, followed by interventions at inference time to steer model behavior.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of neuron subsets linked to memorization and generalization
	2. Demonstration of inference-time interventions on neuron behavior
	3. Confirmation of generalizable neuron-behavior associations across tasks

**Result:** We found distinct neuron subsets responsible for memorization and generalization, with interventions steering model behavior consistently. Evaluations confirmed neuron-behavior associations are generalizable across tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Our findings reveal a modular structure in LLMs, enabling control over memorization and generalization behaviors during inference.

**Abstract:** We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) distinguish between memorization and generalization at the neuron level. Through carefully designed tasks, we identify distinct neuron subsets responsible for each behavior. Experiments on both a GPT-2 model trained from scratch and a pretrained LLaMA-3.2 model fine-tuned with LoRA show consistent neuron-level specialization. We further demonstrate that inference-time interventions on these neurons can steer the model's behavior toward memorization or generalization. To assess robustness, we evaluate intra-task and inter-task consistency, confirming that these neuron-behavior associations reflect generalizable patterns rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Our findings reveal modular structure in LLMs and enable controlling memorization and generalization behaviors at inference time.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the interpretability and usability of table summarization for LLMs in administrative contexts, specifically for Korean documents.

**Method:** A multi-step reasoning process combined with a journalist persona prompting strategy, outputting summaries in a structured format with a Theme Part and an Explanation Part.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a novel Tabular-TX pipeline for table summarization.
	2. Introduced a structured output format (Theme Part and Explanation Part).
	3. Utilized in-context learning to minimize reliance on labeled data and resources.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that Tabular-TX effectively processes complex table structures and generates clear, human-friendly summaries.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Tabular-TX offers a robust solution to table summarization in low-resource settings, enhancing the clarity of information conveyed through tables.

**Abstract:** Tables are a primary medium for conveying critical information in administrative domains, yet their complexity hinders utilization by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces the Theme-Explanation Structure-based Table Summarization (Tabular-TX) pipeline, a novel approach designed to generate highly interpretable summaries from tabular data, with a specific focus on Korean administrative documents. Current table summarization methods often neglect the crucial aspect of human-friendly output. Tabular-TX addresses this by first employing a multi-step reasoning process to ensure deep table comprehension by LLMs, followed by a journalist persona prompting strategy for clear sentence generation. Crucially, it then structures the output into a Theme Part (an adverbial phrase) and an Explanation Part (a predicative clause), significantly enhancing readability. Our approach leverages in-context learning, obviating the need for extensive fine-tuning and associated labeled data or computational resources. Experimental results show that Tabular-TX effectively processes complex table structures and metadata, offering a robust and efficient solution for generating human-centric table summaries, especially in low-resource scenarios.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in extracting relevant information from long contexts, addressing the weaknesses of existing benchmarks like the needle-in-a-haystack test.

**Method:** NoLiMa benchmark utilizes a needle set designed with minimal lexical overlap to evaluate the performance of LLMs when identifying relevant information in lengthy contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NoLiMa benchmark for LLM evaluation
	2. Analysis of model performance decline with longer contexts
	3. Public release of dataset and evaluation code

**Result:** Evaluation of 13 popular LLMs revealed a significant drop in performance as context length increased, highlighting challenges in attention mechanisms under minimal lexical overlap conditions.

**Limitations:** The results indicate limitations in LLMs' performance in real-world applications where long context retrieval is critical.

**Conclusion:** Models struggle to maintain retrieval accuracy in longer contexts, even when enhanced with reasoning techniques. The dataset and code will be publicly accessible for further research.

**Abstract:** Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 13 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 11 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information. Even models enhanced with reasoning capabilities or CoT prompting struggle to maintain performance in long contexts. We publicly release the dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/adobe-research/NoLiMa.

**Motivation:** Existing methods for mathematical reasoning with LLMs have limitations in their adaptability and reliance on predefined strategies.

**Method:** TATA integrates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning to personalize reasoning strategies for LLMs based on their intrinsic aptitude.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the TATA framework for adaptive reasoning in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of improved performance in mathematical reasoning tasks
	3. Empirical validation of the importance of aptitude-aware data selection.

**Result:** TATA was evaluated on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, showing improved performance and efficiency by effectively combining Chain-of-Thought and Tool-Integrated Reasoning approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that aptitude-aware data selection is crucial for LLMs to autonomously determine and apply suitable reasoning strategies, leading to better performance.

**Abstract:** Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation. While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of MAT-Steer, a novel framework for targeted steering of LLM behaviors across multiple attributes without costly parameter updates.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current ITI methods struggle with multi-attribute conflicts in LLM behavior, needing a solution that can balance difficult trade-offs like helpfulness and toxicity.

**Method:** MAT-Steer employs selective token-level interventions using steering vectors optimized for sparsity and orthogonality to manage multiple attributes effectively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of MAT-Steer for selective interventions
	2. Optimization of steering vectors for multi-attribute balance
	3. Empirical validation on QA and generative tasks

**Result:** MAT-Steer achieves significant performance gains, showing a 3% average accuracy increase across QA tasks and a 55.82% win rate against the best existing ITI approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MAT-Steer demonstrates the potential for effective multi-attribute steering in LLMs, paving the way for safer and more useful AI applications.

**Abstract:** Inference-time intervention (ITI) has emerged as a promising method for steering large language model (LLM) behavior in a particular direction (e.g., improving helpfulness) by intervening on token representations without costly updates to the LLM's parameters. However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. MAT-Steer learns steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model's internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we balance attributes like truthfulness, bias, and toxicity; (ii) on generative tasks where we simultaneously improve attributes like helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. MAT-Steer outperforms existing ITI and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches across both task types (e.g., 3% average accuracy gain across QA tasks and 55.82% win rate against the best ITI baseline).

**Motivation:** Existing recommendation systems mainly rely on purchase histories and often overlook user-generated textual data, limiting their effectiveness.

**Method:** PURE utilizes three components: a Review Extractor for extracting user preferences, a Profile Updater for maintaining user profiles, and a Recommender for providing personalized recommendations based on updated profiles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a framework that combines LLMs with user-generated data for recommendations
	2. Development of a continuous sequential recommendation task for evaluation
	3. Demonstrated superior performance on Amazon datasets compared to existing methods

**Result:** Experimental results show that PURE outperforms current LLM-based recommendation systems by effectively leveraging long-term user information and adapting to new data over time.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on Amazon datasets, which may limit generalizability to other platforms or domains.

**Conclusion:** PURE presents significant improvements in the recommendation process by integrating evolving user reviews, demonstrating its strength in real-world applications through continuous updating of user profiles.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in recommender systems by enabling zero-shot recommendation without conventional training. Despite their potential, most existing works rely solely on users' purchase histories, leaving significant room for improvement by incorporating user-generated textual data, such as reviews and product descriptions. Addressing this gap, we propose PURE, a novel LLM-based recommendation framework that builds and maintains evolving user profiles by systematically extracting and summarizing key information from user reviews. PURE consists of three core components: a Review Extractor for identifying user preferences and key product features, a Profile Updater for refining and updating user profiles, and a Recommender for generating personalized recommendations using the most current profile. To evaluate PURE, we introduce a continuous sequential recommendation task that reflects real-world scenarios by adding reviews over time and updating predictions incrementally. Our experimental results on Amazon datasets demonstrate that PURE outperforms existing LLM-based methods, effectively leveraging long-term user information while managing token limitations.

**Conclusion:** A nuanced evaluation paradigm can enhance both the effectiveness of jailbreak methods and the reliability of assessments.

**Abstract:** Despite the growing interest in jailbreak methods as an effective red-teaming tool for building safe and responsible large language models (LLMs), flawed evaluation system designs have led to significant discrepancies in their effectiveness assessments. We conduct a systematic measurement study based on 37 jailbreak studies since 2022, focusing on both the methods and the evaluation systems they employ. We find that existing evaluation systems lack case-specific criteria, resulting in misleading conclusions about their effectiveness and safety implications. This paper advocates a shift to a more nuanced, case-by-case evaluation paradigm. We introduce GuidedBench, a novel benchmark comprising a curated harmful question dataset, detailed case-by-case evaluation guidelines and an evaluation system integrated with these guidelines -- GuidedEval. Experiments demonstrate that GuidedBench offers more accurate measurements of jailbreak performance, enabling meaningful comparisons across methods and uncovering new insights overlooked in previous evaluations. GuidedEval reduces inter-evaluator variance by at least 76.03\%. Furthermore, we observe that incorporating guidelines can enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak methods themselves, offering new insights into both attack strategies and evaluation paradigms.

**Result:** TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across various models and architectures, resulting in considerable time savings for ultra-long sequence generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TOKENSWIFT is a scalable and effective solution for accelerating ultra-long sequence generation while maintaining model quality.

**Abstract:** Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths.

**Result:** Users prioritize core functionalities over stylistic components, and there is a significant misalignment between user feedback and expert evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study offers insights into the design and evaluation of conversational coaching agents, aiming to enhance human-centered NLP applications.

**Abstract:** While NLP research has made strides in conversational tasks, many approaches focus on single-turn responses with well-defined objectives or evaluation criteria. In contrast, coaching presents unique challenges with initially undefined goals that evolve through multi-turn interactions, subjective evaluation criteria, mixed-initiative dialogue. In this work, we describe and implement five multi-turn coaching agents that exhibit distinct conversational styles, and evaluate them through a user study, collecting first-person feedback on 155 conversations. We find that users highly value core functionality, and that stylistic components in absence of core components are viewed negatively. By comparing user feedback with third-person evaluations from health experts and an LM, we reveal significant misalignment across evaluation approaches. Our findings provide insights into design and evaluation of conversational coaching agents and contribute toward improving human-centered NLP applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to reduce uncertainty about latent entities in various applications, such as education or healthcare, and the limitations of existing LLM fine-tuning methods in strategic information gathering.

**Method:** The framework employs a meta-learned language model to predict future observations, enabling scalable uncertainty quantification and developing sophisticated querying strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an adaptive elicitation framework leveraging LLMs
	2. Implementation of autoregressive forward simulation for uncertainty quantification
	3. Empirical validation showing improvement over baseline approaches

**Result:** The proposed model outperforms baseline methods in identifying critical unknowns and improving predictions across several experimental scenarios, including the 20 questions game and adaptive student assessment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that strategic information gathering can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs in natural language processing tasks.

**Abstract:** Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about a latent entity is a critical task in many application domains, e.g., assessing individual student learning outcomes, diagnosing underlying diseases, or learning user preferences. Though natural language is a powerful medium for this purpose, large language models (LLMs) and existing fine-tuning algorithms lack mechanisms for strategically gathering information to refine their own understanding of the latent entity. To harness the generalization power and world knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering strategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces uncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract latent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of uncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future observations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex natural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model quantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the development of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the most informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic opinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently outperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream predictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in natural language settings.

**Read time:** 16 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of transformer-based LLMs that generate context-dependent representations for tokens, which do not fully capture the multiple meanings or senses that words can embody.

**Method:** The authors apply a clustering algorithm to LLM-generated embeddings to create a sense embedding dictionary, representing the various senses of tokens. They also propose a knowledge distillation technique to train a smaller student model using this sense dictionary.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of multi-sense embeddings as a drop-in replacement for LLMs.
	2. Development of a knowledge distillation method leveraging sense embeddings.
	3. Demonstration of improved efficiency and performance on benchmark datasets.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that the multi-sense embeddings and the knowledge distillation method yield significant improvements in efficiency without compromising performance on various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The approach may be limited by the clustering algorithm's ability to accurately represent all meanings of tokens and may require extensive tuning to achieve optimal results across various contexts.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach effectively reduces space and inference time while maintaining competitive results, showcasing the potential of multi-sense embeddings alongside knowledge distillation in LLM applications.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely on contextual embeddings which generate different (continuous) representations for the same token depending on its surrounding context. Nonetheless, words and tokens typically have a limited number of senses (or meanings). We propose multi-sense embeddings as a drop-in replacement for each token in order to capture the range of their uses in a language. To construct a sense embedding dictionary, we apply a clustering algorithm to embeddings generated by an LLM and consider the cluster centers as representative sense embeddings. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method that leverages the sense dictionary to learn a smaller student model that mimics the senses from the much larger base LLM model, offering significant space and inference time savings, while maintaining competitive performance. Via thorough experiments on various benchmarks, we showcase the effectiveness of our sense embeddings and knowledge distillation approach.
