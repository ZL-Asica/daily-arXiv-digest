**Conclusion:** Integrating sentiment analysis into LMS can significantly enhance the quality of online education by bridging the communication gap between students and instructors.

**Abstract:** During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection, and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding, LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback. The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how scenario building methods can enhance the field of computer science, especially in relation to emerging technologies like AI, and to identify gaps in the existing use of these methods.

**Method:** A systematic literature review of 59 studies from the past decade that utilize scenario building methods in computer science.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Scenario building methods are valuable tools in computer science for anticipating future developments and sociotechnical dynamics, with scope for greater inclusivity in research.

**Abstract:** Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions. First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature, focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing scenario building literature in computer science.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Haptics, Human-Machine Interaction, Modular Systems, Personalization, Information Theory

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance human-machine interaction by creating multimodal haptic interfaces that can be personalized based on user preferences and task requirements.

**Method:** The study develops a soft haptic system with modular pneumatic displays equipped with fluidic logic circuits to facilitate hardware reconfiguration without code alterations, optimizing signal types to improve information transfer based on user sensitivity and preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a customizable haptic system with modular hardware
	2. Information-theoretic approach for feedback personalization
	3. Framework evaluation through user studies showing enhanced multimodal interactions

**Result:** User studies demonstrate that the modular and personalized approach significantly enhances the effectiveness of haptic feedback, supporting better interaction outcomes in dynamic environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that integrating modularity and personalization can substantially improve the efficacy of haptic interfaces, paving the way for their application in adaptive human-machine interactions.

**Abstract:** We present a customizable soft haptic system that integrates modular hardware with an information-theoretic algorithm to personalize feedback for different users and tasks. Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom pneumatic displays, where different signal types, such as pressure, frequency, and contact area, can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits. These circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics and enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a compact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic signal rendering through hardware-level logic switching without rewriting code. Personalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of modular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which display configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as a signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to the user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware setup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and the user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in sensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework through user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays under different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of modularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and advance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in dynamic human-machine interaction contexts.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI, Harm, Reparation, Responsible AI, Justice

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper develops a taxonomy of AI harm reparation, analyzing incidents to improve accountability and reparative approaches in Responsible AI.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the effects of AI harm and explore what constitutes reparation, who initiates it, and its effectiveness following AI-related harms.

**Method:** A thematic analysis of 1,060 real-world AI incidents, organizing reparative actions into four overarching goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing remedies, and enabling systemic change.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a taxonomy of AI harm reparation
	2. Empirical analysis of 1,060 AI-related incidents
	3. Identification of gaps in accountability and structural reform in reparation efforts

**Result:** Reparation efforts are found to be mostly concentrated in early, symbolic stages, with a lack of accountability or structural reform actions.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on existing incidents, which may not fully represent all aspects of AI harm and reparation.

**Conclusion:** The existing reparation responses in the realm of AI harm are inadequate for delivering meaningful redress, indicating the need for more accountable approaches in Responsible AI.

**Abstract:** As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are integrated into more aspects of society, they offer new capabilities but also cause a range of harms that are drawing increasing scrutiny. A large body of work in the Responsible AI community has focused on identifying and auditing these harms. However, much less is understood about what happens after harm occurs: what constitutes reparation, who initiates it, and how effective these reparations are. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy of AI harm reparation based on a thematic analysis of real-world incidents. The taxonomy organizes reparative actions into four overarching goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing remedies, and enabling systemic change. We apply this framework to a dataset of 1,060 AI-related incidents, analyzing the prevalence of each action and the distribution of stakeholder involvement. Our findings show that reparation efforts are concentrated in early, symbolic stages, with limited actions toward accountability or structural reform. Drawing on theories of justice, we argue that existing responses fall short of delivering meaningful redress. This work contributes a foundation for advancing more accountable and reparative approaches to Responsible AI.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Joint Attention, Multimodal Large Language Models, Speech-Language Pathology, Parent-Child Interaction, Behavioral Cues

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper explores using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to evaluate joint attention in parent-child interactions, utilizing insights from speech-language pathologists (SLPs) for improved assessment and guidance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To support caregivers in assessing joint attention, a crucial aspect of child development, which is currently challenging without expert intervention.

**Method:** Conducted interviews and video studies with SLPs to extract behavioral cues and developed a two-stage MLLM-based system for analyzing interaction videos.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of insights from SLPs with MLLMs for behavior assessment
	2. Proposed design guidelines for MLLM-based systems
	3. Demonstrated feasibility of MLLM systems in supporting developmental assessments

**Result:** The system achieved up to 85% accuracy in extracting behavioral cues and over 75% in simulating expert judgment in a study with 26 videos.

**Limitations:** Work in progress; system may require further validation and refinement.

**Conclusion:** MLLMs can effectively support the evaluation of joint attention and provide guidelines for creating better observational tools for SLPs.

**Abstract:** Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.

**Keywords:** gaze data, data quality, privacy, human-computer interaction, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** QualitEye is a method for verifying the quality of image-based gaze data, addressing challenges of data quality and privacy in collaborative settings.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growing accessibility of large datasets for gaze-based applications, along with challenges in data quality and privacy during collection, necessitates a reliable verification method.

**Method:** QualitEye introduces a new semantic representation of eye images to facilitate data verification while maintaining privacy through adapted private set intersection protocols.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First method for the verification of gaze data quality
	2. Semantic representation of eye images for enhanced verification
	3. Adapted private set intersection protocols for privacy preservation

**Result:** QualitEye demonstrates high verification performance on MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets, with minimal runtime overhead for privacy-preserving implementations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The method establishes a foundation for advanced gaze analysis techniques combining machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

**Abstract:** Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate, therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic representation of eye images that contains the information required for verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

**Conclusion:** HCI is positioned to lead discussions on evolving ethical practices through its history of practice-oriented research.

**Abstract:** As emerging technologies continue to shape society, there is a growing emphasis on the need to engage with design ethics as it unfolds in practice to better capture the complexities of ethical considerations embedded in day-to-day work. Positioned within the broader "turn to practice" in HCI, the review characterizes this body of work in terms of its motivations, conceptual frameworks, methodologies, and contributions across a range of design disciplines and academic databases. The findings reveal a shift away from static and abstract ethical frameworks toward an understanding of ethics as an evolving, situated, and inherent aspect of design activities, one that can be cultivated and fostered collaboratively. This review proposes six future directions for establishing common research priorities and fostering the field's growth. While the review promotes cross-disciplinary dialogue, we argue that HCI research, given its cumulative experience with practice-oriented research, is well-equipped to guide this emerging strand of work on design ethics.

**Keywords:** Mixed Reality, Parametric Modeling, Conversational Interface, Large Language Model, Design Interaction

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a conversational mixed reality interface that enhances parametric modeling through speech and gesture inputs, supported by a multi-agent LLM system to facilitate intuitive design processes.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing mixed reality tools in supporting parametric modeling for designers, particularly those without programming backgrounds.

**Method:** The proposed system integrates speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent LLM to dynamically manage parameters and assist in real-time model manipulation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel conversational MR interface for design modeling
	2. Integration of speech, gesture, and LLM functionalities
	3. Reduction of barriers in parametric modeling for non-programmers

**Result:** The system reduces cognitive and operational barriers for users during early-stage design tasks, allowing for improved exploration and refinement of design spaces.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address the scalability of the system for larger design projects or the performance of the LLM in specialized design contexts.

**Conclusion:** The research expands the capabilities of mixed reality as a generative design platform, enabling natural interaction in parametric design.

**Abstract:** Mixed reality (MR) environments offer embodied spatial interaction, providing intuitive 3D manipulation capabilities that enhance the conceptual design process. Parametric modeling, a powerful and advanced architectural design method, enables the generation of complex, optimized geometries. However, its integration into MR environments remains limited due to precision constraints and unsuitable input modalities. Existing MR tools prioritize spatial interaction but lack the control and expressiveness required for parametric workflows, particularly for designers without formal programming backgrounds. We address this gap by introducing a novel conversational MR interface that combines speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system to support intuitive parametric modeling. Our system dynamically manages parameter states, resolves ambiguous commands through conversation and contextual prompting, and enables real-time model manipulation within immersive environments. We demonstrate how this approach reduces cognitive and operational barriers in early-stage design tasks, allowing users to refine and explore their design space. This work expands the role of MR to a generative design platform, supporting programmatic thinking in design tasks through natural, embodied interaction.

**Read time:** 24 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the challenge of analyzing large qualitative datasets using traditional methods that are labor-intensive and impractical due to scalability issues.

**Method:** The authors propose a 'human-in-the-loop' methodology that combines conventional Grounded Theory with computational methods to maintain control and enhance credibility in the results.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Computational Grounded Theory framework
	2. Integration of ML and NLP techniques into qualitative analysis
	3. Emphasis on a 'human-in-the-loop' approach for credibility

**Result:** The proposed framework was applied to a dataset from Reddit, examining tutors' experiences in the gig economy, showing the effectiveness of CGT in large qualitative datasets.

**Limitations:** The paper may not address the specific computational needs of all qualitative research queries or the variability of ML/NLP tool effectiveness across different contexts.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that CGT offers a robust method for qualitative analysis by utilizing computational tools while ensuring researcher oversight and methodological validity.

**Abstract:** The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop' methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors' experiences in the gig economy.

	2. Expands the range of applications for executable QR codes.
	3. Addresses limitations of QR code payload capacity.

**Result:** The proposed method allows for longer and more complex programs to be included in executable QR codes, increasing their utility in various fields.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the method in different contexts and scalability are not fully tested.

**Conclusion:** By optimizing string occupancy, the method enables enhanced functionalities for sQRy, potentially impacting both industrial and non-industrial applications.

**Abstract:** Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics, and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data. However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.

**Result:** A usability study demonstrated excellent usability and favorable perceptions of the app, highlighting its effective assistance in wound management for elderly patients.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** WoundAIssist effectively bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers through AI technology, providing valuable insights for designing similar healthcare applications.

**Abstract:** The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations, presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations, elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital health tools across clinical domains.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of trust and social presence in utilizing AI characters for effective collaborative learning environments.

**Abstract:** While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment (SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence, and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence in creating a collaborative context.   This paper was accepted as an full paper for AIED 2025.

**Conclusion:** While Litti offered a positive learning experience, it did not significantly improve trust or safety perceptions concerning generative AI among older adults.

**Abstract:** As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks. Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI. This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

**Conclusion:** HILAD fosters bidirectional communication between humans and AI, improving the effectiveness of anomaly detection and user engagement.

**Abstract:** Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performing models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across the dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation through user studies with two models and three time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD, which fosters a deeper model understanding, immediate corrective actions, and model reliability enhancement.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for a non-contact and privacy-preserving method for accurate 3D hand pose reconstruction in human-computer interactions.

**Method:** A physics-inspired neural network is proposed to learn 3D spatial representations and the 3D pose reconstruction is formulated as a retrieval task. Additionally, a heterogeneous knowledge distillation method is introduced for efficient deployment on IoT devices.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a non-contact, privacy-preserving hand pose reconstruction system using thermal sensors.
	2. Novel physics-inspired neural network for learning 3D representations from low-resolution thermal data.
	3. Effective knowledge distillation method for implementation on IoT devices.

**Result:** TAPOR demonstrates remarkable performance in real-world scenarios and achieves a computation reduction of 377x, validated through gesture control and finger tracking case studies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TAPOR is positioned as a ubiquitous interface for around-device control, and the implementation is available as open-source software.

**Abstract:** This paper presents the design and implementation of TAPOR, a privacy-preserving, non-contact, and fully passive sensing system for accurate and robust 3D hand pose reconstruction for around-device interaction using a single low-cost thermal array sensor. Thermal sensing using inexpensive and miniature thermal arrays emerges with an excellent utility-privacy balance, offering an imaging resolution significantly lower than cameras but far superior to RF signals like radar or WiFi. The design of TAPOR, however, is challenging, mainly because the captured temperature maps are low-resolution and textureless. To overcome the challenges, we investigate thermo-depth and thermo-pose properties, proposing a novel physics-inspired neural network that learns effective 3D spatial representations of potential hand poses. We then formulate the 3D pose reconstruction problem as a distinct retrieval task, enabling accurate hand pose determination from the input temperature map. To deploy TAPOR on IoT devices, we introduce an effective heterogeneous knowledge distillation method, reducing computation by 377x. TAPOR is fully implemented and tested in real-world scenarios, showing remarkable performance, supported by four gesture control and finger tracking case studies. We envision TAPOR to be a ubiquitous interface for around-device control and have open-sourced it at https://github.com/aiot-lab/TAPOR.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** semantic role labeling, large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, self-correction, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses the gap in semantic role labeling (SRL) performance between large language models (LLMs) and state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models by introducing mechanisms for retrieval-augmented generation and self-correction.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of generative decoder-based LLMs in semantic role labeling, an area where they have been surpassed by encoder-decoder models.

**Method:** The authors propose two mechanisms: retrieval-augmented generation, which helps LLMs use external linguistic knowledge, and self-correction, which allows LLMs to revise their SRL outputs for consistency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of retrieval-augmented generation for LLMs in SRL.
	2. Development of a self-correction mechanism for inconsistent SRL outputs.
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance in SRL for both Chinese and English.

**Result:** The methodology was tested on three benchmarks (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012), and results showed that the proposed approach outperformed encoder-decoder models, achieving state-of-the-art results in both Chinese and English SRL tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work signifies the first successful application of LLMs to surpass traditional encoder-decoder methods in the task of semantic role labeling.

**Abstract:** Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing (NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a) retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the generation of long-form clinical notes from sparse patient information using reinforcement learning and semantic guidance.

**Method:** R2AG utilizes reinforcement learning to retrieve reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, enhancing the LLM's output for clinical discharge instructions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of R2AG, the first reinforced retriever for long-form clinical note generation.
	2. Implementation of Group-Based Retriever Optimization (GRO) to enhance information retrieval.
	3. Demonstration of improved clinical text generation metrics and reduced misinterpretation in LLM outputs.

**Result:** R2AG demonstrates superior performance over baseline methods in clinical efficacy and natural language generation on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The R2AG method successfully fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios and improves the accuracy of clinical text generation by guiding LLMs with retrieved reasoning paths.

**Abstract:** Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being a representative long-form example. While recent large language model (LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the necessity for specialized detection and mitigation strategies addressing unique dimensions of gender bias in e-commerce LLM applications.

**Abstract:** While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique, under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks: exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for the context of e-commerce.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TGTalker not only enhances prediction accuracy but also contributes to explainability in temporal link prediction by generating textual explanations for each prediction.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs -- real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information, converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction.

**Conclusion:** Auto Review successfully automates the manual verification process while maintaining high accuracy, despite challenges posed by ASR performance and domain-specific jargon.

**Abstract:** Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

	1. Introduction of AsymKV framework for key-value cache compression
	2. Demonstration of key-value asymmetry in existing methods
	3. Empirical evidence showing AsymKV's superiority over state-of-the-art methods

**Result:** AsymKV significantly outperforms existing long-context methods, achieving an average score of 43.95 on LongBench with LLaMA3.1-8B, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The novel AsymKV framework addresses limitations in current compression methods and enhances efficiency in long-context applications.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

**TL;DR:** This study uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze narrative samples from children to identify language development trajectories related to Specific Language Impairment (SLI).

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve early identification and intervention strategies for Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in children, moving beyond traditional assessment methods that may miss subtle developmental patterns.

**Method:** The study employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques on narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years, evaluating 64 linguistic features.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze language development in children with SLI.
	2. Identified distinct linguistic profiles that challenge traditional categorical frameworks for SLI diagnosis.
	3. Provided insights for better-targeted interventions based on developmental trajectories.

**Result:** Two main clusters were identified: one with high language production and low SLI prevalence, and another with limited production but higher syntactic complexity and higher SLI prevalence.

**Limitations:** Results may not fully capture all linguistic characteristics of SLI due to reliance on narrative samples. Further research needed for a broader understanding.

**Conclusion:** SLI is primarily characterized by reduced production capacity rather than syntactic complexity deficits, suggesting a continuum of language abilities and the need for refined diagnostic criteria.

**Abstract:** Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities. Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the accuracy of answers generated by LLMs through interpretable machine learning techniques while addressing safety concerns.

**Method:** The proposed method generates a ruleset from defined knowledge patterns, converts rules into text via a rule-to-text converter, and integrates this into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a method that integrates enhanced association rules with LLMs via RAG.
	2. Demonstrated significant improvements in answer quality compared to existing LLMs like ChatGPT.
	3. Outlined future research directions for further improvements in the method.

**Result:** The new method outperformed ChatGPT and other approaches in answering questions based on datasets, showcasing significant improvements.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on LLMs and may have limitations in terms of the general applicability of the method across different AI models.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate potential for further enhancements, including the integration of additional patterns and rule mining techniques.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted, like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG. Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an agent, and many others.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a two-step system for clinical question answering utilizing EHR data.
	2. Demonstration that smaller models can outperform larger models in specific tasks.
	3. Emphasis on the critical role of accurate sentence selection in generating high-quality responses.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Enhancing the reliability of sentence classification through self-consistency and thresholding is crucial for improving response quality in clinical settings.

**Abstract:** We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency, and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding helps make these decisions more reliable.

**TL;DR:** Introducing SynthesizeMe, a method for creating synthetic user personas from interactions to enhance personalized reward modeling for LLMs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address limitations in prior personalized reward models that rely on identity information by developing a method that generates synthetic user personas from user interactions.

**Method:** SynthesizeMe generates explanations for user preferences, induces synthetic personas from these explanations, and filters user interactions to create personalized prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a method to create synthetic user personas from interaction data.
	2. Demonstrates improved accuracy in LLM performance on user preference tasks.
	3. Establishes a new benchmark (PersonalRewardBench) for evaluating personalized LLM tasks.

**Result:** Using SynthesizeMe prompted interactions increased the personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena; achieved top performance on PersonalRewardBench.

**Limitations:** The method's effectiveness may vary based on the diversity of user interactions and the quality of generated reasoning.

**Conclusion:** SynthesizeMe provides a viable approach to personalized reward modeling without needing demographic identity information, enhancing LLM interactions.

**Abstract:** Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information, such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

**Result:** OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures various aspects of user behavior, establishing a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in predicting user actions and rationales.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The OPERA dataset provides foundational support for future research on LLM agents as personalized digital twins of humans.

**Abstract:** Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

**Motivation:** To detect linguistic anomalies in patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease screening, with a focus on the impact of gender confounding.

**Method:** The study proposes two methods, the Extended Confounding Filter and the Dual Filter, to isolate and ablate weights related to gender in transformer models used for dementia detection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed methods to address gender confounding in dementia detection.
	2. Evaluation demonstrating the impact of gender on transformer model performance in detecting Alzheimer's disease.
	3. Insights into model overfitting related to training data distributions.

**Result:** Evaluation on dementia datasets shows that while the proposed methods effectively disrupt gender-related weights, they lead to slightly reduced performance in dementia detection.

**Limitations:** Slight reduction in dementia detection performance when gender-related weights are disrupted.

**Conclusion:** The methods successfully produce a deconfounded dementia classifier but at the cost of a minor performance trade-off in detection efficacy.

**Abstract:** Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection performance.

**Motivation:** To better understand how language models memorize facts compared to verbatim sequences, thereby aiding in effective model training and evaluation.

**Method:** The authors propose a novel dataset consisting of synthetic webtext-like documents and associated question-answer pairs, conducting training experiments to analyze different forms of memorization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a new dataset for studying dual memorization processes in language models.
	2. Empirical analysis showing the efficacy of synthetic data for training language models.
	3. Identification of challenges in creating realistic fictional synthetic data.

**Result:** The experiments demonstrate that synthetic data about fictional events is effective in differentiating between fact memorization and verbatim sequence memorization.

**Limitations:** The paper primarily focuses on synthetic data and its memorization properties, which may not generalize to real-world data.

**Conclusion:** Building realistic fictional synthetic data poses challenges, but is essential for more nuanced studies of memory in language models.

**Abstract:** When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world. At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

**Abstract:** As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to address the challenge of accurately simulating user actions with LLMs, for which high-quality datasets capturing user behavior and reasoning are scarce.

**Method:** The authors developed an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to collect the OPERA dataset, which encompasses user personas, browser observations, web actions, and self-reported rationales during online shopping sessions.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of OPERA lays the foundational work for the future research of LLM agents that can act as personalized digital twins of humans.

**Abstract:** Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework for Event Causality Identification that addresses challenges of existing models through Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation, outperforming previous unsupervised approaches in accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing Event Causality Identification (ECI) models depend heavily on large-scale annotated data and can suffer from causal hallucination, which motivates the need for a more robust zero-shot framework.

**Method:** The method involves decomposing causality reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis, and sufficiency verification) and using carefully designed prompts to guide LLMs in generating uncertain and deterministic outputs. Fuzzy aggregation is then used to integrate evidence for causality scoring.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MEFA framework for zero-shot ECI
	2. Decomposition of causality reasoning into specific tasks
	3. Use of fuzzy aggregation for causality determination

**Result:** The MEFA framework outperforms the second-best unsupervised baselines by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while reducing hallucination-induced errors significantly.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** In-depth analysis confirms the effectiveness of task decomposition and the advantages of fuzzy aggregation in improving ECI performance.

**Abstract:** Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links. To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis, and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second, leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

**Abstract:** This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and CG.

**Abstract:** Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks.

To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address challenges in Knowledge Distillation for LLMs, such as catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse during training.

**Method:** A novel curriculum learning framework that ranks training samples from easy to hard and introduces them incrementally into the distillation process, using loss functions with progressively rising temperatures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a curriculum learning framework for KD
	2. Implementation of difficulty measurer and training scheduler
	3. Improvement of distilled model performance in instruction-following tasks

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework improves performance of distilled student models across various white-box KD methods and model families.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The structure of training data is crucial in enhancing the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

**Abstract:** Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model, reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance. However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload" (POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

**Read time:** 10 min

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing methods that serialize relational data into text, leading to loss of relational structure and inefficiencies in LLM processing.

**Method:** A graph neural network-based encoder generates structured relational prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation framework, preserving the inherent relational structure of databases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a graph neural network-based encoder for relational prompts
	2. Preservation of relational structures in database data processing
	3. Demonstrated efficiency and scalability in LLM integration with structured data

**Result:** Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key relational deep learning tasks, providing a scalable and efficient methodology for LLMs to reason over relational data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method enhances the integration of LLMs with structured data sources, making it a valuable contribution to the field of relational deep learning.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL) remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically, the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of unintended memorization in LLMs and the limitations of current unlearning methods that overlook latent dependencies.

**Method:** The proposed framework evaluates unlearning by representing factual contexts as knowledge graphs and employing LLMs to assess unlearning success through an inference-based protocol.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework using knowledge graphs
	2. Inference-based evaluation protocol utilizing LLMs as judges
	3. Public availability of the code for further research

**Result:** The framework demonstrated a more realistic assessment of unlearning performance, revealing that existing evaluation strategies may overestimate the effectiveness of unlearning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The evaluation framework offers a rigorous approach to understanding knowledge unlearning in LLMs, highlighting the complexity of implicit knowledge retention.

**Abstract:** Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework offers a novel perspective on enhancing long-context training for language models, suggesting improvements in adaptive learning strategies.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance. Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore, we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for rethinking long-context training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the BioMol-MQA dataset
	2. Creation of a multimodal knowledge graph encompassing diverse data types
	3. Demonstration of LLM challenges in multi-modality question answering

**Result:** Benchmarks reveal that existing LLMs face difficulties in answering questions without adequate background data, highlighting the limitations of current RAG methods.

**Limitations:** Existing LLMs require significant background information to perform adequately in answering questions.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the need for robust RAG frameworks to effectively handle multimodal information in complex domains such as healthcare.

**Abstract:** Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the time perception abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their decision-making adaptations based on temporal awareness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how LLMs perceive time can enhance their performance in time-sensitive applications, which remains an underexplored area.

**Method:** Three experiments were conducted: validating the Token-Time Hypothesis through a dialogue duration judgment task, assessing response adjustments under urgency, and analyzing behavior in a time-pressured interactive navigation task called BombRush.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Token-Time Hypothesis for LLMs.
	2. Evidence of LLMs adapting responses based on perceived urgency.
	3. Development of BombRush to assess behavior under time pressure.

**Result:** LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous time, adjusting response lengths based on urgency, and modifying behavior under time pressure, though capabilities vary by model size and reasoning skills.

**Limitations:** The capability of perceiving time varies with model size and reasoning abilities, which might limit generalizability across all LLMs.

**Conclusion:** Enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs could significantly benefit applications that require timely responses or actions.

**Abstract:** While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis, positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time, and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning abilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MAPLE demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing table-based question answering by integrating human-like cognitive processes.

**Abstract:** Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE (Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

This enables an accurate assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness: FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o).

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Cross-lingual Collapse, multilingual language models, reasoning, Group-Relative Policy Optimization, language consistency

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper identifies and explores the phenomenon of Cross-lingual Collapse in multilingual language models, where reasoning reverts to the dominant pre-training language despite prompts in different languages.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the mechanisms behind multilingual reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs) and to investigate the systematic drift toward dominant pre-training languages.

**Method:** The authors fine-tuned multilingual LRMs using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on datasets translated into Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian, while monitoring task accuracy and language consistency of reasoning chains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of Cross-lingual Collapse in multilingual LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of how GRPO affects language consistency and accuracy during fine-tuning.
	3. Insights into reward shaping and pre-training impacts on multilingual reasoning capabilities.

**Result:** The experiments uncovered significant issues: pre-training language imbalances erode low-resource languages quickly, applying a language consistency reward can decrease accuracy, and once language collapse occurs, it is largely irreversible with difficulties in restoring original target-language reasoning capabilities.

**Limitations:** The findings suggest that once language collapse occurs, corrective measures in subsequent fine-tuning are ineffective, indicating a potential limitation in the flexibility of multilingual models.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that reasoning capabilities are not equally developed across all languages and underscores the impact of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training factors on multilingual reasoning.

**Abstract:** We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates; (ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

**TL;DR:** R2-Reasoner is a framework that optimizes multi-step reasoning in LLMs by dynamically routing subtasks based on complexity to more suitable models, significantly reducing API costs while maintaining accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs through efficient multi-step reasoning and mitigate the high token usage costs associated with deep reasoning chains.

**Method:** The proposed framework, R2-Reasoner, includes a task decomposer to break complex queries into subtasks and a subtask allocator that matches these tasks to the most appropriate models based on their complexity, trained using a staged reinforcement learning approach.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of R2-Reasoner framework for collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs.
	2. Dynamic routing of subtasks based on complexity for optimized resource allocation.
	3. Significant cost reduction in API usage while maintaining accuracy.

**Result:** R2-Reasoner achieved an 86.85% reduction in API costs in extensive experiments while maintaining or improving baseline accuracy across four benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The R2-Reasoner framework enables effective collaboration across LLMs and SLMs for improved reasoning efficiency and cost-effectiveness in AI applications.

**Abstract:** Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator. The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85% while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R2_Reasoner .

**Motivation:** The rising threat of fake news and misinformation necessitates efficient, scalable solutions for mitigation, which traditional manual fact-checking cannot provide.

**Method:** The proposed framework generates critique feedback that refines the outputs of Large Language Models to ensure factual accuracy by training fine-grained critique models on data from fact-checking sites.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MisMitiFact framework for misinformation mitigation
	2. Development of lightweight critique models trained on fact-checking data
	3. Demonstration of 5x feedback generation throughput improvement.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrated that MisMitiFact's outputs are comparable in quality to responses refined by LLM self-feedback, while achieving a significant increase in feedback generation throughput by approximately 5x.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MisMitiFact offers a cost-effective solution for large-scale misinformation mitigation by combining efficiency with the ability to produce factual, grounded responses.

**Abstract:** Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information. Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale misinformation mitigation.

**Motivation:** To address representation collapse and expert load imbalance in existing homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures, which degrade performance in LLM applications.

**Method:** The paper proposes the heterogeneous Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA) approach, which consists of Soft MoA for weighted fusion of expert outputs and Sparse MoA for selective activation of experts based on their contributions.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The MoA framework enhances the effective transfer of pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks by enabling expert specialization through diverse structural integration.

**Abstract:** Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance, which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach. This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants: \textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA} activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance and parameter efficiency.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of DynamicMind not only improves LLM performance but also offers a more efficient computational framework for handling varying question complexities.

**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind, a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical, commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between performance and computational efficiency.

**Motivation:** Clear intentions in emotional support conversations are crucial to guide both supporters' motivations and the emotional support process effectively.

**Method:** The paper proposes a framework (IntentionESC) defining supporter intentions, emotional states, and appropriate support strategies. It introduces ICECoT to improve LLMs by allowing them to analyze emotions and infer intentions for better support responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition of the IntentionESC framework for emotional support conversations.
	2. Introduction of the ICECoT mechanism for enhancing LLM reasoning.

**Result:** The framework was validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating improved effectiveness in emotional support responses from LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods provide a structured approach to enhance the emotional support capabilities of LLMs, making them more aligned with human thought processes regarding emotional conversations.

**Abstract:** In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation (IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT) mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies, thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a system for generating Math Word Problems (MWPs) using Large Language Models (LLMs) that require minimal input from tutors.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address high failure rates in Math due to students' struggles with problem-solving, this work aims to automate the generation of Math Word Problems.

**Method:** The proposed system uses LLMs to generate MWPs based solely on the number needed, the grade level, and the type of question.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an automated MWP generation system using LLMs
	2. Extensive experimentation with different prompting strategies
	3. Incorporation of human feedback to enhance LLM performance

**Result:** Experimental evaluations show that the generated MWPs maintain high quality with few spelling or grammar errors, though they sometimes fail to meet the specific requirements for grade level and question type.

**Limitations:** LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the specified grade and question type requirements.

**Conclusion:** While the system provides a significant improvement over manual creation and previous LLM approaches, there are limitations in satisfying all user specifications.

**Abstract:** Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed, the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the specified grade and question type requirements.

**TL;DR:** A new inference-time method, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, is proposed to improve Theory of Mind (ToM) in LLMs without degrading generalization.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing inference-time methods for enhancing Theory of Mind in LLMs, which often only focus on specific contexts related to changes in world state.

**Method:** The study introduces Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which begins LLM outputs with a specific phrase to broaden the application of ToM inference across various contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing for ToM enhancement
	2. Demonstration of improved ToM performance across different mental states
	3. Evaluation on both conversational and narrative benchmarks

**Result:** SoO prefixing was tested on two benchmarks for ToM in conversational and narrative scenarios, showing consistent improvements across five categories of mental states.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SoO prefixing method effectively elicits faithful thoughts in LLMs, enhancing their Theory of Mind performance in broader contexts.

**Abstract:** Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models (LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the ToM performance.

Evaluating the effectiveness of text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity. A Python library, code, documentation and tutorials are publicly available.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich, multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs, enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology, history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational domains.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work offers new insights into CoT reasoning mechanisms and presents a framework for efficient CoT deployment.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work, we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient deployment.

**Conclusion:** AvR effectively enhances LLM recursive reasoning capabilities and test-time scaling with significant performance improvements over prior methods.

**Abstract:** The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited, particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0.

**Motivation:** To overcome the challenges in designing high-performing agentic systems that leverage LLMs by addressing inefficiencies in existing search methods and evaluation processes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Hierarchical search space for agentic workflows and functional components

	3. Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search strategy informed by uncertainty

**Result:** Experimental results show an average performance gain of 8.34% over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmarks, along with faster search progress and improvement trajectories.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduced framework enhances the design process for LLM agents by making it more efficient and effective, allowing for improved evaluation and performance optimization.

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement trajectories.

**Motivation:** Address the problem of factual inconsistencies and hallucinations in large language models caused by conflicts between their parametric knowledge and contextual inputs.

**Method:** The proposed method employs a critic and defender in a debate format, where the critic lacks context and evaluates the defender's arguments based on the provided passage. A judge model assesses the outcome of the debate along with the models' confidence to determine the final answer.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Self-Reflective Debate framework for conflict resolution in language models
	2. Demonstrated improvements in reliability against misleading contexts
	3. Maintained accuracy on trustworthy inputs with minimal overhead.

**Result:** Experiments reveal that SR-DCR improves robustness against misleading context while preserving accuracy on valid inputs, surpassing classical debate and confidence-only approaches with low computational costs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SR-DCR effectively enhances contextual reliability in language models by combining debate mechanisms with self-confidence evaluations, offering practical improvements without significant resource demands.

**Abstract:** Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability (SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic, deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence. Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only baselines with minimal computational overhead.

**TL;DR:** Introducing FEEDER, a pre-selection framework for large language models that enhances in-context learning efficiency by selecting a representative subset of demonstrations from training data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To reduce the computational costs associated with existing in-context learning methods that select few-shot demonstrations from large datasets for each query.

**Method:** FEEDER utilizes 'sufficiency' and 'necessity' metrics during the pre-selection stage, along with a tree-based algorithm, to efficiently identify a representative subset of training examples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel pre-selection framework for demonstrations in ICL
	2. Introduction of 'sufficiency' and 'necessity' metrics
	3. Tree-based algorithm for efficient representation selection

**Result:** FEEDER can reduce the training data size by over 20% while maintaining similar performance in in-context learning tasks across various large language models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The use of FEEDER improves training efficiency in both in-context learning and fine-tuning of large language models without compromising performance.

**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end, we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the "sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs, where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from 300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over 20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

**Motivation:** The paper explores the underutilized potential of MLLMs in solving multimodal mathematical theorems and addresses the need for a dedicated benchmark for evaluation.

**Method:** The authors developed MATP-BENCH, consisting of 1056 multimodal theorems from various educational levels, with formalizations in Lean 4, Coq, and Isabelle to facilitate rigorous testing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MATP-BENCH as a benchmark for multimodal automated theorem proving
	2. Inclusion of a diverse set of mathematical problems from various educational levels
	3. Formalization in multiple theorem-proving frameworks to widen applicability

**Result:** Evaluation of advanced multimodal language models using MATP-BENCH revealed that current methods are only able to solve a limited subset of the benchmark problems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MATP-BENCH represents both a significant challenge and an opportunity for research in automated theorem proving using MLLMs, emphasizing the importance of integrated visual and mathematical reasoning.

**Abstract:** Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal, Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056 multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research on automated theorem proving.

**TL;DR:** CatShift is a label-only dataset-inference framework that identifies dataset membership of LLMs by analyzing output shifts due to catastrophic forgetting, offering a solution for data safety without internal logits.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of unauthorized usage of data in Large Language Models (LLMs) that can lead to copyright infringement and financial harm.

**Method:** CatShift utilizes the concept of catastrophic forgetting, where fine-tuning on a suspicious dataset causes significant output shifts in LLMs, compared to responses to known non-member data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a label-only framework for dataset inference in LLMs
	2. Utilizes catastrophic forgetting to identify previously learned data
	3. Proven effectiveness in logit-inaccessible environments

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate CatShift's effectiveness in detecting dataset membership in LLMs even when internal model logits are unavailable.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CatShift presents a robust approach for dataset inference that protects proprietary data without reliance on internal model signals.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language. However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material, yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.   We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs; conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus. Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

**Motivation:** To address the vulnerability of federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) to data extraction attacks, which threaten data privacy.

**Method:** The authors developed extraction attack algorithms specific to FedLLMs, operating under a new threat model where attackers access only a single client's data to extract PII from other clients, leveraging contextual prefixes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of new extraction attack algorithms for FedLLMs
	2. Development of rigorous metrics for evaluating extraction attacks
	3. Creation of a benchmark dataset annotated for PII to facilitate future research

**Result:** The proposed methods successfully extracted up to 56.57% of victim-exclusive PII with an impressive human-verified precision of 89.9%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the urgent need for robust defense strategies against extraction attacks in federated learning and establish benchmarks for future research in privacy preservation.

**Abstract:** Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk, we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57% of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Task-level conditioning is essential for improving LLM-generated code detection, providing a practical solution without requiring access to the original model or prompts.

**Abstract:** Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity. We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However, conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning (ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages, including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome inaccuracies in LLM-generated medical content and improve the functionality of RAG by organizing medical knowledge more effectively.

**Method:** Introduction of MIRIAD, which consists of 5,821,948 rephrased medical QA pairs grounded in peer-reviewed literature using a semi-automated pipeline for generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a large-scale curated corpus (MIRIAD) for medical QA pairs.
	2. Improvement in LLM accuracy and hallucination detection in medical contexts.
	3. Introduction of MIRIAD-Atlas for interactive exploration of medical knowledge.

**Result:** Augmenting LLMs with MIRIAD improved accuracy by up to 6.7% on medical QA benchmarks and enhanced detection of medical hallucinations by 22.5% to 37% (F1 score increase).

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MIRIAD enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare and supports various applications like medical information retrieval and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces.

**Abstract:** LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw, unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs, each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval. Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover, MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to 37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces, which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

### [81] [Reinforcing Code Generation: Improving Text-to-SQL with Execution-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06093)

*Atharv Kulkarni, Vivek Srikumar*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** code generation, large language models, reinforcement learning, SQL queries, execution feedback

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores code generation using LLMs, specifically SQL queries, by leveraging reinforcement learning with execution-based feedback instead of traditional supervised fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate if LLMs can improve SQL query generation through interaction with a database rather than relying solely on text-code pairs for training.

**Method:** The authors frame code generation as a reinforcement learning problem, utilizing execution-based feedback from a database to tune the model within the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced reinforcement learning for SQL generation with execution-based feedback.
	2. Showed the effectiveness of weak supervision with question-answer pairs in improving SQL accuracy.
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements nearing that of larger models with minimal fine-tuning.

**Result:** The model's accuracy for generated SQL queries improved from 31.49% to 49.83%, while the error percentage dropped from 25.43% to 14.71%, nearly matching the performance of SQLCoder-70B.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that execution-based feedback can significantly enhance the symbolic reasoning abilities of LLMs in generating SQL queries.

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards. These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from 25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, NLP classification, subjective annotations, hate speech detection, prompt design

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the ability of LLMs to capture human disagreement in subjective NLP tasks like hate speech detection using various labeling strategies and prompt design methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how LLMs can reflect annotator disagreement in subjective language tasks rather than relying solely on majority voting.

**Method:** The study uses in-context learning (ICL) in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs with different label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, disaggregated hard labels, and disaggregated soft labels.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of multi-perspective generation in LLMs for subjective tasks.
	2. Comparison of labeling strategies for LLM performance on subjective annotations.
	3. Insights into prompt design and its impact on LLM output quality.

**Result:** In zero-shot settings, LLMs can generate multi-perspective outputs, but few-shot setups struggle to fully represent human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection significantly impact performance.

**Limitations:** Few-shot setups often fail to capture the full spectrum of human judgments despite various selection strategies.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the challenges of modeling subjectivity in LLMs and highlight the need for developing perspective-aware models.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL) in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement (entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs. curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Automatic Speech Recognition, Phonetic Correction, Voice Search Applications

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a phonetic correction system to enhance the performance of end-to-end ASR models for voice search applications, particularly for recognizing infrequent movie titles.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in recognizing titles that are underrepresented in training data, thus facilitating better user experience in voice search applications.

**Method:** The proposed system includes a phonetic search that generates phonetic alternatives from the ASR output and a rescoring component that selects the final output by combining ASR recognition and these alternatives.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Phonetic alternatives generation based on ASR output
	2. Rescoring component to improve final output selection
	3. Demonstrated performance improvement over existing ASR systems

**Result:** The proposed approach demonstrates a relative improvement in word error rate by 4.4 to 7.6% on benchmarks of popular movie titles when compared to competitive baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The phonetic correction system significantly enhances the recognition accuracy of ASR systems, particularly for titles that may otherwise be poorly recognized.

**Abstract:** End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and hence, may suffer poor recognition.   In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic alternatives, and select a final system output.   We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6% relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive baselines.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Natural Language Inference, conditional reasoning, presupposition, Large Language Models, dataset

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study introduces CONFER, a dataset for evaluating Natural Language Inference (NLI) models on presupposition in conditionals, and assesses the performance of several NLI models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on this task.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the gap in understanding how NLI models process fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly in the context of conditional sentences.

**Method:** The research involves the introduction of the CONFER dataset and the evaluation of four NLI models and various LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot prompting to analyze their performance on presuppositional reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CONFER dataset for evaluating NLI models on conditional reasoning.
	2. Assessment of various NLI models and LLMs in the context of presupposition handling.
	3. Insights into the difficulties faced by NLI models in fine-grained reasoning tasks.

**Result:** The study finds that NLI models generally struggle with presuppositional reasoning in conditional sentences, and fine-tuning on existing datasets does not necessarily yield performance improvements.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by the selected models and dataset, potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings.

**Conclusion:** The results highlight significant challenges for NLI models in processing nuanced pragmatic inferences, suggesting a need for further research in this area.

**Abstract:** Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship. While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals, remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences. We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models, to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily improve their performance.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** contextualized embeddings, dative constructions, semantic interpretation, language models, NLU

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents an easy-to-use library called semantic-features for studying contextualized word embeddings of language models (LMs), demonstrating its application in analyzing the impact of dative constructions on meaning interpretation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To provide a tool for studying how different dative constructions influence the semantic interpretation of nouns in utterances, particularly in the context of language models.

**Method:** The authors conducted an experiment using a dataset of 450 sentence pairs differing in dative construction (prepositional vs. double object) to assess how these constructions affect the interpretation of the noun 'London'.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the semantic-features library for studying contextualized embeddings.
	2. Empirical demonstration of the impact of dative constructions on word interpretation.
	3. Dataset creation for testing semantic interpretations of ambiguous noun referents.

**Result:** The experiments revealed that the contextualized word embeddings from three masked language models were sensitive to the variations in dative constructions, supporting the potential of the semantic-features tool.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the effectiveness of the semantic-features library in analyzing contextualized embeddings, which could be beneficial for further research in language processing and understanding semantics in LMs.

**Abstract:** We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction (prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances (Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, chart generation, machine learning, accessibility, multi-agent systems

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a multi-agent pipeline that significantly reduces execution errors in code generated from natural-language chart descriptions, while highlighting issues with accessibility and hallucinations in generated charts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the persistent execution errors in code generated by large language models from natural-language chart descriptions, and to explore the impact of a multi-agent design on this issue.

**Method:** A lightweight multi-agent pipeline is proposed, which separates the processes of drafting, execution, repair, and judgment using an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-agent pipeline for chart description interpretation.
	2. Demonstrated significant reduction in execution errors compared to existing models.
	3. Highlighted the need for improved accessibility in generated charts.

**Result:** The proposed system reduces execution errors to 4.5% on the Text2Chart31 benchmark and 4.6% on the ChartX benchmark, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline.

**Limitations:** Some generated charts contain hallucinations, and low satisfaction of accessibility guidelines was found in generated outputs.

**Conclusion:** Future work should prioritize improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and accessibility rather than execution reliability, as current benchmarks show execution success is largely achieved.

**Abstract:** Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair, and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the \textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\% within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute. Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks, execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6 out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\% (\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines. These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and accessibility.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a voice phishing (VP) detector using the Llama3 language model, highlighting the efficacy of integrating human expert knowledge in prompts over Chain-of-Thought techniques.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance voice phishing detection capabilities with small language models by fine-tuning them and evaluating their performance under adversarial conditions.

**Method:** The study fine-tunes the Llama3 LM using a specially designed VP evaluation criteria and an adversarial test dataset while comparing performance with and without the Chain-of-Thought technique.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a voice phishing detector using Llama3
	2. Introduction of an adversarial test dataset for evaluation
	3. Demonstration of the efficacy of expert knowledge in prompts

**Result:** The fine-tuned Llama3-8B model with VP evaluation criteria outperforms other small language models and performs comparably to a GPT-4-based detector.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating expert knowledge into the model prompts proves more effective for small LMs in detecting voice phishing than solely relying on the Chain-of-Thought technique.

**Abstract:** We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together. In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in VP detection.

**Motivation:** To assess the ability of models in open-ended reasoning tasks, which resemble real-world problem-solving without clear definitions.

**Method:** The paper introduces PuzzleWorld, a dataset with 667 annotated puzzlehunt problems, focusing on step-wise reasoning and cognitive skills.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the PuzzleWorld benchmark for multimodal reasoning
	2. Detailed annotations for reasoning traces and cognitive skills
	3. Increased understanding of model performance in open-ended problem contexts

**Result:** State-of-the-art models score only 1-2% accuracy on final answers, with improvements seen only when fine-tuning on reasoning traces.

**Limitations:** Models exhibit myopic reasoning and insufficient capabilities in visual and spatial tasks.

**Conclusion:** Current models struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to limitations in language inference and lack of visual spatial reasoning capabilities; improvements can be made by using reasoning annotations.

**Abstract:** Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery, exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning, are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Automated systems for sexism detection struggle due to data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language, particularly in well-curated datasets such as EDOS.

**Method:** The authors propose two prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA) and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE), along with an ensemble strategy for fine-grained classification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA) to generate synthetic examples
	2. Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE) for enriching examples
	3. An ensemble strategy for resolving classification prediction ties

**Result:** Experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset shows state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in macro F1 scores for both binary and fine-grained classification tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods and ensemble strategy demonstrate enhanced model reliability and classification performance in detecting sexism in online content.

**Abstract:** The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5 points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained classification (Task C).

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the DSSP-RAG framework to improve RAG performance by resolving conflicts between LLM parametric knowledge and external knowledge through a dual-stream approach.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issues of hallucination in LLMs resulting from conflicting knowledge sources and lack of mechanisms to handle such conflicts in traditional RAG methods.

**Method:** The paper proposes a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG) that employs a refined mixed-attention mechanism to differentiate between shared and private semantics and integrates an unsupervised hallucination detection method.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the DSSP-RAG framework
	2. Refined mixed-attention mechanism for semantic distinction
	3. Unsupervised hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty

**Result:** DSSP-RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts and enhances the complementarity of dual-stream knowledge, outperforming strong baselines in extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** Potential complexity in implementation and the need for tuning of parameters, such as Energy Quotient.

**Conclusion:** The DSSP-RAG framework provides a significant improvement in the performance and stability of RAG methods by refining knowledge integration and conflict resolution.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore, current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts, making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability. Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

*Sabri Eyuboglu, Ryan Ehrlich, Simran Arora, Neel Guha, Dylan Zinsley, Emily Liu, Will Tennien, Atri Rudra, James Zou, Azalia Mirhoseini, Christopher Re*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, in-context learning, KV cache, Cartridge, self-study

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a method called self-study to efficiently train smaller KV caches (Cartridges) that replicate in-context learning performance at lower cost, achieving significant memory and throughput improvements.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To reduce the high cost and memory consumption associated with using large context windows in large language models for querying large text corpora.

**Method:** Train a smaller KV cache (Cartridge) on each corpus using a self-study approach, generating synthetic conversations and employing a context-distillation objective for training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Cartridge as an efficient KV cache
	2. Development of the self-study training method
	3. Demonstration of substantial reductions in memory usage and increases in throughput

**Result:** Cartridges trained with self-study match the performance of in-context learning while consuming 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput on long-context benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Self-study allows for a significant reduction in resource usage while maintaining the effective functionality of large context models, even extending context length substantially.

**Abstract:** Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL). Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However, we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective. We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference time without retraining.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the issue of biases related to text summarization generated by Large Language Models stemming from their pre-training data.

**Method:** AdvSumm is a domain-agnostic training framework that incorporates a Perturber component to apply gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the AdvSumm framework for bias mitigation in summarization

**Result:** AdvSumm significantly reduces biases in text summarization tasks, outperforming standard transformers and previous techniques like back-translation in mitigating specific biases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach shows that it is possible to enhance bias mitigation in summarization tasks without compromising output quality.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

**Conclusion:** CAT-LLM shows significant advancements in style transfer research, maintaining content integrity while enabling flexible style adaptations for Chinese text. It has substantial implications for automated content creation in Chinese digital media.

**Abstract:** Text style transfer plays a vital role in online entertainment and social media. However, existing models struggle to handle the complexity of Chinese long texts, such as rhetoric, structure, and culture, which restricts their broader application. To bridge this gap, we propose a Chinese Article-style Transfer (CAT-LLM) framework, which addresses the challenges of style transfer in complex Chinese long texts. At its core, CAT-LLM features a bespoke pluggable Text Style Definition (TSD) module that integrates machine learning algorithms to analyze and model article styles at both word and sentence levels. This module acts as a bridge, enabling LLMs to better understand and adapt to the complexities of Chinese article styles. Furthermore, it supports the dynamic expansion of internal style trees, enabling the framework to seamlessly incorporate new and diverse style definitions, enhancing adaptability and scalability for future research and applications. Additionally, to facilitate robust evaluation, we created ten parallel datasets using a combination of ChatGPT and various Chinese texts, each corresponding to distinct writing styles, significantly improving the accuracy of the model evaluation and establishing a novel paradigm for text style transfer research. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CAT-LLM, combined with GPT-3.5-Turbo, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a transfer accuracy F1 score of 79.36% and a content preservation F1 score of 96.47% on the "Fortress Besieged" dataset. These results highlight CAT-LLM's innovative contributions to style transfer research, including its ability to preserve content integrity while achieving precise and flexible style transfer across diverse Chinese text domains. Building on these contributions, CAT-LLM presents significant potential for advancing Chinese digital media and facilitating automated content creation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the processing of multi-modal information in light of limitations in data availability and computational requirements in multi-modal learning.

**Method:** The authors propose the Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model, which tokenizes speech and image data into discrete tokens and uses a multi-modal encoder-decoder for translation tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a Tri-Modal Translation model for speech, image, and text.
	2. Tokenization of speech and image data into discrete tokens for unified processing.
	3. Demonstration of the benefits of unifying tasks for practicality and performance.

**Result:** The TMT model significantly outperforms single model counterparts across six modality translation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Unifying multi-modal tasks not only simplifies the process but also enhances performance.

**Abstract:** The capability to jointly process multi-modal information is becoming an essential task. However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to overcome the limitations of current LLM-driven autonomous agents in software development, which restrict each phase to a single outcome, thus missing out on exploring diverse decision paths.

**Method:** The authors propose Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto), a framework that enables multiple autonomous agent teams to jointly suggest and refine various solutions through collaborative interaction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel framework, Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto)
	2. Demonstrated improved software development outcomes through multi-team collaboration
	3. Showed the adaptability of the framework to other domains, such as story generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Croto framework demonstrates superior performance and generalization across different domains, suggesting its potential value in software engineering as well as creative tasks like story generation.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted various domains, especially through organized LLM-driven autonomous agents. A representative scenario is in software development, where agents can collaborate in a team like humans, following predefined phases to complete sub-tasks sequentially. However, for an agent team, each phase yields only one possible outcome. This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space. Consequently leading to suboptimal results or extensive trial and error. To address this, we introduce Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various task-oriented solutions and interact with their insights in a self-independence while cross-team collaboration environment for superior solutions generation. Experiments reveal a notable increase in software quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We further tested our framework on story generation tasks, which demonstrated a promising generalization ability of our framework in other domains.

**Motivation:** To address the privacy concerns associated with instruction-following LLMs that may inadvertently disclose sensitive user information, there arises a need for effective machine unlearning techniques.

**Method:** The study introduces an optimal transport-based unlearning method, Opt-Out, which uses the Wasserstein distance to facilitate entity-level unlearning and introduces the Entity-Level Unlearning Dataset (ELUDe) for evaluation purposes.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Empirical results show that Opt-Out outperforms existing unlearning methods, offering a more effective approach for secure and adaptable LLMs capable of handling user data removal requests.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Opt-Out sets a new standard for enhancing the privacy of LLMs by allowing for selective user data removal while preserving overall model performance.

**Abstract:** Instruction-following large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become widely popular among everyday users. However, these models inadvertently disclose private, sensitive information to their users, underscoring the need for machine unlearning techniques to remove selective information from the models. While prior work has focused on forgetting small, random subsets of training data at the instance-level, we argue that real-world scenarios often require the removal of an entire user data, which may require a more careful maneuver. In this study, we explore entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase all knowledge related to a target entity while preserving the remaining model capabilities. To address this, we introduce Opt-Out, an optimal transport-based unlearning method that utilizes the Wasserstein distance from the model's initial parameters to achieve more effective and fine-grained unlearning. We also present the first Entity-Level Unlearning Dataset (ELUDe) designed to evaluate entity-level unlearning. Our empirical results demonstrate that Opt-Out surpasses existing methods, establishing a new standard for secure and adaptable LLMs that can accommodate user data removal requests without the need for full retraining.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the molecule-language alignment of LLMs by incorporating hierarchical structures in molecular representation, which are crucial for understanding biochemical functionalities.

**Method:** HIGHT employs a hierarchical graph tokenizer that captures the hierarchy of atom, motif, and molecular levels, and uses an augmented instruction tuning dataset enriched with hierarchical graph information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HIGHT for improved molecule-language alignment
	2. Hierarchical graph tokenizer design incorporating molecular structures
	3. Reduction of hallucinations and improved performance on real-world benchmarks

**Result:** HIGHT reduces hallucination by 40% and shows significant improvements in various molecule-language downstream tasks across 14 real-world benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed HIGHT significantly enhances the molecular perception capabilities of LLMs, addressing limitations of existing methods that overlook hierarchical information in molecules.

**Abstract:** Recently, there has been a surge of interest in extending the success of large language models (LLMs) from texts to molecules. Most existing approaches adopt a graph neural network to represent a molecule as a series of node tokens for molecule-language alignment, which, however, have overlooked the inherent hierarchical structures in molecules. Notably, higher-order molecular structures contain rich semantics of functional groups, which encode crucial biochemical functionalities of the molecules. We show that neglecting the hierarchical information in tokenization will lead to subpar molecule-language alignment and severe hallucination. To address this limitation, we propose HIerarchical GrapH Tokenization (HIGHT). HIGHT employs a hierarchical graph tokenizer that encodes the hierarchy of atom, motif, and molecular levels of informative tokens to improve the molecular perception of LLMs. HIGHT also adopts an augmented instruction tuning dataset, enriched with the hierarchical graph information, to further enhance the molecule-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmarks verify the effectiveness of HIGHT in reducing hallucination by 40%, and significant improvements in various molecule-language downstream tasks.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential of LLMs combined with online human belief records to provide insights into belief formation principles.

**Abstract:** Beliefs form the foundation of human cognition and decision-making, guiding our actions and social connections. A model encapsulating beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for understanding their influence on our actions. However, research on belief interplay has often been limited to beliefs related to specific issues and relied heavily on surveys. We propose a method to study the nuanced interplay between thousands of beliefs by leveraging an online user debate data and mapping beliefs onto a neural embedding space constructed using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief space captures the interconnectedness and polarization of diverse beliefs across social issues. Our findings show that positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals and estimate cognitive dissonance based on the distance between existing and new beliefs. This study demonstrates how LLMs, combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The traditional assumption in LLMs is that the probability of text relies solely on its canonical tokenization, despite existing non-unique tokenizations for the same string.

**Method:** The authors analyze the computational difficulty of identifying the most probable tokenization for an autoregressive LLM and compute marginal probabilities over all tokenizations, demonstrating empirical improvements by aggregating non-canonical probabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of complexity in finding the most likely tokenization for LLMs
	2. Demonstration of the indistinguishability of canonical and marginal probabilities
	3. Empirical improvements in LLM benchmarks through aggregation of non-canonical token probabilities

**Result:** The findings reveal that significant hidden signals exist within tokenization space, leading to performance enhancements on various LLM benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The study does not address the efficiency of implementing non-canonical tokenization in real-time LLM applications.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of considering non-canonical tokenizations in improving the evaluation of LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically shipped with tokenizers that deterministically encode text into so-called canonical token sequences, to which the LLMs assign probability values. One common assumption is that the probability of a piece of text is the probability of its canonical token sequence. However, the tokenization of a string is not unique: e.g., the Llama2 tokenizer encodes Tokens as [Tok,ens], but [Tok,en,s] also represents the same text. In this paper, we study non-canonical tokenizations. We prove that, given a string, it is computationally hard to find the most likely tokenization for an autoregressive LLM, as well as to compute the marginal probability over all possible tokenizations. We then show how the marginal is, in most cases, indistinguishable from the canonical probability. Surprisingly, we then empirically demonstrate the existence of a significant amount of signal hidden within tokenization space. Notably, by simply aggregating the probabilities of non-canonical tokenizations, we achieve improvements across a range of LLM evaluation benchmarks for a variety of architectures, including transformers and state space models.

**Keywords:** large language models, metacognition, judgments of learning, human-AI interaction, educational applications

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study examines the metacognitive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in predicting memory performance, specifically through human judgments of learning (JOL) with garden-path sentences. The findings reveal that while humans can predict their memory performance accurately, the tested LLMs do not demonstrate similar predictive abilities, highlighting a significant shortcoming in LLMs' metacognitive skills.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the metacognitive abilities of large language models, particularly their capacity to predict memory performance as done by humans.

**Method:** The study involved testing humans and various LLMs on pairs of sentences, manipulating contextual fit, and assessing how intrinsic cues affected both human and LLM JOL.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a cross-agent prediction model to assess LLMs' metacognitive abilities.
	2. Demonstrated that LLMs struggle with JOL tasks compared to humans.
	3. Identified key areas for improvement in LLMs for educational and interaction contexts.

**Result:** Human JOL reliably predicted actual memory performance, whereas none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o) succeeded in providing comparable predictive accuracy across different sentence contexts.

**Limitations:** The findings are based on a limited set of LLMs and specific sentence structures; further testing is needed for broader applicability.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for improvements in LLMs' metacognitive performance to make them more suitable for educational applications and human-AI interactions, suggesting that better self-monitoring capabilities could reduce the need for human oversight.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mimic human cognition in various language-based tasks. However, their capacity for metacognition - particularly in predicting memory performance - remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a cross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with human judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals predict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs of sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence - a sentence that initially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before requiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting sentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM and human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted actual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy. This discrepancy emerged regardless of whether sentences appeared in fitting or unfitting contexts. These findings indicate that, despite LLMs' demonstrated capacity to model human cognition at the object-level, they struggle at the meta-level, failing to capture the variability in individual memory predictions. By identifying this shortcoming, our study underscores the need for further refinements in LLMs' self-monitoring abilities, which could enhance their utility in educational settings, personalized learning, and human-AI interactions. Strengthening LLMs' metacognitive performance may reduce the reliance on human oversight, paving the way for more autonomous and seamless integration of AI into tasks requiring deeper cognitive awareness.

**Result:** The study finds significant changes in demographic bias due to acceleration optimizations, which are complex and unpredictable across different models and techniques.

**Limitations:** The study highlights that bias effects vary significantly across different models and acceleration strategies, making general conclusions difficult.

**Conclusion:** There is a critical need for detailed evaluation of bias in modified LLMs post-acceleration to ensure fairness and efficacy in applications.

**Abstract:** Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

**Conclusion:** TDA has the potential to enhance NLP research, though it faces challenges and is less adopted compared to other fields; further exploration is needed.

**Abstract:** The surge of data available on the internet has led to the adoption of various computational methods to analyze and extract valuable insights from this wealth of information. Among these, the field of Machine Learning (ML) has thrived by leveraging data to extract meaningful insights. However, ML techniques face notable challenges when dealing with real-world data, often due to issues of imbalance, noise, insufficient labeling, and high dimensionality. To address these limitations, some researchers advocate for the adoption of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a statistical approach that discerningly captures the intrinsic shape of data despite noise. Despite its potential, TDA has not gained as much traction within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain compared to structurally distinct areas like computer vision. Nevertheless, a dedicated community of researchers has been exploring the application of TDA in NLP, yielding 95 papers we comprehensively survey in this paper. Our findings categorize these efforts into theoretical and non-theoretical approaches. Theoretical approaches aim to explain linguistic phenomena from a topological viewpoint, while non-theoretical approaches merge TDA with ML features, utilizing diverse numerical representation techniques. We conclude by exploring the challenges and unresolved questions that persist in this niche field.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TEDUO represents a significant advancement in training autonomous agents capable of understanding and executing complex tasks specified in natural language, even in data-scarce environments.

**Abstract:** Developing autonomous agents capable of performing complex, multi-step decision-making tasks specified in natural language remains a significant challenge, particularly in realistic settings where labeled data is scarce and real-time experimentation is impractical. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often struggle to generalize to unseen goals and states, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we introduce TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning in symbolic environments. Unlike conventional methods, TEDUO operates on readily available, unlabeled datasets and addresses the challenge of generalization to previously unseen goals and states. Our approach harnesses large language models (LLMs) in a dual capacity: first, as automatization tools augmenting offline datasets with richer annotations, and second, as generalizable instruction-following agents. Empirical results demonstrate that TEDUO achieves data-efficient learning of robust language-conditioned policies, accomplishing tasks beyond the reach of conventional RL frameworks or out-of-the-box LLMs alone.

To bridge this gap, traditional process supervision relies on learned reward models requiring costly training data and suffering from reward misalignment, while outcome supervision fails for complex tasks needing coordinated intermediate steps. We introduce Outcome Refining Process Supervision, which unifies process and outcome supervision by leveraging executable verification: a tree-structured search framework generates strategic alternatives, profiles execution metrics, and scores candidates via self-critique mechanisms that integrate runtime feedback with reasoning. Experiments across 5 models and 3 benchmarks show consistent gains, with 26.9% higher correctness and 42.2% improved code efficiency.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research community simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire pioneering research directions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MapEval benchmark for geospatial AI assessment

**Result:** Evaluation of 30 foundation models revealed none surpassed 67% accuracy, with a significant performance gap compared to human capability.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on English and certain map interactions; may not capture all geographical contexts or user interactions.

**Conclusion:** There is a critical need for improved geospatial AI to enhance foundation models' performance in real-world navigation tasks.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in foundation models have improved autonomous tool usage and reasoning, but their capabilities in map-based reasoning remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce MapEval, a benchmark designed to assess foundation models across three distinct tasks - textual, API-based, and visual reasoning - through 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 180 cities and 54 countries, covering spatial relationships, navigation, travel planning, and real-world map interactions. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on simple location queries, MapEval requires models to handle long-context reasoning, API interactions, and visual map analysis, making it the most comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial AI. On evaluation of 30 foundation models, including Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, none surpass 67% accuracy, with open-source models performing significantly worse and all models lagging over 20% behind human performance. These results expose critical gaps in spatial inference, as models struggle with distances, directions, route planning, and place-specific reasoning, highlighting the need for better geospatial AI to bridge the gap between foundation models and real-world navigation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the performance degradation in large language models caused by indiscriminate layer pruning during model compression.

**Method:** GRASP (Gradient-based Retention of Adaptive Singular Parameters) uses gradient-based attribution on a small calibration dataset to identify and retain critical singular components, replacing redundant layers with a minimal set of parameters.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the GRASP compression framework
	2. Adaptive retention of critical singular values
	3. Performance preservation under significant compression

**Result:** GRASP outperforms existing compression methods, achieving 90% of the original model's performance with only a 20% compression ratio.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method allows for efficient model compression while maintaining performance, providing a better alternative to direct layer pruning.

**Abstract:** Recent studies have demonstrated that many layers are functionally redundant in large language models (LLMs), enabling model compression by removing these layers to reduce inference cost. While such approaches can improve efficiency, indiscriminate layer pruning often results in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose GRASP (Gradient-based Retention of Adaptive Singular Parameters), a novel compression framework that mitigates this issue by preserving sensitivity-aware singular values. Unlike direct layer pruning, GRASP leverages gradient-based attribution on a small calibration dataset to adaptively identify and retain critical singular components. By replacing redundant layers with only a minimal set of parameters, GRASP achieves efficient compression while maintaining strong performance with minimal overhead. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that GRASP consistently outperforms existing compression methods, achieving 90% of the original model's performance under a 20% compression ratio.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the emergent planning behaviors of LLMs, particularly how their hidden representations encode future outputs beyond just the next token.

**Method:** The authors use probing techniques to analyze LLM prompt representations, looking at global attributes of responses such as structure, content, and behavior.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of response planning in LLMs
	2. Analysis of scaling behavior with model size
	3. Exploration of planning evolution during response generation

**Result:** The research demonstrates that LLMs encode various attributes in their responses, including structural attributes like response length and reasoning steps, content attributes related to story choices, and behavioral attributes such as confidence.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Understanding how LLMs plan in their hidden representations has implications for transparency and control in generation tasks, with potential benefits for applications in HCI and AI technologies.

**Abstract:** In this work, we argue that large language models (LLMs), though trained to predict only the next token, exhibit emergent planning behaviors: $\textbf{their hidden representations encode future outputs beyond the next token}$. Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structure attributes}$ (e.g., response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (e.g., character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavior attributes}$ (e.g., answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggest potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the challenge of likelihood displacement in Direct Preference Optimization, which negatively impacts the model's ability to distinguish between preferred and dispreferred responses.

**Method:** The authors propose DPO-Shift, which adjusts the distribution of chosen probabilities during training of language models, and analyze its effects theoretically and empirically.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DPO-Shift to address likelihood displacement
	2. Theoretical analysis of the trade-off between chosen probability and reward margin
	3. Experimental validation showing superiority of DPO-Shift over traditional DPO methods

**Result:** DPO-Shift improves the chosen probability during training while addressing the trade-off with reward margin and outperforms DPO in downstream tasks like MT-Bench.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DPO-Shift effectively mitigates the likelihood displacement issue in DPO while maintaining alignment with human preferences, as demonstrated through both theory and experiments.

**Abstract:** Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become increasingly popular for aligning language models with human preferences. These methods aim to teach models to better distinguish between chosen (or preferred) and rejected (or dispreferred) responses. However, prior research has identified that the probability of chosen responses often decreases during training, and this phenomenon is known as likelihood displacement. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce DPO-Shift to controllably shift the distribution of the chosen probability. Then, we show that DPO-Shift exhibits a fundamental trade-off between improving the chosen probability and sacrificing the reward margin, as supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of DPO-Shift over DPO on downstream tasks such as MT-Bench and a designed win rate experiment. We believe this study shows that the likelihood displacement issue of DPO can be effectively mitigated with a simple, theoretically grounded solution. Our code is available at https://github.com/Meaquadddd/DPO-Shift.

**TL;DR:** In-context learning (ICL) for long passages in large language models (LLMs) reveals that LLMs struggle to relate demonstration passages to generation outputs; shorter meaningless passages can outperform longer meaningful ones.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL) using demonstration passages in large language models (LLMs), particularly for generation tasks.

**Method:** Experiments were conducted with various LLMs on single-document question answering and distractor generation tasks to assess the impact of demonstration passages on performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated that LLMs do not learn intrinsic relationships between demonstration passages and generation outputs.
	2. Provided empirical evidence that shorter meaningless passages can be more effective than longer meaningful ones in ICL tasks.
	3. Revealed limitations in LLM attention and information flow related to passage-level ICL.

**Result:** Findings showed that meaningless shorter passages outperformed longer demonstration passages, highlighting LLMs' limited attention to relevant context and low information transfer from passages to demonstrations.

**Limitations:** Insufficient attention and information flow from passages in LLMs; findings may not generalize across all tasks involving ICL.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that context compression techniques used in other tasks are ineffective for passage-level ICL, as even shorter meaningless passages yield competitive results.

**Abstract:** By simply incorporating demonstrations into the context, in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to yield awesome performance on many tasks. In this study, we focus on passage-level long-context ICL for generation tasks and find that LLMs cannot learn the intrinsic relationship between the demonstration passage and the generation output. We conduct experiments with different LLMs on two typical generation tasks including single-document question answering and distractor generation, demonstrating that even a completely meaningless demonstration passage with 1/4 length achieves much better performance than the original full passage. Analysis via attention and information flow reveals that LLMs pay little attention to passages compared to other components in the prompt and little information flows from the passage to other parts of the demonstration, which further confirms our finding. Additionally, experiments on context compression indicate that compression approaches proven effective on other long-context tasks are not suitable for passage-level ICL, since simply using shorter meaningless demonstration passages already achieves competitive performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a standardized evaluation framework for claim extraction
	2. Development of automated methods for applying this framework
	3. Introduction of Claimify, an LLM-based method that outperforms existing techniques

**Result:** Claimify, the proposed LLM-based claim extraction method, outperforms existing methods when subjected to the new evaluation framework.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of claim quality in automated fact-checking and demonstrates that Claimify efficiently handles ambiguity while ensuring confidence in claim extraction.

**Abstract:** A common strategy for fact-checking long-form content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is extracting simple claims that can be verified independently. Since inaccurate or incomplete claims compromise fact-checking results, ensuring claim quality is critical. However, the lack of a standardized evaluation framework impedes assessment and comparison of claim extraction methods. To address this gap, we propose a framework for evaluating claim extraction in the context of fact-checking along with automated, scalable, and replicable methods for applying this framework, including novel approaches for measuring coverage and decontextualization. We also introduce Claimify, an LLM-based claim extraction method, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods under our evaluation framework. A key feature of Claimify is its ability to handle ambiguity and extract claims only when there is high confidence in the correct interpretation of the source text.

**Result:** TituLLMs outperform initial multilingual versions in benchmarking, while also exposing challenges in language adaptation.

**Limitations:** The performance of TituLLMs is not consistently better across all benchmarks, indicating complexity in language adaptation.

**Conclusion:** The creation of TituLLMs and their associated benchmarking datasets will encourage further research and adaptation of multilingual models to low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present TituLLMs, the first large pretrained Bangla LLMs, available in 1b and 3b parameter sizes. Due to computational constraints during both training and inference, we focused on smaller models. To train TituLLMs, we collected a pretraining dataset of approximately ~37 billion tokens. We extended the Llama-3.2 tokenizer to incorporate language- and culture-specific knowledge, which also enables faster training and inference. There was a lack of benchmarking datasets to benchmark LLMs for Bangla. To address this gap, we developed five benchmarking datasets. We benchmarked various LLMs, including TituLLMs, and demonstrated that TituLLMs outperforms its initial multilingual versions. However, this is not always the case, highlighting the complexities of language adaptation. Our work lays the groundwork for adapting existing multilingual open models to other low-resource languages. To facilitate broader adoption and further research, we have made the TituLLMs models and benchmarking datasets publicly available (https://huggingface.co/collections/hishab/titulm-llama-family-6718d31fc1b83529276f490a).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand and improve the efficiency-quality trade-offs of inference-time algorithms in constrained generation tasks.

**Method:** A mathematical framework is proposed to explore the interaction between a pre-trained language model generator (oracle) and a process verifier, which determines the extent to which a generated prefix meets specific constraints.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a mathematical framework for constrained generation
	2. Demonstration of verifier-assisted algorithm benefits in various generation tasks
	3. Empirical results showing improved efficiency and diversity through backtracking sampling

**Result:** Access to a verifier transforms an otherwise intractable problem into a tractable one, with simple algorithms like tokenwise rejection sampling gaining substantial benefits from verifier access.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Using backtracking in tokenwise rejection sampling significantly improves computational efficiency, accuracy, and diversity in constrained generation settings compared to traditional sampling methods.

**Abstract:** Recently, a plethora of works have proposed inference-time algorithms (e.g. best-of-n), which incorporate verifiers to assist the generation process. Their quality-efficiency trade-offs have been empirically benchmarked on a variety of constrained generation tasks, but the algorithmic design landscape is still largely poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for reasoning about constrained generation using a pre-trained language model generator oracle and a process verifier--which can decide whether a prefix can be extended to a string which satisfies the constraints of choice. We show that even in very simple settings, access to a verifier can render an intractable problem (information-theoretically or computationally) to a tractable one. In fact, we show even simple algorithms, like tokenwise rejection sampling, can enjoy significant benefits from access to a verifier. Empirically, we show that a natural modification of tokenwise rejection sampling, in which the sampler is allowed to "backtrack" (i.e., erase the final few generated tokens) has robust and substantive benefits over natural baselines (e.g. (blockwise) rejection sampling, nucleus sampling)--both in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy and diversity.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the information leakage through synthetic data generated by Large Language Models using membership inference attacks (MIAs), highlighting the challenges of privacy auditing with such data.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how much information about training samples can be leaked through synthetic data generated by LLMs and to challenge the perception of privacy in synthetic data release.

**Method:** The paper designs membership inference attacks targeting training data used for fine-tuning LLMs, focusing on the effectiveness of canaries in privacy auditing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Design of effective membership inference attacks against LLM-generated synthetic data
	2. Introduction of improved canaries for privacy auditing
	3. Demonstration of privacy risks inherent in synthetic data generation from LLMs

**Result:** The MIAs show significant performance, indicating that synthetic data can leak information about training data. The authors also discover that traditional canaries are ineffective for assessing privacy risks when only synthetic data are released.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on LLMs and does not address potential solutions for all types of synthetic data generation pipelines.

**Conclusion:** By leveraging auto-regressive models to create enhanced canaries, this work improves the assessment of privacy risks associated with synthetic data generated by LLMs.

**Abstract:** How much information about training samples can be leaked through synthetic data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)? Overlooking the subtleties of information flow in synthetic data generation pipelines can lead to a false sense of privacy. In this paper, we assume an adversary has access to some synthetic data generated by a LLM. We design membership inference attacks (MIAs) that target the training data used to fine-tune the LLM that is then used to synthesize data. The significant performance of our MIA shows that synthetic data leak information about the training data. Further, we find that canaries crafted for model-based MIAs are sub-optimal for privacy auditing when only synthetic data is released. Such out-of-distribution canaries have limited influence on the model's output when prompted to generate useful, in-distribution synthetic data, which drastically reduces their effectiveness. To tackle this problem, we leverage the mechanics of auto-regressive models to design canaries with an in-distribution prefix and a high-perplexity suffix that leave detectable traces in synthetic data. This enhances the power of data-based MIAs and provides a better assessment of the privacy risks of releasing synthetic data generated by LLMs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** AI, nonverbal communication, video question answering, social intelligence, mime videos

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a new dataset, MimeQA, to enhance AI's understanding of nonverbal social communication through mime videos, revealing weaknesses in current video language models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve AI's capability in understanding nonverbal social reasoning, which current models struggle with due to a reliance on language-only approaches.

**Method:** The study creates the MimeQA dataset consisting of 806 annotated question-answer pairs derived from 8 hours of mime videos sourced from YouTube, and evaluates state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) on this dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MimeQA dataset for nonverbal social reasoning
	2. Evaluation of vLLMs on nonverbal cues
	3. Highlighting the failure of vLLMs to ground imagined objects and comprehend subtle interactions.

**Result:** vLLMs showed low accuracy (20-30%) in interpreting nonverbal cues from mime videos, significantly lower than human accuracy (86%).

**Limitations:** The dataset only contains mime videos, which may not represent all forms of nonverbal communication; also, the model evaluations are limited to state-of-the-art vLLMs, which may not fully capture potential advancements in the field.

**Conclusion:** There is a critical need for AI systems that can understand and interpret nonverbal interactions, beyond current language-dominant models.

**Abstract:** As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities, socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.

**Abstract:** This study introduces a novel natural language processing pipeline that enhances customer service efficiency at Telekom Srbija, a leading Serbian telecommunications company, through automated email topic detection and labeling. Central to the pipeline is BERTopic, a modular framework that allows unsupervised topic modeling. After a series of preprocessing and postprocessing steps, we assign one of 12 topics and several additional labels to incoming emails, allowing customer service to filter and access them through a custom-made application. While applied to Serbian, the methodology is conceptually language-agnostic and can be readily adapted to other languages, particularly those that are low-resourced and morphologically rich. The system performance was evaluated by assessing the speed and correctness of the automatically assigned topics, with a weighted average processing time of 0.041 seconds per email and a weighted average F1 score of 0.96. The system now operates in the company's production environment, streamlining customer service operations through automated email classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To clarify the robustness and dependence of emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models on structured reasoning mechanisms.

**Method:** The authors analyze the internal processes of LLMs, identifying three distinct computational stages: symbol abstraction in early layers, symbolic induction in intermediate layers, and retrieval in later layers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of a symbolic architecture in LLMs
	2. Description of three distinct computational layers
	3. Insights into the relationship between symbolic reasoning and neural models

**Result:** The research uncovers a symbolic architecture in LLMs, indicating that these models utilize symbolic mechanisms to support abstract reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Emergent reasoning capabilities in neural networks, including LLMs, are linked to the emergence of symbolic reasoning mechanisms, contributing to the symbolic vs. neural network debate.

**Abstract:** Many recent studies have found evidence for emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), but debate persists concerning the robustness of these capabilities, and the extent to which they depend on structured reasoning mechanisms. To shed light on these issues, we study the internal mechanisms that support abstract reasoning in LLMs. We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.

**Keywords:** automated fact-checking, multi-hop reasoning, entity-relationship graphs, GraphCheck, DP-GraphCheck

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** GraphCheck is a framework for automated fact-checking that uses entity-relationship graphs for verifying complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning, with a variant called DP-GraphCheck that adapts its approach based on claim complexity.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of verifying complex claims that require multi-hop reasoning in automated fact-checking systems.

**Method:** GraphCheck transforms claims into entity-relationship graphs and systematically models reasoning paths for verification. DP-GraphCheck introduces a strategy selector for adapting the verification method based on the complexity of the claim.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of GraphCheck framework for structured verification of claims
	2. Development of DP-GraphCheck with adaptive strategy selection
	3. Demonstration of improved performance on multi-hop claims using extensive datasets

**Result:** Experiments showed that GraphCheck outperforms existing methods on multi-hop claims, and DP-GraphCheck effectively generalizes to other fact-checking pipelines, improving accuracy and efficiency.

**Limitations:** GraphCheck may be overly complex for simpler claims, necessitating the need for the DP-GraphCheck variant.

**Conclusion:** The selective mechanism in DP-GraphCheck enhances the robustness and applicability of the fact-checking process, highlighting its potential for broader use in different contexts.

**Abstract:** Automated fact-checking aims to assess the truthfulness of textual claims based on relevant evidence. However, verifying complex claims that require multi-hop reasoning remains a significant challenge. We propose GraphCheck, a novel framework that transforms claims into entity-relationship graphs for structured and systematic verification. By explicitly modeling both explicit and latent entities and exploring multiple reasoning paths, GraphCheck improves verification robustness. While GraphCheck excels in complex scenarios, it may be unnecessarily elaborate for simpler claims. To address this, we introduce DP-GraphCheck, a variant that employs a lightweight strategy selector to adaptively choose between direct prompting and GraphCheck. This selective mechanism improves both accuracy and efficiency by applying the appropriate level of reasoning to each claim. Experiments on the HOVER and EX-FEVER datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly on multi-hop claims. Moreover, the strategy selection mechanism in DP-GraphCheck generalizes well to other fact-checking pipelines, highlighting the versatility of our framework.

**Keywords:** adversarial tokenization, large language models, LLM safety, semantic understanding, vulnerability

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the implications of adversarial tokenization in LLMs, demonstrating vulnerabilities that allow malicious strings to evade safety measures.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the impact of tokenization on the safety and alignment of LLMs, particularly focusing on adversarial techniques that exploit multiple valid tokenizations.

**Method:** The authors empirically test the effectiveness of adversarial tokenization on three state-of-the-art LLMs using various adversarial datasets, comparing it with existing adversarial strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifying adversarial tokenization as a previously overlooked method of attack on LLMs.
	2. Empirical validation of the effectiveness of adversarial tokenization across multiple LLMs.
	3. Revealing vulnerabilities in subword tokenization methods that could lead to security risks.

**Result:** The study finds that adversarial tokenization is an effective attack method that reveals a vulnerability in subword models, allowing harmful requests to bypass restrictions without altering the text itself.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adversarial tokenization should be considered a crucial aspect of LLM safety strategies, as it poses a competitive threat against traditional adversarial techniques.

**Abstract:** Current LLM pipelines account for only one possible tokenization for a given string, ignoring exponentially many alternative tokenizations during training and inference. For example, the standard Llama3 tokenization of penguin is [p,enguin], yet [peng,uin] is another perfectly valid alternative. In this paper, we show that despite LLMs being trained solely on one tokenization, they still retain semantic understanding of other tokenizations, raising questions about their implications in LLM safety. Put succinctly, we answer the following question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets, revealing a previously unknown vulnerability in subword models.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** TRACT introduces a two-stage fine-tuning method that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with regression-aware training for large language models used in text evaluation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for using LLMs as judges for text scoring neglect the numeric nature of score prediction and fail to incorporate chain-of-thought reasoning effectively.

**Method:** TRACT consists of two stages: initial fine-tuning of a seed LLM to generate chain-of-thoughts, followed by a second stage fine-tuning that uses these CoTs as supervision, optimizing both cross-entropy and regression-aware losses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TRACT methodology combining CoT reasoning with regression-aware training
	2. Demonstrated significant performance improvements on multiple datasets
	3. Extensive validation of the importance of TRACT components through ablation studies.

**Result:** TRACT significantly outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge methods across four datasets and two LLM architectures.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The two-stage approach in TRACT enhances the LLM's reasoning capabilities and improves score prediction accuracy.

**Abstract:** The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm uses large language models (LLMs) for automated text evaluation, where a numerical assessment is assigned by an LLM to the input text following scoring rubrics. Existing methods for LLM-as-a-judge use cross-entropy (CE) loss for fine-tuning, which neglects the numeric nature of score prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning, which, however, does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), a method combining CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT consists of two stages: first, seed LLM is fine-tuned to generate CoTs, which serve as supervision for the second stage fine-tuning. The training objective of TRACT combines the CE loss for learning the CoT reasoning capabilities, and the regression-aware loss for the score prediction. Experiments across four LLM-as-a-judge datasets and two LLMs show that TRACT significantly outperforms existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the importance of each component in TRACT.

**Motivation:** To improve ride-hailing services by using a conversational interface that considers complex urban spatiotemporal contexts.

**Method:** DiMA uses a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module and a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multiple dialogue types while utilizing continual fine-tuning based on user interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Spatiotemporal-aware order planning module
	2. Cost-effective dialogue system with multiple repliers
	3. Continual fine-tuning scheme based on real user interactions

**Result:** DiMA achieved 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art frameworks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DiMA is proven to be an effective and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency.

**Abstract:** On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces JuICE, a method that addresses knowledge conflicts in language models by altering attention behavior during inference to improve performance and generalization.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the issue of conflicting knowledge in language models caused by the interaction between parametric memory and contextual knowledge.

**Method:** JuICE employs a dual-run approach by identifying reliable attention heads to guide the model towards either parametric beliefs or contextual knowledge during inference, without the need for fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduce the phenomenon of superposition in attention heads
	2. Propose JuICE as a practical intervention for knowledge conflicts
	3. Demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple datasets

**Result:** JuICE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 11 datasets and 6 model architectures, demonstrating significant improvements in handling different types of knowledge conflicts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The insights on knowledge conflict and the proposed method enhance the understanding of attention head dynamics and provide a robust solution for better integrating contextual and parametric information.

**Abstract:** Language Models (LMs) often encounter knowledge conflicts when parametric memory contradicts contextual knowledge. Previous works attribute this conflict to the interplay between "memory heads" and "context heads", attention heads assumed to promote either memory or context exclusively. In this study, we go beyond this fundamental assumption by uncovering a critical phenomenon we term the superposition of contextual information and parametric memory, where highly influential attention heads simultaneously contribute to both memory and context. Building upon this insight, we propose Just Run Twice (JuICE), a test-time attention intervention method that steers LMs toward either parametric beliefs or contextual knowledge without requiring fine-tuning. JuICE identifies a set of reliable attention heads and leverages a dual-run approach to mitigate the superposition effects. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets and 6 model architectures demonstrate that JuICE sets the new state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization, achieving significant and consistent improvement across different domains under various conflict types. Finally, we theoretically analyze knowledge conflict and the superposition of contextual information and parametric memory in attention heads, which further elucidates the effectiveness of JuICE in these settings.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the relationship between reasoning ability in generative language models and their capacity to mitigate stereotypical bias, proposing a novel fine-tuning method called ReGiFT.

**Read time:** 17 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how reasoning capabilities in language models impact their fairness and ability to reduce bias in responses, particularly those that are harmful or stereotypical.

**Method:** The authors evaluate various open-source large language models on their reasoning abilities and stereotypical bias, introducing the ReGiFT approach to improve fairness through reasoning traces without specific bias supervision.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the ReGiFT approach for infusing reasoning traces into biased models
	2. Demonstrated that improved reasoning abilities can mitigate stereotypical bias
	3. Provided a comprehensive evaluation of open-source LLMs regarding reasoning and fairness

**Result:** Larger models with stronger reasoning abilities show significantly lower levels of stereotypical bias. Models fine-tuned with ReGiFT not only improve fairness but also outperform advanced reasoning models in fairness benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Enhancing reasoning capabilities is a promising strategy for reducing bias in language models, demonstrating that improvements in reasoning can lead to better fairness results without specific bias-focused training.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) understand knowledge boundaries across different languages, addressing a gap in previous research focused solely on English.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucinations, particularly in low-resource languages.

**Method:** The study probes LLMs' internal representations while processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages, analyzing their recognition of knowledge boundaries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First study analyzing LLMs' knowledge boundaries across multiple languages.
	2. Proposal of a training-free alignment method to improve knowledge boundary perception.
	3. Creation of a multilingual evaluation suite for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis.

**Result:** The research identifies that LLMs encode knowledge boundaries in specific layers, exhibits a linear structure of language differences, and finds that fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation improves boundary recognition.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings lead to a training-free alignment method for enhancing knowledge boundary perception across languages, with a new multilingual evaluation suite introduced for future research.

**Abstract:** While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucination, research on the knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs' perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LLM-Multilingual-Knowledge-Boundaries.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of current static and outdated benchmark datasets for chatbot evaluation, which fail to capture linguistic and cultural variations.

**Method:** A multi-agent framework utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs to generate multilingual dialogues and analyze chatbot performance using a strong LLM for cross-lingual comparison.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MEDAL framework for multi-agent dialogue evaluation
	2. Development of a meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark
	3. Analysis of LLMs' performance on nuanced dialogue evaluation tasks

**Result:** The study uncovers significant cross-lingual performance differences among chatbots and reveals that current LLMs struggle with nuanced evaluations, especially in areas like empathy and reasoning.

**Limitations:** Current LLMs are ineffective at detecting nuanced issues in dialogue.

**Conclusion:** A new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark is developed, indicating limitations in LLMs' evaluation capabilities in open-domain dialogue.

**Abstract:** As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.
