### [1] [A Paradigm for Creative Ownership](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15971)

*Tejaswi Polimetla, Katy Ilonka Gero*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** creative ownership, human-AI collaboration, HCI, creative agency, interactive tool

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a framework for understanding creative ownership in the context of human-AI collaboration, highlighting psychological, material, and immaterial dimensions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The integration of generative AI in creative workflows raises pressing questions about ownership and personal connection to creative products.

**Method:** The authors develop a framework categorizing creative ownership into three domains: Person, Process, and System, with an interactive tool for evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a triadic framework for creative ownership.
	2. Develops an interactive tool for evaluating ownership sentiment.
	3. Links the complexities of ownership to human-AI collaboration in creative processes.

**Result:** The framework helps visualize and assess ownership sentiment, aiding in understanding creative agency in human-AI collaboration.

**Limitations:** The framework may require further empirical validation and testing across diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** This model provides a new perspective for supporting creative agency and encourages empirical research in design and HCI-related fields.

**Abstract:** As generative AI tools become more integrated into creative workflows, questions of ownership in co-creative contexts have become increasingly urgent. While legal frameworks offer definitions of ownership rooted in intellectual property, they often overlook the nuanced, psychological experience of creative ownership - how individuals come to feel that a creative product is "theirs." Drawing on interdisciplinary literature in philosophy, psychology, and the social sciences and humanities more broadly, we introduce a new framework that surfaces the material and immaterial dimensions of creative ownership. Our model organizes creative ownership into three domains - Person, Process, and System - each of which contains subdimensions that shape ownership sentiment. We offer an accompanying interactive tool that enables creators and researchers to visualize and evaluate ownership across a range of contexts. This paradigm provides a new lens through which to understand and support creative agency in human-AI collaboration, and lays the groundwork for future empirical research in design and human-computer interaction.

**Motivation:** To investigate the role of AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR storytelling and validate its effects on multi-modal content generation.

**Method:** An exploratory study analyzing 223 AR videos, followed by two studies with 30 experienced storytellers to evaluate preferences for modalities and the quality of AIGC.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of a design space for multi-modal AR storytelling
	2. Development of a testbed for content generation
	3. Evaluation of storyteller preferences and quality of AI-generated content

**Result:** Preferences for various modalities were revealed, and interactions with AI for content generation were evaluated, providing insights into the quality of generated content for AR storytelling.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by the sample size of N=30 storytellers and the focus on specific modalities within AR storytelling.

**Conclusion:** The study identifies a design space for multi-modal AR storytelling and suggests future design considerations involving the use of Generative AI.

**Abstract:** Storytelling in AR has gained attention due to its multi-modality and interactivity. However, generating multi-modal content for AR storytelling requires expertise and efforts for high-quality conveyance of the narrator's intention. Recently, Generative-AI (GenAI) has shown promising applications in multi-modal content generation. Despite the potential benefit, current research calls for validating the effect of AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR Storytelling. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate the utilization of GenAI. Analyzing 223 AR videos, we identified a design space for multi-modal AR Storytelling. Based on the design space, we developed a testbed facilitating multi-modal content generation and atomic elements in AR Storytelling. Through two studies with N=30 experienced storytellers and live presenters, we 1. revealed participants' preferences for modalities, 2. evaluated the interactions with AI to generate content, and 3. assessed the quality of the AIGC for AR Storytelling. We further discussed design considerations for future AR Storytelling with GenAI.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the increasing impact of stress, anxiety, and depression on college students and the barriers they face to traditional mental health care.

**Method:** A 12-week randomized controlled trial involving 117 participants, comparing a treatment group using the full mHELP intervention to a control group using only stress logging and assessments, with outcomes analyzed through Generalized Linear Mixed Models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the efficacy of a wearable mHealth intervention for stress management.
	2. Identified the difference between objective and subjective measures of mental health outcomes.
	3. Outlined the need for more targeted interventions in mobile health applications.

**Result:** The treatment group experienced a significant decrease in objective measures of Moments of Stress, whereas subjective measures showed clinically meaningful improvements but no significant between-group differences.

**Limitations:** No notable between-group differences in subjective outcomes for anxiety, depression, and stress.

**Conclusion:** Wearable-enabled mHealth tools have the potential to alleviate acute stress among college populations, but more tailored and extended interventions are required for chronic mental health issues like depression.

**Abstract:** College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117), participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly, secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like depression.

RDW enables users to explore virtual environments (VEs) larger than their physical space, addressing the constraints of real walking in limited home VR setups. Our review spans 232 papers, with 165 included in the final analysis. We categorize perception-based RDW techniques based on gains, gain application, target orientation calculation, and optional general enhancements, identifying key patterns and relationships. We present data on how current work aligns within this classification system and suggest how this data can guide future work into areas that are relatively under explored. This taxonomy clarifies perception-based RDW techniques, guiding the design and application of RDW systems, and suggests future research directions to enhance VR user experience.

### [5] ["AI just keeps guessing": Using ARC Puzzles to Help Children Identify Reasoning Errors in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16034)

*Aayushi Dangol, Trushaa Ramanan, Runhua Zhao, Julie A. Kientz, Robert Wolfe, Jason Yip*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** generative AI, error detection, interactivity, children, Cognitive Theory

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces AI Puzzlers, an interactive system designed to help children critically engage with generative AI by identifying and analyzing errors in its outputs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to equip children with competencies to critically assess generative AI due to the misleading confidence it can convey through its authoritative tone.

**Method:** The system was developed based on Mayer & Moreno's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and involves children in participatory design sessions for feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of AI Puzzlers for error detection in genAI outputs
	2. Empirical insights from participatory design with children
	3. Application of cognitive theories to enhance learning about genAI

**Result:** Findings reveal how children identify errors in AI reasoning, strategize to navigate those errors, and evaluate AI outputs effectively.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the engagement of children aged 6-11 and may not generalize to older populations or different educational contexts.

**Conclusion:** AI Puzzlers offers insights into designing educational tools for enhancing children's interaction with generative AI.

**Abstract:** The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) into everyday life raises questions about the competencies required to critically engage with these technologies. Unlike visual errors in genAI, textual mistakes are often harder to detect and require specific domain knowledge. Furthermore, AI's authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this, we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI. Drawing on Mayer & Moreno's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21 children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning, develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.

### [6] [Signals of Provenance: Practices & Challenges of Navigating Indicators in AI-Generated Media for Sighted and Blind Individuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16057)

*Ayae Ide, Tory Park, Jaron Mink, Tanusree Sharma*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI-generated content, human-computer interaction, accessibility, blind and low vision, user experience

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The study examines the interactions of sighted and blind/low vision (BLV) individuals with AI-generated content through self-disclosed indicators, revealing usability challenges and proposing design recommendations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the accessibility issues of AI-generated content (AIG) indicators for users with different sensory abilities, particularly blind/low vision individuals.

**Method:** Conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 participants (15 sighted, 13 BLV) to explore their interactions with AIG content and indicators.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examined diverse mental models of sighted and BLV users regarding AIG indicators.
	2. Identified usability challenges that hinder effective interaction with AIG content for BLV individuals.
	3. Provided practical recommendations for designing more accessible AIG indicators.

**Result:** Findings indicate that sighted participants utilize visual and auditory cues effectively, while BLV participants rely heavily on audio and assistive tools, often missing menu-aided indicators and facing usability challenges.

**Limitations:** The study's findings may be limited to the specific group of participants interviewed and may not generalize to all users of AIG content.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for improved design of AIG indicators to enhance accessibility for all users and offers practical recommendations based on identified challenges.

**Abstract:** AI-Generated (AIG) content has become increasingly widespread by recent advances in generative models and the easy-to-use tools that have significantly lowered the technical barriers for producing highly realistic audio, images, and videos through simple natural language prompts. In response, platforms are adopting provable provenance with platforms recommending AIG to be self-disclosed and signaled to users. However, these indicators may be often missed, especially when they rely solely on visual cues and make them ineffective to users with different sensory abilities. To address the gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=28) with 15 sighted and 13 BLV participants to examine their interaction with AIG content through self-disclosed AI indicators. Our findings reveal diverse mental models and practices, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses of content-based (e.g., title, description) and menu-aided (e.g., AI labels) indicators. While sighted participants leveraged visual and audio cues, BLV participants primarily relied on audio and existing assistive tools, limiting their ability to identify AIG. Across both groups, they frequently overlooked menu-aided indicators deployed by platforms and rather interacted with content-based indicators such as title and comments. We uncovered usability challenges stemming from inconsistent indicator placement, unclear metadata, and cognitive overload. These issues were especially critical for BLV individuals due to the insufficient accessibility of interface elements. We provide practical recommendations and design implications for future AIG indicators across several dimensions.

**Method:** Pilot study with 37 fifth-graders (ages 9-10) exploring their visions of generative AI and its roles in their daily lives.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified children's positive and negative perceptions of generative AI
	2. Highlighted the importance of child-centric AI design
	3. Provided insights into how children envision the roles of AI in education

**Result:** Children envision genAI as a companion, collaborator, and task automator, while also expressing fears about overreliance impacting their learning and future.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the necessity for AI design focused on children's needs, promoting skills for critical engagement with technology.

**Abstract:** As generative artificial intelligence (genAI) increasingly mediates how children learn, communicate, and engage with digital content, understanding children's hopes and fears about this emerging technology is crucial. In a pilot study with 37 fifth-graders, we explored how children (ages 9-10) envision genAI and the roles they believe it should play in their daily life. Our findings reveal three key ways children envision genAI: as a companion providing guidance, a collaborator working alongside them, and a task automator that offloads responsibilities. However, alongside these hopeful views, children expressed fears about overreliance, particularly in academic settings, linking it to fears of diminished learning, disciplinary consequences, and long-term failure. This study highlights the need for child-centric AI design that balances these tensions, empowering children with the skills to critically engage with and navigate their evolving relationships with digital technologies.

### [8] [Fairness and Efficiency in Human-Agent Teams: An Iterative Algorithm Design Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16171)

*Mai Lee Chang, Kim Baraka, Greg Trafton, Zach Lalu Vazhekatt, Andrea Lockerd Thomaz*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** human-agent teams, fairness, task allocation, first-person perspective, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the impact of first-person perspectives on fairness in task allocation within human-agent teams, proposing a novel fairness metric and algorithm that balance efficiency and perceived fairness.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing fairness metrics that primarily consider third-person perspectives in team dynamics involving agents and humans.

**Method:** An iterative design method is utilized, combining simulation data and human data to develop a task allocation algorithm that incorporates both capabilities and preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the fair-equity metric
	2. Development of the Fair-Efficient Algorithm (FEA)
	3. Demonstrated significance of first-person POV in perceived fairness

**Result:** The proposed fair-equity metric and Fair-Efficient Algorithm (FEA) demonstrate improved perceptions of fairness and preference for agents that balance efficiency and fairness based on equity from a first-person point of view.

**Limitations:** The study may not generalize to all types of agent-human interactions beyond task allocation.

**Conclusion:** Perceived fairness in human-agent interactions is significantly influenced by individual perspectives, highlighting the need for metrics that incorporate personal preferences in task allocation.

**Abstract:** When agents interact with people as part of a team, fairness becomes an important factor. Prior work has proposed fairness metrics based on teammates' capabilities for task allocation within human-agent teams. However, most metrics only consider teammate capabilities from a third-person point of view (POV). In this work, we extend these metrics to include task preferences and consider a first-person POV. We leverage an iterative design method consisting of simulation data and human data to design a task allocation algorithm that balances task efficiency and fairness based on both capabilities and preferences. We first show that these metrics may not align with people's perceived fairness from a first-person POV. In light of this result, we propose a new fairness metric, fair-equity, and the Fair-Efficient Algorithm (FEA). Our findings suggest that an agent teammate who balances efficiency and fairness based on equity will be perceived to be fairer and preferred by human teammates in various human-agent team types. We suggest that the perception of fairness may also depend on a person's POV.

### [9] [Reassessing Collaborative Writing Theories and Frameworks in the Age of LLMs: What Still Applies and What We Must Leave Behind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16254)

*Daisuke Yukita, Tim Miller, Joel Mackenzie*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Human-AI collaboration, Collaborative writing, LLM, Design implications, Cognitive processes

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper reviews theories on human-human collaborative writing to inform the design of human-AI writing tools, highlighting shifts in methodology due to LLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the relevance of human-human collaborative writing theories in the context of human-AI collaboration, particularly in professional environments.

**Method:** Conducting a critical review of existing theories and frameworks on collaborative writing and drawing insights for design implications in human-AI collaborative writing tools.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified seven insights and design implications for human-AI collaborative writing tools.
	2. Outlined the importance of coherence support in writing with LLMs.
	3. Discussed the limitations of applying human teamwork concepts to AI collaboration.

**Result:** Findings indicate that while writing remains a non-linear cognitive process, LLMs introduce a trial-and-error methodology that requires more rigorous revision processes and highlights the need for coherence support.

**Limitations:** The review may not cover all relevant theories comprehensively and focuses primarily on professional contexts.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores significant distinctions between human-human and human-AI collaborative writing, suggesting a need for new design frameworks that account for the unique characteristics of LLMs.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we conduct a critical review of existing theories and frameworks on human-human collaborative writing to assess their relevance to the current human-AI paradigm in professional contexts, and draw seven insights along with design implications for human-AI collaborative writing tools. We found that, as LLMs nudge the writing process more towards an empirical "trial and error" process analogous to prototyping, the non-linear cognitive process of writing will stay the same, but more rigor will be required for revision methodologies. This shift would shed further light on the importance of coherence support, but the large language model (LLM)'s unprecedented semantic capabilities can bring novel approaches to this ongoing challenge. We argue that teamwork-related factors such as group awareness, consensus building and authorship - which have been central in human-human collaborative writing studies - should not apply to the human-AI paradigm due to excessive anthropomorphism. With the LLM's text generation capabilities becoming essentially indistinguishable from human-written ones, we are entering an era where, for the first time in the history of computing, we are engaging in collaborative writing with AI at workplaces on a daily basis. We aim to bring theoretical grounding and practical design guidance to the interaction designs of human-AI collaborative writing, with the goal of enhancing future human-AI writing software.

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a deep learning framework that combines visual and tactile data to accurately predict the perceptual attributes of haptic textures, significantly improving performance over single-modality methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Accurate prediction of haptic texture attributes is crucial for enhancing VR/AR experiences and robotic interactions with surfaces.

**Method:** A deep learning architecture utilizing a CNN-based autoencoder for visual feature learning and a ConvLSTM network for tactile data processing is developed to predict perceptual texture ratings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a multi-modal and multi-feature framework for haptic texture prediction

	3. Integration of visual and tactile data for enhanced predictive accuracy

**Result:** The proposed framework outperforms single-modality approaches, achieving lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) in texture attribute prediction.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The multi-modal framework demonstrates improved reliability and generalizability in predicting human perception of haptic textures, making it beneficial for VR/AR and robotics.

**Abstract:** Accurate prediction of perceptual attributes of haptic textures is essential for advancing VR and AR applications and enhancing robotic interaction with physical surfaces. This paper presents a deep learning-based multi-modal framework, incorporating visual and tactile data, to predict perceptual texture ratings by leveraging multi-feature inputs. To achieve this, a four-dimensional haptic attribute space encompassing rough-smooth, flat-bumpy, sticky-slippery, and hard-soft dimensions is first constructed through psychophysical experiments, where participants evaluate 50 diverse real-world texture samples. A physical signal space is subsequently created by collecting visual and tactile data from these textures. Finally, a deep learning architecture integrating a CNN-based autoencoder for visual feature learning and a ConvLSTM network for tactile data processing is trained to predict user-assigned attribute ratings. This multi-modal, multi-feature approach maps physical signals to perceptual ratings, enabling accurate predictions for unseen textures. To evaluate predictive accuracy, we employed leave-one-out cross-validation to rigorously assess the model's reliability and generalizability against several machine learning and deep learning baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework consistently outperforms single-modality approaches, achieving lower MAE and RMSE, highlighting the efficacy of combining visual and tactile modalities.

**Keywords:** physiological signals, misinformation detection, human belief, truth perception, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study examines physiological signals for classifying truthfulness of climate-related claims, revealing EDA's superiority over PPG in detecting truth perception, while highlighting the challenges in joint belief-veracity classification.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To advance misinformation detection systems by understanding physiological responses to false information.

**Method:** Conducted controlled experiments collecting EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated climate-related claims' truthfulness, leading to binary and four-class classification tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of EDA and PPG for truth classification
	2. Introduction of a four-class joint belief-veracity classification task
	3. Demonstration of the importance of multimodal approaches in misinformation detection.

**Result:** EDA signals outperformed PPG in detecting truth perception, but performance dropped significantly in joint belief-veracity tasks.

**Limitations:** The performance challenge in joint belief-veracity classification indicates further complexity in accurately modeling relationships between belief and veracity.

**Conclusion:** While physiological signals can indicate basic truth perception, modeling the interaction between belief and veracity is complex; multimodal approaches are recommended for better fake news detection.

**Abstract:** Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in understanding how people physically respond to misinformation and repeated exposure, using wearable technology for detection.

**Method:** A controlled experiment with 28 participants measuring skin conductance and peripheral blood flow using an EmotiBit sensor while evaluating statements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dataset for studying physiological responses to misinformation
	2. Demonstration of wearable sensors as a tool for belief detection
	3. Analysis of machine learning models for detecting misinformation responses

**Result:** The study analyzed 672 trials and achieved a maximum model accuracy of 67.83%, demonstrating that skin conductance is a more effective measure than PPG.

**Limitations:** Limited sample size of 28 participants and the need for further validation of results in diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** Wearable sensors could serve as effective, minimally intrusive tools for real-time detection of belief and exposure to misinformation, paving the way for user-aware systems.

**Abstract:** Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.

To address this, we incorporate an adversarial mechanic in the design of the dialogue-based serious game Cracking Aegis. Leveraging LLMs to simulate natural interactions, the game challenges players to impersonate characters and extract sensitive information from an AI agent, Aegis. A user study (n=22) revealed that players employed diverse deceptive linguistic strategies, including storytelling and emotional rapport, to manipulate Aegis. After playing, players reported connecting in-game scenarios with real-world privacy vulnerabilities, such as phishing and impersonation, and expressed intentions to strengthen privacy control, such as avoiding oversharing personal information with AI systems. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to simulate complex relational interactions in serious games, while demonstrating how an adversarial game strategy provides unique insights for designs for social good, particularly privacy protection.

### [14] [Missing Pieces: How Do Designs that Expose Uncertainty Longitudinally Impact Trust in AI Decision Aids? An In Situ Study of Gig Drivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06432)

*Rex Chen, Ruiyi Wang, Fei Fang, Norman Sadeh*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI decision aids, user trust, gig economy, uncertainty, longitudinal study

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how user trust in AI decision aids, specifically in gig driving contexts, evolves over time, focusing on the impact of uncertainty exposure in predictions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how AI decision aids can improve user trust over time by effectively communicating uncertainty in predictions, particularly in gig economy settings.

**Method:** A longitudinal mixed-methods study involving 51 gig drivers was conducted, measuring their trust in an AI-based scheduling recommendation tool over time and analyzing their interactions with it.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of trust dynamics in AI decision aids over time.
	2. Focus on the gig driving context for real-world applicability.
	3. Identification of task-aligned uncertainty framing as a mechanism to enhance trust.

**Result:** Results indicate that initial impressions of accuracy and continued interactions are pivotal in shaping trust, with task-aligned uncertainty framing enhancing trust by aiding decision-making processes.

**Limitations:** Limited sample size and scope to gig drivers; results may not generalize to other contexts or user groups.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for in situ examinations of AI decision aids, emphasizing that driver characteristics also affect trust in AI recommendations.

**Abstract:** Decision aids based on artificial intelligence (AI) induce a wide range of outcomes when they are deployed in uncertain environments. In this paper, we investigate how users' trust in recommendations from an AI decision aid is impacted over time by designs that expose uncertainty in predicted outcomes. Unlike previous work, we focus on gig driving - a real-world, repeated decision-making context. We report on a longitudinal mixed-methods study ($n=51$) where we measured gig drivers' trust as they interacted with an AI-based schedule recommendation tool. Our results show that participants' trust in the tool was shaped by both their first impressions of its accuracy and their longitudinal interactions with it; and that task-aligned framings of uncertainty improved trust by allowing participants to incorporate uncertainty into their decision-making processes. Additionally, we observed that trust depended on their characteristics as drivers, underscoring the need for more in situ studies of AI decision aids.

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates how Catholic Social Teaching values can be incorporated into social technology designs by comparing the interpretations of technologists and CST scholars.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the incorporation of religious values, specifically Catholic Social Teaching, into ethical technology design for social communications technologies amid societal concerns.

**Method:** Interviews were conducted with 24 technologists and 7 Catholic Social Teaching scholars to assess their interpretations of design patterns based on CST values.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates the role of religious values in technology design.
	2. Compares interpretations of values by technologists and scholars.
	3. Highlights the importance of understanding principles like subsidiarity in design.

**Result:** Technologists and CST scholars generally had similar interpretations of the values, although CST scholars better understood the principle of subsidiarity and believed moderation preserves human dignity more than technologists did.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for understanding diverse values in the design process for social technologies, which can enhance ethical design practices.

**Abstract:** HCI is increasingly taking inspiration from religious traditions as a basis for ethical technology designs. Such ethically-inspired designs can be especially important for social communications technologies, which are associated with numerous societal concerns. If religious values are to be incorporated into real-world designs, there may be challenges when designers work with values unfamiliar to them. Therefore, we investigate the difference in interpretations of values when they are translated to technology designs. To do so we studied design patterns that embody Catholic Social Teaching (CST). We interviewed 24 technologists and 7 CST scholars to assess how their understanding of how those values would manifest in social media designs. We found that for the most part the technologists responded similarly to the CST scholars. However, CST scholars had a better understanding of the principle of subsidiarity, and they believed moderation upheld human dignity more than the technologists did. We discuss the implications of our findings on the designs of social technologies and design processes at large.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Human-AI Collaboration, Large Language Models, User Interaction, Writing Workflows, Intent Analysis

**Relevance Score:** 9

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how users actively engage with LLMs in multi-turn interactions during complex writing workflows, going beyond simple classifications of task satisfaction.

**Method:** A large-scale analysis of interactions with two AI assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat, focusing on user behavior and writing intents.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs)
	2. Correlations between writing intents and user behaviors with LLMs
	3. Insights into user interaction patterns with AI assistants

**Result:** Identified key PATHs that account for most variations in user interactions and found correlations between writing intents and specific PATHs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest important implications for aligning LLMs with user needs based on how collaboration behaviors are shaped by their intents.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore, and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on LLM alignment.

To address this, we propose Concise-SAE, a training-free framework that improves instruction following by identifying and editing instruction-relevant neurons using only natural language instructions, without requiring labelled data. To thoroughly evaluate our method, we introduce FreeInstruct, a diverse and realistic benchmark of 1,212 examples that highlights the challenges of instruction following in narrative-rich settings. While initially motivated by complex narratives, Concise-SAE demonstrates state-of-the-art instruction adherence across varied tasks without compromising generation quality.

**Limitations:** The study emphasizes the need for human expert evaluation to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated content, indicating a limitation in full automation.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that while AI can generate legally relevant answers, expert evaluation is necessary to maintain legal validity, especially for important domains like taxation.

**Abstract:** This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law. The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais (CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics. Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency. These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes domains such as taxation.

**Conclusion:** This work provides a novel strategy for constructing Bayesian Networks via LLMs, introducing effective prompting strategies and establishing a baseline for LLM performance in this area.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines, including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting probabilistic knowledge.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a framework using large language models for reward decomposition to improve dialogue agents based on session-level feedback.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the alignment of dialogue agents using minimal feedback while reducing the need for manual reward shaping.

**Method:** The work introduces a reward decomposition framework leveraging a pretrained LLM for inferring local implicit rewards from global session feedback, with text-only and multimodal variants incorporating behavioral cues.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel reward decomposition framework for dialogue agents
	2. Utilization of both text-only and multimodal approaches for reward inference
	3. Demonstration of significant improvements in dialogue quality through effective reward modeling

**Result:** The proposed methods significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art reward decomposition methods in human evaluations of conversation quality.

**Limitations:** The reliance on a single session-level feedback signal may limit the diversity of training data.

**Conclusion:** The study suggests LLMs can effectively decompose rewards, simplifying the training process for dialogue generation without extensive human input.

**Abstract:** We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global, session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address global inequalities in knowledge production and the exclusion of Southern researchers from indexing services due to insufficient tools for citation network tracking.

**Method:** The authors assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations and evaluated various open-weight language models on their citation annotation accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a tool for citation annotation using open-weight language models
	2. Empirical evaluation demonstrating high accuracy for citation identification
	3. Potential to improve research indexing and knowledge dissemination, particularly in the Global South

**Result:** Today's language models achieved high accuracy in citation identification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the smallest model, Qwen3-0.6B, performs well in parsing citation fields effectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Developing robust citation parsing models can significantly enhance the fidelity of citation networks and improve research indexing and discovery, thereby supporting metascientific research.

**Abstract:** A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box, today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further metascientific research.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces FoVer, a method for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) using automatic error annotations to enhance reasoning tasks without costly human input.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the high cost of human annotation for training PRMs and the limited applicability of existing PRMs to math reasoning problems.

**Method:** FoVer employs formal verification tools such as Z3 and Isabelle to automatically annotate step-level error labels for tasks like formal logic and theorem proving, allowing for the creation of training datasets without human intervention.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FoVer for automatic dataset creation
	2. Demonstration of cross-task generalization in PRMs
	3. Provision of datasets, models, and tools for further research

**Result:** PRMs trained with FoVer show significant improvements in verification performance compared to baseline PRMs, achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art models across various reasoning benchmarks, including MATH and MMLU.

**Limitations:** The data synthesis is limited to tasks compatible with formal verification methods.

**Conclusion:** FoVer enables cross-task generalization for PRMs, demonstrating that automatic dataset creation can effectively enhance reasoning across diverse tasks.

**Abstract:** Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools, such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks. Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU, and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/FoVer.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current neural language models are opaque, making it challenging to verify or update specific knowledge. The research aims to improve how factual knowledge is handled in language models.

**Method:** The authors propose a new architecture that separates factual knowledge into internal model weights and an external database, using targeted lookups to enhance model performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Large Memory Language Models (LMLM)
	2. Separation of factual knowledge into internal and external storage
	3. Ability to perform targeted lookups for knowledge retrieval

**Result:** LMLMs show competitive performance to larger knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks while allowing for editable and verifiable external knowledge bases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of LMLMs represents a significant advancement in the management and interaction of language models with factual knowledge, enabling improved usability and flexibility.

**Abstract:** Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

**Motivation:** To understand the effectiveness of LLMs in human-AI collaborative decision-making, particularly in providing trustworthy and tailored explanations.

**Method:** Evaluation of five LLMs on their performance in solving and explaining \\sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLMs in a specific problem domain (Sudoku)
	2. Identification of explanation deficiencies in LLMs
	3. Insights into the role of explanations in collaborative decision-making

**Result:** One LLM showed limited success in solving puzzles, but none could provide explanations reflecting strategic reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLMs currently face significant challenges in becoming effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making due to inadequate explanation capabilities.

**Abstract:** The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

**Result:** The fine-tuned model showed improved accuracy in medical question answering tasks and provided better responses than the baseline model during benchmark evaluations.

**Limitations:** The model's performance may still vary with different medical terminologies and contexts not included in the training data.

**Conclusion:** Leveraging open-access online data has proven effective in enriching small language models for medical applications, showing promise for future Persian medical AI solutions in resource-limited settings.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for resource-constrained environments.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to demonstrate that causal interpretability can improve understanding of the abstract mechanisms LLMs use, impacting linguistic theories.

**Method:** Experiments based on Distributed Interchange Interventions were conducted to analyze English filler-gap dependency constructions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Causal interpretability methods can enhance linguistic analysis of LLMs.
	2. LLMs reveal previously overlooked factors in linguistic constructions.
	3. Demonstration of empirical focus on specific syntactic phenomena.

**Result:** The results show that LLMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions, revealing overlooked factors that could influence linguistic theory.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mechanistic analyses of LLMs can advance linguistic theory by highlighting new influences on filler-gap constructions.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall, these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push linguistic theory forward.

	2. Evidence of SLMEval achieving better correlation with human evaluations compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
	3. Significant reduction in evaluation costs compared to existing methods.

**Result:** SLMEval demonstrates strong correlation with human evaluations, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.57, and reduces evaluation costs by 5-30 times compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SLMEval provides an efficient and effective means of calibrating language model evaluations to better reflect human judgments in diverse tasks.

**Abstract:** The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.   In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition, SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated evaluators such as G-eval.

**TL;DR:** LAGO is a new method for improving few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks by modeling language similarities, enhancing the security of multilingual NLP systems.

**Read time:** 7 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems by improving few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks.

**Method:** A graph-based constrained distributed optimization framework that integrates syntactic and lexical similarity as edge constraints for collaborative parameter learning across languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces LAGO for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks.
	2. Models linguistic relationships through a graph-based framework.
	3. Demonstrates substantial improvements in attack transferability.

**Result:** LAGO improves attack transferability by 10-20% in Rouge-L score across various languages and embedding models compared to baseline approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework highlights the importance of language similarity in enhancing the transferability of inversion attacks and calls for attention to privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

**Abstract:** We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

*Yash Saxena, Anpur Padia, Mandar S Chaudhary, Kalpa Gunaratna, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Manas Gaur*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Explainability, Adversarial Robustness

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** METEORA is a novel method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation that improves selection and verification of evidence using rationales, thereby enhancing explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Traditional RAG pipelines lack explainability, robustness, and rely heavily on similarity-based retrieval which may not perform well in adversarial conditions.

**Method:** METEORA replaces re-ranking with a rationale-driven selection approach in two stages: generating rationales using a preference-tuned LLM and selecting evidence chunks based on local relevance, adaptive cutoff, and context expansion.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a rationale-driven selection mechanism in RAG
	2. Significant improvement in generation accuracy and robustness against adversarial content
	3. Consistent use of rationales for evidence selection and verification, enhancing explainability.

**Result:** METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% and reduces the number of chunks used by about 50% compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also enhances resilience to adversarial attacks, with an F1 score improvement from 0.10 to 0.44.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework enables explainable and interpretable evidence flow, effectively addressing issues of previous RAG approaches while demonstrating improved performance across multiple datasets.

**Abstract:** Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** reinforcement learning, incentive training, language models, NOVER, fine-tuning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces NOVER, a novel reinforcement learning framework that eliminates the need for external verifiers, instead relying on standard supervised fine-tuning data to enhance language model performance in various text-to-text tasks.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to address the limitations of current incentive training methods in reinforcement learning, particularly their dependence on external verifiers, which restricts their applicability in domains lacking such resources.

**Method:** The authors propose a framework called NOVER (NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning) that utilizes standard supervised fine-tuning data, allowing for the application of incentive training without requiring external verification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NOVER, a framework that avoids the need for external verifiers in reinforcement learning.
	2. Demonstration of superior performance compared to large reasoning models using standard fine-tuning data.
	3. Exploration of new optimization possibilities for large language models through inverse incentive training.

**Result:** NOVER demonstrates a 7.7% improvement over a model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models like DeepSeek R1 671B, showcasing its effectiveness and potential.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that NOVER not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods but also opens new avenues for optimizing large language models, including inverse incentive training.

**Abstract:** Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language models, such as inverse incentive training.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes user interactions with large language models (LLMs) during writing tasks, identifying collaborative behaviors known as Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how users actively engage and collaborate with LLMs in writing workflows, moving beyond passive output acceptance.

**Method:** A large-scale analysis of user interactions with popular AI assistants, categorizing behaviors into specific PATHs based on multi-turn interactions during writing tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) from user interactions.
	2. Demonstrated the correlation between writing intents and user collaboration behaviors with LLMs.
	3. Provided a novel framework for understanding collaborative behaviors in AI-assisted writing.

**Result:** Identified a small group of PATHs that explain most of the variation in user-LLM interactions, correlating specific writing intents with distinct collaboration behaviors.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of user intent in shaping interactions with LLMs and have implications for LLM alignment strategies.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore, and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address gaps in the ethical evaluation of generative large language models, particularly regarding diversity of languages and models.

**Method:** A comprehensive ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language models was conducted, analyzing robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness in both English and Turkish.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Broad ethical evaluation of 29 open-source LLMs
	2. Analysis of performance across different languages
	3. Identification of key ethical performance trends based on model size

**Result:** The study found that while many models prioritize safety and fairness, reliability remains a concern; larger models generally show better ethical performance, with Gemma and Qwen performing the best.

**Limitations:** Limited to the open-source models evaluated and may not generalize to proprietary models.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights that ethical evaluations can be effectively performed regardless of language, and underscores the need for continuous improvement in model reliability.

**Abstract:** Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects: Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage, and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those evaluated.

**Motivation:** To investigate how NLP research influences both the academic community and broader public domains over time, with a focus on various NLP topics.

**Method:** Citations from research articles and external sources (patents, media, policy documents) were analyzed to assess the consumption of NLP topics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of NLP research impacts over several decades
	2. Identification of alignment and divergence between academic and external consumption of NLP topics
	3. Insights on public interest in societal implications versus academic discourse

**Result:** Language modeling demonstrates the highest internal and external influence, while linguistic foundations have lower impacts. Topics like ethics, bias, and fairness attract significant attention in policy documents but are less cited in academic literature.

**Limitations:** May not capture the entire spectrum of NLP influence due to the focus on top-tier conferences alone.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a mismatch between academic focus and societal needs, particularly regarding ethical implications of NLP.

**Abstract:** We investigate the impacts of NLP research published in top-tier conferences (i.e., ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL) from 1979 to 2024. By analyzing citations from research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations. Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging more with the societal implications of NLP models.

**Motivation:** To assess whether smaller language models can effectively handle text classification tasks amidst challenges such as prompt quality and GPU resource limitations.

**Method:** A comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based models, applied in real-world scenarios like email classification and legal document categorization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning for smaller models
	2. Focus on practical industrial applications
	3. Insights into VRAM utilization for model deployment

**Result:** The study highlights the performance and efficiency of smaller transformer models in text classification tasks while analyzing their VRAM utilization.

**Limitations:** Limited exploration of a wider range of models and methodologies.

**Conclusion:** Smaller language models can be deployed effectively for text classification, but their performance is influenced by prompt quality and requires efficient VRAM management.

**Abstract:** With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus, the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest. However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios, including email classification, legal document categorization, and the classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM) utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and application of compact models in industrial settings.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the need for a comprehensive dataset that aids in understanding and detecting ideological bias in political news articles, promoting the development of explainable NLP systems in the context of political discourse.

**Method:** The authors implemented a structured annotation pipeline involving crowdworkers to label articles based on their sentiment toward political parties, alongside conducting various analyses on inter-annotator agreement and misalignment with source bias. They also employed a GPT-4o model to simulate annotation for comparative analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BiasLab dataset for ideological bias in political news articles.
	2. Comparison between human annotations and GPT-4o simulated annotations.
	3. Defined modeling tasks to further explore explainable bias detection.

**Result:** The dataset shows quantifiable inter-annotator agreement and reveals challenges in bias detection, specifically noting mirrored asymmetries in misclassifying right-leaning content. Baseline performance is reported for two modeling tasks: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification.

**Limitations:** The dataset is limited to 300 articles and the findings might not generalize across all types of political news or other contexts.

**Conclusion:** BiasLab offers rich annotations that enhance interpretability in bias detection and provides essential resources for future research in explainable AI and human-in-the-loop systems.

**Abstract:** We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated 900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias, and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection. BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world settings.

**Keywords:** tokenization, temporal reasoning, large language models, benchmarks, fragmentation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This work introduces a new metric to measure date fragmentation in tokenization, releases a benchmark for temporal reasoning tasks, and analyzes how LLMs reconstruct date fragments for better reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Tokenizers often fragment calendar dates into parts that obscure their structure, negatively impacting temporal reasoning in NLP models.

**Method:** The authors propose a date fragmentation ratio metric to assess tokenization fidelity for dates and introduce DateAugBench, which includes 6500 examples across three types of temporal reasoning tasks. They use layer-wise probing and causal attention analysis to investigate LLM behavior in date reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the date fragmentation ratio metric
	2. Release of DateAugBench for evaluating temporal reasoning
	3. Identification of a unique reasoning path in LLMs for assembling date fragments

**Result:** Excessive token fragmentation correlates with up to 10-point accuracy drops on certain date tasks. Larger models show rapid improvements in reconstructing date fragments for reasoning.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on tokenization issues and their impact on LLMs; may not address all aspects of temporal reasoning in NLP.

**Conclusion:** LLMs reconstruct fragments differently from humans, suggesting a distinct reasoning process in date handling that could be improved with better tokenization strategies.

**Abstract:** Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day).

**Motivation:** To improve patient engagement in bariatric and metabolic surgery by addressing healthcare disparities and providing timely, evidence-based information.

**Method:** Development of bRAGgen, an adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model that updates real-time medical evidence based on confidence thresholds, and the creation of bRAGq, a curated dataset of bariatric surgery questions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of bRAGgen for real-time integration of medical evidence.
	2. Creation of bRAGq, the first large-scale dataset for bariatric surgery questions.
	3. Demonstration of bRAGgen's superior performance in clinical response generation.

**Result:** bRAGgen shows significantly improved performance over existing models in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses during evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** bRAGgen is a promising tool for enhancing the delivery of evidence-based information in bariatric surgery, thereby improving patient outcomes and engagement.

**Abstract:** While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions, validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review. Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Pruning LVLMs often degrades safety performance, necessitating methods to restore safety in compressed models.

**Method:** HSR quantifies the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifies critical heads, and selectively restores neurons to realign safety hierarchically from attention heads to neuron levels.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR) for LVLMs.
	2. Quantitative assessment of attention heads' contributions to safety.
	3. First explicit focus on safety restoration post-pruning in LVLMs.

**Result:** HSR consistently achieved notable improvements in safety performance across various models and pruning strategies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HSR is the first approach to explicitly focus on restoring safety in pruned LVLMs, demonstrating effectiveness in ensuring safety in resource-constrained environments.

**Abstract:** With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve structured output generation in information extraction by leveraging the inherent structural advantages of multiple programming languages.

**Method:** The proposed MPL framework incorporates various programming languages (such as C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning phase and introduces the function-prompt method with virtual running for more effective simulation of code-style inputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MPL framework for using multiple programming languages in information extraction.
	2. Development of the function-prompt method with virtual running for better code-style input simulation.
	3. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrating MPL's effectiveness across various datasets.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that MPL effectively enhances information extraction across multiple datasets compared to existing approaches that primarily focus on Python.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MPL shows promise for advancing information extraction by incorporating diverse programming languages; the released code will support further research in this area.

**Abstract:** Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis. We have released our code for future research.

**Motivation:** To advance LLM evaluation in Korean by addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that lack linguistic depth.

**Method:** KoBALT includes expert-curated multiple-choice questions covering various linguistic domains, ensuring minimal n-gram overlap with standard corpora to reduce data contamination.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Evaluation of 20 LLMs shows significant performance disparities, with general accuracy peaking at 61%, revealing strengths in semantics and weaknesses in phonology and morphology.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** KoBALT provides an effective framework for evaluating linguistic competence in Korean language models, validating its use through correlation with human judgments.

**Abstract:** We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

*Yue Zhou, Barbara Di Eugenio*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** LLMs, demographic bias, solution veracity, educational evaluation, human value alignment

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates biases in LLMs regarding the association of solution veracity with demographics, revealing significant disparities in how different demographic groups are evaluated across various tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the biases exhibited by LLMs in how they attribute solution correctness to different demographics, particularly in educational contexts.

**Method:** Experiments were conducted on five human value-aligned LLMs across mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems to identify biases in solution attribution and evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of Attribution Bias and Evaluation Bias in LLM assessments
	2. Demonstration of racial stereotypical color assignments in LLM visualizations
	3. Implications for the deployment of LLMs in education and evaluation contexts

**Result:** LLMs show a bias in attributing correct solutions more frequently to certain demographic groups, notably attributing fewer correct solutions to African-American groups in math and coding, and displaying preference against Asian authors in writing evaluations.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on only five LLMs and a limited set of tasks, which may not fully represent the diversity of LLM behaviors.

**Conclusion:** Demographic bias in LLMs is complex and pervasive, indicating significant implications for their use in educational and evaluative settings.

**Abstract:** Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models' reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel generation-based evaluation paradigm for machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) using decoder-only large language models (LLMs), which outperforms existing direct scoring methods and reference-free metrics.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current machine translation quality estimation methods using LLMs often lack correlation with human judgments; this paper aims to improve evaluation accuracy.

**Method:** The authors propose a generation-based approach where decoder-only LLMs create high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using sentence embeddings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a generation-based evaluation paradigm
	2. Extensive empirical evaluation of MTQE methods across multiple LLMs and language pairs
	3. Demonstration of improved correlation with human judgments compared to standard methods.

**Result:** The method shows improved performance over baseline direct scoring and external reference-free metrics across 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs in extensive evaluations.

**Limitations:** The study focuses solely on 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs, which may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings advocate for hybrid evaluation techniques that merge fluent generation with precise semantic evaluation for better translation quality assessment.

**Abstract:** Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE, covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study investigates how positional bias in large language models varies across five languages, revealing its model-driven nature and implications for prompt engineering.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the relationship between positional bias in language models and linguistic diversity, addressing gaps in knowledge regarding how models vary across different languages.

**Method:** A cross-linguistic study analyzing positional bias in five languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, Vietnamese) and its interaction with model uncertainty, syntax, and prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of model-driven positional bias with language-specific variations
	2. Impact of explicit positional guidance on accuracy
	3. Insights into dominance of word order in free-word-order languages

**Result:** Positional bias is model-specific, with Qwen2.5-7B showing a preference for late positions, counter to expectations; explicit positional guidance lowers accuracy; aligning context with bias increases entropy without improving accuracy; LLMs influence word order in free-word-order languages.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on five languages; further research is needed to explore additional languages and contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the complexity of positional bias and its non-uniform impact across languages, suggesting a need for reconsideration in prompt-engineering methods.

**Abstract:** Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty, syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g., correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages, undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in free-word-order languages like Hindi.

### [45] [Distilling the Implicit Multi-Branch Structure in LLMs' Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16142)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Distillation, Meta-reasoning, Neuroscience

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces RLKD, a reinforcement learning-based distillation framework that improves the reasoning ability of smaller LLMs by effectively capturing the multi-branch reasoning structure from teacher models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing distillation methods reduce complex reasoning paths into flat sequences, losing critical multi-branch structures necessary for authentic reasoning.

**Method:** The proposed RLKD uses a Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM) to convert reasoning paths into meta-reasoning-solving steps, providing rewards based on structural alignment between student and teacher models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel reinforcement learning-based distillation method (RLKD) for LLMs.
	2. Develops a Generative Structure Reward Model that encapsulates multi-branch reasoning.
	3. Demonstrates improved reasoning capabilities in student models with minimal training data.

**Result:** RLKD achieves superior performance over standard supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning pipelines, even with limited training data.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on a specific distillation approach and may require further exploration of its applicability across various models and tasks.

**Conclusion:** By enabling student models to absorb rich reasoning structures, RLKD significantly enhances their reasoning capabilities compared to traditional methods.

**Abstract:** Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the EduBench benchmark for educational language models

**Conclusion:** The work lays a practical foundation for developing and evaluating education-focused language models, with data and code made available for the community.

**Abstract:** As large language models continue to advance, their application in educational contexts remains underexplored and under-optimized. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover 12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data are released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/EduBench.

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses KNN-SSD, an algorithm that enhances the domain generalizability of Self-Speculative Decoding for accelerating large language models' inference.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the sensitivity of Self-Speculative Decoding to domain shifts, which impacts acceleration performance in language model inference.

**Method:** KNN-SSD employs K-Nearest Neighbor search to dynamically select appropriate skipped layers based on the input domain, avoiding the need for additional parameters or retraining.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of KNN-SSD algorithm
	2. Significant speedups in inference performance
	3. Enhanced domain generalizability for LLMs

**Result:** KNN-SSD achieves speedups of 1.3x-1.6x in large language model inference across various tasks, improving upon traditional Self-Speculative Decoding.

**Limitations:** Sensitivity to domain shifts remains a challenge, but KNN-SSD mitigates this issue.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of KNN-SSD makes Self-Speculative Decoding more robust to domain shifts, establishing a more effective acceleration strategy for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably, Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training. Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in LLM inference.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine if LLMs can replicate individual differences in cognitive tasks and understand their limitations in simulating human behavior.

**Method:** The researchers evaluated 34 LLM configurations, altering prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and model type, and compared outputs from these models to responses from 106 human participants in a phonemic fluency task.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLMs in a cognitive task context
	2. Analysis of model configurations affecting outputs
	3. Insights into the differences in retrieval structure between humans and LLMs

**Result:** Some LLM configurations, particularly Claude 3.7 Sonnet, reflected human averages and preferences, yet none matched the diversity of human responses, with LLM outputs being less varied and more structured.

**Limitations:** LLMs did not reproduce the diversity of human responses in the phonemic fluency task, indicating their limitations in simulating human-like variability.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that LLMs have significant limitations in simulating human cognition and behavior, as they fail to capture human variability in cognitive tasks effectively.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34 model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants. While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the conditions under which LLMs acknowledge their errors is crucial for improving their reliability in generating factual information.

**Method:** The study constructs model-specific datasets to evaluate LLMs' retraction behavior and conducts steering experiments to analyze the influence of internal beliefs on retraction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition and analysis of LLM retraction behavior
	2. Demonstration of the causal influence of internal beliefs on retraction
	3. Validation of supervised fine-tuning's effectiveness in improving retraction performance

**Result:** LLMs retract incorrect answers infrequently, and this behavior is influenced by their internal belief in the correctness of prior generated answers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Supervised fine-tuning can improve the retraction performance of LLMs by enabling them to learn more accurate internal beliefs about their answers.

**Abstract:** Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction. In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping the model learn more accurate internal beliefs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for better understanding of health information and the limitations of current generative AI models in maintaining crucial details during simplification.

**Method:** The study involved simplifying 50 health information texts using gpt-4-0613 and comparing five approaches to detect and insert missing elements, evaluated through cosine similarity and ROUGE scores.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluated multiple approaches for detecting missing information in simplified health texts.
	2. Demonstrated the efficacy of adding all missing entities in improving text regeneration.
	3. Identified limitations of current tools in ranking missing entities.

**Result:** Adding all missing entities significantly improved the quality of the regenerated text compared to other methods.

**Limitations:** Current tools can identify missing elements but do not provide valuable rankings for better reconstruction.

**Conclusion:** Enhancing generative AI models to effectively identify and rank missing information can lead to better comprehension of simplified health texts.

**Abstract:** Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text, evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities, 2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613, and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities. We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite advancements in language models, fact recall remains a significant challenge that current training strategies struggle to address effectively.

**Method:** The authors analyze the influence of training strategies on model parameters using cross-task gradient trace to identify shared parameters that are influenced by both fact-storing and fact-recalling examples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of cross-task gradient trace for identifying shared parameters
	2. Empirical evidence showing mixed training improves fact recall
	3. Insights into the relationship between training strategy and model parameter shaping.

**Result:** The analysis reveals that mixed training leads to a larger and more centralized set of shared parameters, enhancing LMs' ability to generalize factual knowledge across tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** These findings indicate that understanding the emergence of shared parameters is critical for improving language models' fact retrieval capabilities.

**Abstract:** Fact recall, the ability of language models (LMs) to retrieve specific factual knowledge, remains a challenging task despite their impressive general capabilities. Common training strategies often struggle to promote robust recall behavior with two-stage training, which first trains a model with fact-storing examples (e.g., factual statements) and then with fact-recalling examples (question-answer pairs), tending to encourage rote memorization rather than generalizable fact retrieval. In contrast, mixed training, which jointly uses both types of examples, has been empirically shown to improve the ability to recall facts, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how these training strategies affect how model parameters are shaped during training and how these differences relate to their ability to recall facts. We introduce cross-task gradient trace to identify shared parameters, those strongly influenced by both fact-storing and fact-recalling examples. Our analysis on synthetic fact recall datasets with the Llama-3.2B and Pythia-2.8B models reveals that mixed training encouraging a larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. These findings suggest that the emergence of parameters may play a key role in enabling LMs to generalize factual knowledge across task formulations.

**Motivation:** The need to control LLMs effectively in open-ended generation settings, while maintaining quality and reliability in their outputs.

**Method:** Using sparse autoencoders to create interpretable, sparse latent representations, followed by training linear classifiers to pinpoint relevant dimensions in these representations and learning steering vectors constrained to those dimensions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a supervised steering approach for LLMs
	2. Employs sparse autoencoders for interpretable representations
	3. Demonstrates high success rates with minimal quality loss in steering tasks.

**Result:** The proposed method achieves higher success rates in steering tasks, such as sentiment and truthfulness, with little to no degradation in output quality as compared to existing approaches.

**Limitations:** The performance in highly complex tasks may still need further investigation and validation.

**Conclusion:** A small subspace of dimensions is sufficient for effective steering, leading to targeted interventions in LLM behavior.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings. This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations. Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace, optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment, truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods. Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

**Result:** BPMs are found in 5% to 10% of personal narratives and tweets, and their usage varies over time and geography. Text with BPMs is more emotionally charged, and there is a strong correlation between body-related language and poorer health outcomes.

**Limitations:** Limited to English text on online platforms; may not generalize to other languages or contexts.

**Conclusion:** Investigating body-part related words may provide insight into the intersection of NLP, affective sciences, and human wellbeing.

**Abstract:** This paper is the first investigation of the connection between emotion, embodiment, and everyday language in a large sample of natural language data. We created corpora of body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text (blog posts and tweets). This includes a subset featuring human annotations for the emotions of the person whose body part is mentioned in the text. We show that BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets (~5% to 10% of posts include BPMs) and that their usage patterns vary markedly by time and %geographic location. Using word-emotion association lexicons and our annotated data, we show that text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when the BPM is not explicitly used to describe a physical reaction to the emotion in the text. Finally, we discover a strong and statistically significant correlation between body-related language and a variety of poorer health outcomes. In sum, we argue that investigating the role of body-part related words in language can open up valuable avenues of future research at the intersection of NLP, the affective sciences, and the study of human wellbeing.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the effectiveness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) under a zero-shot paradigm, proposing strategies to improve their performance through in-context learning configurations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, which is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence capabilities.

**Method:** The paper extends the zero-shot paradigm to in-context learning (ICL) by investigating and optimizing three key factors: retrieval, presentation, and distribution of demonstrations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of optimized strategies for in-context learning in MLLMs
	2. Demonstrated significant performance improvements in MSA tasks
	3. Identification and counteraction of MLLMs' sentimental predictive bias

**Result:** The proposed strategies improved average accuracy by 15.9% on six MSA datasets compared to the zero-shot paradigm and by 11.2% against the random ICL baseline.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MLLMs can perceive sentiments effectively when equipped with optimized in-context learning strategies, overcoming inherent predictive biases.

**Abstract:** The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability. Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval, presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized. A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL baseline.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for children's speech, addressing the challenges and effectiveness of LLMs in error correction in conversational datasets.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Accurate transcription of children's speech by ASR systems is challenging, and recent advances in LLMs offer potential solutions. However, their application to children's conversational scenarios is not well-explored.

**Method:** Experiments were conducted on two children's conversational speech datasets using zero-shot and fine-tuned ASR outputs. The study analyzes LLM performance in correcting ASR errors across different output types.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in correcting ASR errors in children's speech.
	2. Identified challenges in applying LLMs to improve ASR performance in particular scenarios.
	3. Provided insights into the performance of zero-shot versus fine-tuned ASR outputs when corrected by LLMs.

**Result:** LLMs were found to effectively correct zero-shot ASR outputs and certain fine-tuned ASR outputs, but struggled with contextual information and autoregressive ASR outputs.

**Limitations:** Challenges remain in improving ASR performance with contextual information and fine-tuned autoregressive models.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs show promise in enhancing ASR for children's speech, challenges remain in their application particularly with contextual information and specific ASR models.

**Abstract:** Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress, but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces MIDAS, a dataset for studying idiom processing in multilingual settings, and evaluates how large language models (LLMs) handle idioms.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of understanding of idiom processing mechanisms in large language models, especially in multilingual contexts.

**Method:** The authors created the MIDAS dataset containing idioms in six languages with their meanings, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation on LLMs' performance in processing these idioms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MIDAS dataset for idioms in six languages
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability
	3. Insights into the hybrid approach of LLMs in understanding idioms

**Result:** LLMs use a hybrid approach for idiom processing, combining memorization with contextual cues and reasoning, particularly for compositional idioms.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Idiom understanding in LLMs involves both knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

**Abstract:** Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

**TL;DR:** A study examining biases in large language models (LLMs) when evaluating code correctness, revealing their vulnerability to superficial variations in functionally correct code.

**Read time:** 26 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Growing use of LLMs for code evaluation raises concerns about their ability to fairly assess semantically equivalent code with superficial variations.

**Method:** The study defines six types of potential bias in code evaluation and empirically tests multiple LLMs across five programming languages to observe their performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comprehensive study on biases in LLM code evaluation
	2. Definition of six types of potential bias
	3. Demonstration of LLMs' vulnerability to scoring biases across multiple programming languages

**Result:** All tested LLM judges exhibited susceptibility to both positive and negative biases, affecting their scoring accuracy.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on certain programming languages and LLMs; further research needed with additional languages and models.

**Conclusion:** There is a critical need for more robust code evaluation methods to ensure fairness and accuracy in LLM-driven assessments.

**Abstract:** With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations. While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical, unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases, resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work provides the first systematic exploration of low-resource personalization strategies for jargon detection, demonstrating a practical path for user-adaptive NLP applications.

**Abstract:** Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

**TL;DR:** MuseRAG is an automated system for originality scoring of creative ideas using LLMs and a retrieval-augmented generation framework.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To automate the labor-intensive and error-prone process of measuring originality of creative ideas based on their rarity in a population.

**Method:** The MuseRAG pipeline uses large language models to retrieve similar prior ideas and evaluate new ideas for originality, calculating frequency-based metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the MuseRAG system for originality scoring
	2. Combination of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for creativity assessment
	3. Empirical validation across five datasets showing high alignment with human judgments

**Result:** MuseRAG matches human annotators in clustering structure and scoring, demonstrating strong validity across multiple datasets.

**Limitations:** The automated system may still be influenced by biases in the training data of LLMs and requires ongoing validation across diverse contexts.

**Conclusion:** This method enables scalable originality scoring in creativity research, aligning with human intent and sensitivity.

**Abstract:** An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive, error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated, psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring. Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea, the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI = 0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive, human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces LIFEBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to follow explicit length instructions. It assesses 26 widely-used LLMs across diverse tasks and languages, revealing significant limitations in meeting length requirements.

**Read time:** 30 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' performance in following explicit length instructions, as current benchmarks focus mainly on the quality of generated content.

**Method:** The study creates the Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) consisting of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in English and Chinese, testing various specified lengths.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LIFEBench as a comprehensive benchmark for length instruction following
	2. Evaluation and analysis of 26 popular LLMs across different lengths
	3. Discovery of a performance decline in LLMs as instructed lengths increase.

**Result:** The evaluation indicates that while LLMs perform reasonably well with short-length instructions, their ability declines sharply as the length increases, with most failing to achieve vendor-claimed maximum lengths.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on length instructions; other performance metrics and aspects may not be covered.

**Conclusion:** LIFEBench highlights critical limitations in LLMs' capability to follow length instructions, providing insights for future improvements in model design and evaluation.

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Align-GRAG is a novel dual alignment framework for enhancing graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language models by optimizing the use of graph structures and improving retrieval efficiency.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs), issues such as hallucinations and outdated information persist. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) seeks to mitigate these problems by integrating external knowledge.

**Method:** The Align-GRAG framework retrieves a subgraph of nodes and edges, utilizes an Aligner for dual alignment optimization of the graph encoder and LLM reasoning, applying KL divergence loss and contrastive loss to prune irrelevant information and create a unified semantic representation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes Align-GRAG framework for dual alignment in graph-based RAG
	2. Implements a novel Aligner for optimizing graph encoding with LLM reasoning
	3. Demonstrates effectiveness on the GraphQA benchmark across multiple tasks

**Result:** Experiments on the GraphQA benchmark showed that Align-GRAG effectively improves performance in tasks related to common sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning compared to traditional methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Align-GRAG enhances the integration of graph structures and LLMs for more accurate and contextually relevant answers, addressing key retrieval challenges in graph-based RAG systems.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes (especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2) The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning) validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon accepted.

**Motivation:** To explore the potential security vulnerabilities introduced by stronger reasoning abilities in Large Reasoning Models and to develop effective jailbreak methods.

**Method:** The authors propose SEAL, which uses a stacked encryption pipeline with multiple ciphers and dynamic strategies to overwhelm the reasoning capabilities of LRMs and evade safety mechanisms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack for LRMs
	2. Utilization of a stacked encryption approach to target reasoning capabilities
	3. Development of dynamic strategies to prevent countermeasures from LRMs.

**Result:** SEAL shows a high attack success rate of 80.8% on GPT o4-mini, significantly outperforming existing jailbreak methods by 27.2%.

**Limitations:** The paper contains examples of inappropriate, offensive, and harmful content; further exploration into the ethical implications may be necessary.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach demonstrates that it is possible to effectively bypass the reasoning safeguards in LRMs using advanced encryption techniques.

**Abstract:** Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length, order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of 80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin of 27.2%.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the diversity of language model responses which is essential for creative tasks and self-improvement, while addressing the bias towards shorter outputs in current diversity metrics.

**Method:** Diverse-NS utilizes a length-controlled self-learning framework to generate and filter preference data that balances diversity, quality, and length, using only 3,000 preference pairs for training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Diverse-NS framework for length-controlled diversity training.
	2. Demonstration of improved diversity metrics on various creative tasks.
	3. Finding that smaller models can effectively teach diversity to larger models.

**Result:** The application of Diverse-NS to models like LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family shows a significant improvement in lexical and semantic diversity across various creative tasks with minimal impact on quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By explicitly addressing length bias, Diverse-NS allows language models to produce more diverse and expressive outputs, even enabling smaller models to teach diversity effectively to larger models.

**Abstract:** Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation, open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization, systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled self-learning framework that improves response diversity while maintaining length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family, Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward more diverse and expressive outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of unintended content retention in large language models and evaluate the trade-offs in knowledge unlearning.

**Method:** The authors revisit existing localized unlearning approaches and conduct controlled experiments to assess the causal relationship between parameter updates and unlearning efficacy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Thorough evaluation of localized unlearning methods
	2. Controlled experiments that challenge assumptions about parameter locality in unlearning
	3. Insights into the complexities of unlearning knowledge in large language models.

**Result:** The experiments show that the parameters required for effective unlearning are not well-defined, disputing the assumption that parameter locality is key to knowledge removal.

**Limitations:** Does not address the practical application of findings in specific language models or architectures.

**Conclusion:** Effective knowledge unlearning in language models cannot solely rely on modifying local parameters, as the necessary parameters for unlearning are not consistently identifiable.

**Abstract:** Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning. In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches. We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge removal.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of integrating linguistic and cognitive insights into multi-modal reasoning strategies for better sarcasm detection.

**Abstract:** Interpreting figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs presents unique challenges, often requiring task-specific fine-tuning and extensive reasoning steps. However, current Chain-of-Thought approaches do not efficiently leverage the same cognitive processes that enable humans to identify sarcasm. We present IRONIC, an in-context learning framework that leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across different baselines.

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of language models by utilizing a systematic approach to track learning behaviors and reduce errors during fine-tuning.

**Method:** The Transformer Copilot framework involves a Piloting model that learns traditionally and a Copilot model designed to rectify inference based on a Mistake Log that tracks errors and learning signals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Mistake Log for tracking learning behaviors
	2. Design of the Copilot model for logits rectification
	3. Development of a joint training and fused inference paradigm for enhanced model performance

**Result:** Experiments show that the Transformer Copilot improves model performance by up to 34.5% on 12 diverse benchmarks, with only marginal computational overhead and strong scalability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework provides a novel approach to refining language model performance, blending traditional learning with innovative error tracking and correction mechanisms.

**Abstract:** Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the advancements in language models, there's a need to evaluate their cognitive characteristics, particularly in predicting language processing behaviors and responses.

**Method:** The study extracts production variables such as speech reductions and prosodic prominences from spontaneous speech corpora, testing models trained on various pretraining datasets to see their predictive accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of utilizing high-quality speech corpora as benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models.

**Abstract:** The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing, especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral (e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses) variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper, we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables (speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as benchmarks for LLMs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current LLM-based machine translation evaluation methods struggle with accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity, highlighting the need for improved evaluation frameworks.

**Method:** We developed HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework that utilizes the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) error typology for granular error evaluation, incorporating strategies like self-reflection and agent discussions to minimize hallucinations.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that HiMATE provides a more human-aligned evaluation of machine translation, effectively addressing past limitations in error detection and severity assessment.

**Abstract:** The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper, we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information. Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiMATE-Anony.

**Conclusion:** This method indirectly increases the effective context length of LLMs, enabling better reasoning and planning.

**Abstract:** Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance. While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information. This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6 percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the impracticality of large language models in resource-constrained environments due to high latency and energy consumption.

**Method:** Token-wise Distillation (ToDi) combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Token-wise Distillation (ToDi) method
	2. Adaptive combination of Forward KL and Reverse KL divergences
	3. Consistent outperforming of existing distillation baselines across benchmarks.

**Result:** ToDi outperforms existing distillation methods on instruction-following benchmarks and shows improved efficiency and effectiveness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ToDi represents a significant advancement in knowledge distillation by focusing on token-level discrepancies for better model performance in practical applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption. Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

**TL;DR:** PMPO is a new framework for prompt optimization that improves LLM performance without costly sampling or human evaluation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To provide a more scalable, efficient, and practical method for optimizing prompts in LLMs without the limitations of existing methods that rely on expensive output generation and evaluations.

**Method:** PMPO uses token-level cross-entropy loss to assess prompt quality, identifying and rewriting low-quality segments by minimizing loss over examples without the need for output sampling or human input.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a unified framework for prompt optimization using token-level cross-entropy loss.
	2. Eliminates the need for output sampling and human evaluation during the optimization process.
	3. Shows consistent performance improvement across multiple tasks and model sizes.

**Result:** PMPO outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest accuracy on BBH and significant performance improvements on other tasks like GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, as well as a 19-point increase in AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PMPO demonstrates a highly effective and efficient approach to prompt optimization that is applicable across various models and tasks.

**Abstract:** Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However, existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability, especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO (Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH, performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability.

**TL;DR:** CLEAR introduces a multi-dimensional framework for evaluating radiology reports with a focus on attribute-level comparisons and clinical relevance.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing metrics are insufficient for effectively evaluating the quality of radiology reports, lacking detailed assessments of nuanced clinical differences.

**Method:** CLEAR is a framework that evaluates radiology reports by examining their accuracy in identifying medical conditions and descriptively assessing these conditions across five attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive location, and recommendation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the CLEAR framework for radiology report evaluation
	2. Introduction of attribute-level comparisons across five key diagnostic attributes
	3. Creation of CLEAR-Bench dataset annotated by radiologists for clinical alignment

**Result:** CLEAR provides robust, multi-dimensional outputs that enhance the interpretability and clinical relevance of report evaluations, aligned with the judgment of radiologists.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed CLEAR framework enhances the evaluation of radiology reports by offering a detailed and clinically-grounded assessment approach.

**Abstract:** Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions. Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with clinical judgment.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve automated novelty assessment of academic papers, as existing methods provide limited insights by focusing on word or entity combinations only.

**Method:** Natural language processing techniques are used to identify sections (introduction, methods, results, discussion) of academic papers, and various combinations of these sections are tested as inputs for pretrained language models and large language models to predict novelty scores.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a method for automated assessment of novelty in academic papers using NLP.
	2. Identifies optimal combinations of academic sections for predicting novelty scores.
	3. Provides a dataset and code for others to explore novelty assessment using language models.

**Result:** The study finds that using the introduction, results, and discussion sections yields the best novelty score predictions, while the entire text does not produce significant results.

**Limitations:** The study relies on human expert reviewers for ground truth labels, which may introduce subjective bias.

**Conclusion:** Optimal novelty score predictions are achieved with specific section combinations, particularly the introduction and results, offering insights for automated assessment methods.

**Abstract:** Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections, e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and dataset for this paper can be accessed at https://github.com/njust-winchy/SC4ANM.

**Motivation:** To explore the limitations of embodied agents in understanding user-specific semantics and memory utilization in real-world interactions for personalized assistance.

**Method:** The MEMENTO framework consists of a two-stage memory evaluation process that quantifies the impact of memory on task performance, focusing on object semantics and user patterns.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MEMENTO framework for personalized assistance evaluation
	2. Identification of performance drop due to memory limitations in LLMs
	3. Insights on object semantics and user patterns in embodied agents

**Result:** Experiments show significant memory utilization limitations, with models like GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop in tasks involving multiple memories and user patterns.

**Limitations:** The study is a work in progress and the findings may evolve with further research.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the need for improved memory capabilities in embodied agents for better personalization, providing insights for future research.

**Abstract:** Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup, breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents' understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied agents.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the expressivity of transformers by developing a position encoding method that incorporates the actual input rather than relying solely on relative positions.

**Method:** Development of PaTH, a position encoding scheme using accumulated products of data-dependent Householder transformations, with an efficient parallel training algorithm and a FlashAttention-style implementation for reduced I/O costs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PaTH as a data-dependent position encoding scheme
	2. Development of an efficient training algorithm utilizing Householder transformations
	3. Demonstration of superior performance compared to RoPE and other baselines.

**Result:** PaTH outperforms RoPE and other recent baselines in both synthetic benchmarks and real-world language modeling experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PaTH provides a promising alternative to existing position encoding methods, potentially leading to more robust and expressive LLMs.

**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.   This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to RoPE and other recent baselines.

**Motivation:** Understanding how LLMs acquire cross-lingual abilities is essential for their interpretability and practical applications in language translation tasks.

**Method:** The authors trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers during a word translation task to identify distinct behaviors linked to co-occurrence frequency and semantic pivots. They then create a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset to improve LLMs' cross-lingual abilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task
	2. Identification of co-occurrence and semantic pivot behaviors in LLMs
	3. Development of a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset

**Result:** The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the cross-lingual ability of LLMs by utilizing a dataset enriched with semantic pivots.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on specific behaviors of LLMs and may not address all aspects of cross-lingual capabilities or generalization across all languages.

**Conclusion:** This research offers valuable insights into LLM interpretability and provides a practical approach for improving their cross-lingual translation performance.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior. We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Automatic Text Simplification, error taxonomy, Large Language Models, dataset, evaluation methods

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new framework for evaluating Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) by proposing a taxonomy of errors and a parallel dataset of simplified texts with human annotations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective evaluation methods for Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) due to the inadequacy of current metrics, especially in light of advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Method:** The authors propose a taxonomy of errors related to information distortion in simplified texts and create a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific texts, which is human-annotated based on the proposed taxonomy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new error taxonomy for ATS evaluation.
	2. Development of a human-annotated dataset of automatically simplified scientific texts.
	3. Analysis of current models' performance in detecting errors based on the proposed taxonomy.

**Result:** The study evaluates the quality of the dataset and assesses the performance of existing models in detecting and classifying errors according to the taxonomy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework and dataset provide valuable resources for researchers to enhance the evaluation of ATS and improve the quality of simplified texts.

**Abstract:** The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation. Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors, underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion. Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality of automatically simplified texts.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** feature attribution, speech processing, model interpretation

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the reliability of feature attribution methods in speech processing, finding that standard approaches are generally unreliable except for word-aligned perturbation methods in word-based classification tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the evolution of large-scale pre-trained models, understanding the inputs that influence model outputs is critical, especially in the context of speech processing.

**Method:** The study examines how input type, aggregation, and perturbation timespan affect the effectiveness of feature attribution methods in the speech domain.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of input types and their effects on feature attribution reliability
	2. Identification of specific scenarios where standard methods fail
	3. Highlighting word-aligned perturbation methods as reliable for specific tasks

**Result:** It was found that standard feature attribution methods are often unreliable for speech tasks, with word-aligned perturbation methods being an exception for word-based classifications.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on word-based classification tasks, which may not generalize to other speech-related tasks.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the importance of choosing appropriate feature attribution methods for speech-related tasks, given the unique characteristics of the input signals.

**Abstract:** As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Cultural Values, Large Language Models, World Values Survey, Cultural Adaptation, Encyclopedic Narratives

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the adaptation of cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) using World Values Survey data and proposes augmenting it with additional cultural narratives to improve performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There are significant challenges in adapting cultural values in LLMs, mainly due to biases and the limitations of training data, particularly concerning the World Values Survey.

**Method:** The study systematically investigates WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and augments it with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic investigation of WVS-based training for cultural adaptation in LLMs
	2. Introduction of encyclopedic and scenario-based narratives to enhance cultural representations
	3. Empirical analysis of the impact of narrative augmentation on task performance

**Result:** The findings indicate that using survey data alone can lead to homogenized cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge, while the additional narratives improve cultural distinctiveness in downstream tasks.

**Limitations:** Variable effects of cultural narratives on different downstream tasks.

**Conclusion:** The work underscores the complexity of aligning cultural values in LLMs to better guide task-specific behavior.

**Abstract:** Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey (WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding task-specific behavior.

**TL;DR:** Tool-Star is an RL-based framework enabling LLMs to autonomously use multiple external tools for collaborative reasoning, enhancing their performance on complex reasoning tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing reasoning capabilities of LLMs highlight the need for effective multi-tool collaboration in complex problem-solving scenarios.

**Method:** Tool-Star utilizes a two-stage training framework: it fine-tunes LLMs via tool-invocation feedback and employs a self-critic RL algorithm to improve collaborative reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Tool-Star framework for multi-tool reasoning in LLMs.
	2. Development of a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline.
	3. Implementation of a two-stage training approach to enhance tool collaboration.

**Result:** Experimental results on over 10 reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Tool-Star significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs in multi-tool collaborative reasoning.

**Limitations:** The framework is still a work in progress and initial analyses may not cover all possible reasoning scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Tool-Star presents a systematic approach for LLMs to improve their reasoning ability through better tool integration and training methodologies.

**Abstract:** Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available at https://github.com/dongguanting/Tool-Star.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the potential of ARC-JSD to enhance RAG systems while providing insights into the mechanisms of context attribution.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

**Conclusion:** Enhancing diversity in ad text generation is essential to mitigate ad fatigue and improve overall advertisement effectiveness.

**Abstract:** In natural language generation for advertising, creating diverse and engaging ad texts is crucial for capturing a broad audience and avoiding advertising fatigue. Regardless of the importance of diversity, the impact of the diversity-enhancing methods in ad text generation -- mainly tested on tasks such as summarization and machine translation -- has not been thoroughly explored. Ad text generation significantly differs from these tasks owing to the text style and requirements. This research explores the relationship between diversity and ad quality in ad text generation by considering multiple factors, such as diversity-enhancing methods, their hyperparameters, input-output formats, and the models.

**TL;DR:** WebAgent-R1 is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework for training web agents, enhancing task success rates in dynamic web interfaces.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions in dynamic web interfaces using reinforcement learning, which has been primarily focused on single-turn tasks.

**Method:** WebAgent-R1 uses an end-to-end framework that learns from online interactions by generating diverse trajectories and is guided by binary rewards based on task success.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the WebAgent-R1 framework for multi-turn web agent training.
	2. Demonstrated substantial improvements in task success rates over existing models.
	3. Exploration of RL initialization policies enhances understanding of behavior cloning and CoT reasoning.

**Result:** WebAgent-R1 improves the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, outperforming existing methods and proprietary models like OpenAI o3.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that the WebAgent-R1 framework is a significant advancement in training multi-turn RL web agents, demonstrating the potential of thinking-based prompting and the effectiveness of different RL initialization policies.

**Abstract:** While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a framework for converting procedural text into visual instructions, addressing challenges in effectively communicating complex actions and spatial relationships in NLP.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The effective communication of procedural knowledge in NLP is challenging due to limitations in conveying complex physical actions with text alone.

**Method:** The framework translates procedural text into visual instructions by analyzing the linguistic structure and decomposing it into goal statements and sequential steps, using a constituency parser-based encoding and a discourse coherence model.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** Experiments on three datasets (HTStep, CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) show significant improvements over existing methods in visually representing linguistic instructions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper contributes to research on grounding procedural language in visual content, with potential applications in education, task guidance, and multimodal language understanding.

**Abstract:** The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep, CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and multimodal language understanding.

**Motivation:** Traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive and offline methods are inadequate for dynamic interactions in recommender systems; thus, a new simulation platform is needed.

**Method:** RecInter utilizes agent-based simulation with a dynamic interaction mechanism where simulated user actions update item attributes in real-time and involve Merchant Agents for realistic ecosystem responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RecInter, a dynamic agent-based simulation platform.
	2. Real-time updates of item attributes based on user interactions.
	3. Ability to replicate emergent phenomena in recommender system behavior.

**Result:** The platform improves the credibility of simulations, replicating phenomena such as Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect through realistic evolution of the system.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RecInter serves as a credible testbed for research in recommender systems, significantly enhancing simulation fidelity and user interaction dynamics.

**Abstract:** Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores how Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user demographic information from conversation cues, highlighting issues of stereotype-driven implicit personalization and proposing methods for mitigation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the effects of implicit personalization by LLMs, especially concerning minority groups and the accuracy of their responses based on demographic inferences.

**Method:** The authors conducted a systematic exploration using controlled synthetic conversations and analyzed LLMs' latent user representations through model internals and responses to specific user questions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified how LLMs infer demographic information from conversation cues.
	2. Demonstrated the persistence of stereotype-driven biases regardless of user self-identification.
	3. Proposed a mitigation strategy using trained linear probes on models' internal representations.

**Result:** LLMs were found to infer demographic attributes based on stereotypical cues, leading to biased responses even against users identifying with a different demographic group. The study also showed that these biases can be mitigated by intervening with a trained linear probe on the model's internal representations.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on synthetic conversations, which may not fully capture the complexities of real interactions.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the necessity for improved transparency and control over how LLMs handle user identity representations, particularly in relation to stereotype-driven biases.

**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop reliable information-seeking systems, it is essential to enhance the faithfulness of LLMs in their output, which is traditionally reliant on human annotations.

**Method:** The CANOE framework generates high-quality, verifiable training data by synthesizing short-form QA data from diverse tasks and employs a rule-based reinforcement learning method (Dual-GRPO) to optimize response generation without manual labeling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Synthesis of high-quality training data without human annotations.
	2. Introduction of Dual-GRPO for optimizing response generation.
	3. Demonstration of improved LLM faithfulness across numerous tasks.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that CANOE significantly enhances the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework provides a robust solution for improving the generation quality of LLMs while bypassing the limitations of manual annotation, potentially expanding the applicability of LLMs in various domains.

**Abstract:** Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how Large Language Models capture sentiment information, which remains poorly understood despite their popularity in NLP tasks.

**Method:** Probe classifiers were used to analyze sentiment encoding across different layers of Llama models, identifying which layers and pooling methods best capture sentiment signals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of optimal layers and pooling methods for sentiment detection in Llama models
	2. Demonstration of improved sentiment analysis accuracy using layer-specific probing
	3. Reduction of memory requirements for sentiment tasks by an average of 57%

**Result:** The research found that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with up to 14% accuracy increase over prompting techniques and a 57% reduction in memory requirements for sentiment tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Layer-specific probing enhances our understanding of sentiment in LLMs and suggests effective methods for improving sentiment task performance and model utility.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP, demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis.   Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.   These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the AppealCase dataset to advance LegalAI by focusing on the appellate process, presenting five novel tasks, and evaluating mainstream models on judgment reversal predictions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the oversight of appellate processes in LegalAI research, emphasizing the significance of appeals in error correction and fair trials.

**Method:** Development of the AppealCase dataset comprising 10,000 matched documents across civil case categories, with detailed annotations and evaluation across 20 models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the AppealCase dataset with real-world matched documents
	2. Presentation of five novel LegalAI tasks
	3. Comprehensive evaluation of existing models' performances on the dataset

**Result:** All mainstream models achieved less than 50% F1 scores on judgment reversal predictions, indicating challenges in the appeal analysis.

**Limitations:** The complexity and challenge of judgment reversal prediction indicate currently inadequate model performance, which may limit immediate practical applications.

**Conclusion:** The dataset aims to foster further research in appellate case analysis within LegalAI to enhance judicial decision-making consistency.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research. To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000 pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in judicial decision-making.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Context Utilisation Benchmark (CUB) for evaluating context utilisation manipulation techniques (CMTs) in retrieval-augmented generation tasks, revealing deficiencies in existing methods when handling real-world context scenarios.

**Read time:** 27 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to incorporate external knowledge effectively in knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering and fact checking, while addressing the limitations of language models that may ignore relevant information or be distracted by irrelevant contexts.

**Method:** The authors developed CUB to systematically evaluate and compare seven state-of-the-art CMTs across three diverse datasets and tasks, applying the techniques to nine different language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Context Utilisation Benchmark (CUB)
	2. Systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art CMTs
	3. Identification of performance discrepancies across datasets

**Result:** The evaluation revealed that existing CMTs often failed to manage various types of contexts encountered in real-world scenarios and demonstrated inflated performances on simplified datasets compared to realistic ones.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** There is a clear need for more comprehensive evaluations of CMTs and the creation of techniques capable of accommodating multiple types of contexts in retrieval-augmented tasks.

**Abstract:** Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs) may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets, compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples. Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Factual hallucinations in LLMs undermine their reliability and user trust, necessitating better evaluation methods for accuracy.

**Method:** The paper proposes a strategy for sampling true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and generating realistic true-false datasets from Question Answering collections.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a plausible true-false sentence sampling strategy from tabular data
	2. Creation of realistic LLM-dependent true-false datasets
	3. Validation and challenges of previous findings regarding truthfulness encoding in LLMs

**Result:** Analysis of two open-source LLMs indicates that while some previous findings are validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets is still difficult.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study establishes a foundation for future research on LLM factuality and provides guidelines for effective evaluation.

**Abstract:** Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more effective evaluation.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a multi-bias benchmark for large language models (LLMs) that addresses the issue of multiple biases in data and proposes a causal effect estimation-guided method for bias elimination to improve LLM generalizability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the poor generalizability of LLMs caused by biases during inference in practical applications.

**Method:** The authors propose a multi-bias benchmark containing five types of biases and introduce a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE) to estimate and eliminate these biases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a multi-bias benchmark for LLMs.
	2. Development of CMBE for simultaneous bias elimination.
	3. Demonstration of CMBE's effectiveness in improving LLM generalizability.

**Result:** Evaluations reveal inadequate performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods, while CMBE effectively eliminates multiple biases simultaneously, enhancing LLM generalizability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed CMBE method shows promise in addressing the challenges associated with multiple biases in LLMs, which is crucial for improving their application in diverse scenarios.

**Abstract:** Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying, highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously. Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference. Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the difficulty sLLMs have in maintaining topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is essential for applications like service chatbots to avoid off-topic or malicious inputs.

**Method:** EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty to effectively handle off-topic distractors while maintaining on-topic accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of EnSToM for topic maintenance in sLLMs
	2. Demonstrated performance improvement with minimal data
	3. Preservation of on-topic accuracy in the presence of distractors

**Result:** Experiments show that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with a smaller data size compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.

**Limitations:** Preliminary experiments reveal limitations of existing activation engineering methods in ensuring topic adherence.

**Conclusion:** EnSToM offers a robust solution for improving topic adherence in sLLM-based dialogue systems without sacrificing efficiency.

**Abstract:** Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments. However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots. Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence. Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

**Read time:** 16 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Language confusion in large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges, especially for English-centric models.

**Method:** The study employs behavioral benchmarking and neuron-level analysis using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB) to identify confusion points and analyze neuron functionality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First mechanistic interpretability study of language confusion in LLMs.
	2. Introduction of the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB).
	3. Demonstration of effective neuron-level interventions to reduce language confusion.

**Result:** The analysis reveals that transition failures in LLMs' final layers are key to language confusion and highlights the potential for editing critical neurons to alleviate this issue effectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that neuron-level interventions can improve multilingual capabilities without sacrificing overall language fluency, offering a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance.

**Abstract:** Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability (MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur -- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust, interpretable multilingual language modeling.

**TL;DR:** A novel framework called Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR) that enhances reasoning efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via dynamic compression of reasoning processes.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the computational expense and inefficiency of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models.

**Method:** CoLaR employs a two-stage training approach that involves supervised fine-tuning with an auxiliary compression objective, followed by reinforcement learning to explore diverse and compact reasoning paths.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR) framework.
	2. Dynamic adjustment of reasoning speed based on compression factors during inference.
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements with reduced reasoning length across multiple datasets.

**Result:** CoLaR improves accuracy by 14.1% over baseline methods while significantly reducing reasoning chain length by 53.3% and achieving performance gains on challenging tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed CoLaR framework offers a more efficient and effective means of reasoning in LLMs, promising reductions in reasoning length and improvements in task performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks fail to evaluate LLMs' knowledge in scalable and complex academic contexts, necessitating a new comprehensive evaluation framework.

**Method:** The benchmark was constructed through a three-step process, defining category-specific attributes and designing aligned questions across eight research domains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating academic reasoning in LLMs.
	2. Focus on deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving.
	3. Bilingual dataset supporting evaluations in both English and Korean.

**Result:** The benchmark includes 5,031 examples in Korean and 5,309 in English, revealing that even advanced LLMs struggle, with an average score of only 0.543.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may still not capture all facets of academic reasoning and may require ongoing updates to keep pace with evolving knowledge.

**Conclusion:** ScholarBench effectively challenges LLMs in their reasoning and linguistic capabilities, showcasing the need for rigorous evaluation in specialized contexts.

**Abstract:** Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks. To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and 5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of this benchmark.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of contextual metadata in training Large Language Models (LLMs) and finds that only URL context enhances training efficiency and downstream performance, while other metadata types do not.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the training efficiency and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating the effectiveness of different types of contextual metadata.

**Method:** A systematic evaluation of various metadata types, including URL information, quality scores, and topic/domain descriptions, to analyze their impact on training and downstream performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of URL context as the only metadata type that accelerates training.
	2. Demonstration of improved controllability in generation with context-aware pretraining.
	3. Clarification on the limited benefits of quality scores and topic metadata in training efficiency.

**Result:** URL context significantly speeds up training and improves performance when used with longer prompts; other metadata types provide no clear benefits, but are useful for output control.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on URL context and may not generalize to other types of metadata not tested.

**Conclusion:** Context-aware pretraining allows for better control over generated outputs, highlighting the importance of URL metadata while suggesting that other types, though not beneficial for training speed, can steer outputs effectively.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic, leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally. Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering human-interpretable control over generation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the fidelity of fact-checking systems by emulating human behaviors in claim verification more closely.

**Method:** The proposed system uses a multi-agent framework where different agents perform distinct tasks such as ranking search results and evaluating content based on predefined criteria.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the EMULATE system for claim verification.
	2. Utilization of a multi-agent framework to distribute tasks.
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements on benchmark datasets.

**Result:** The EMULATE system showed significant improvements in performance over previous methods in extensive benchmark experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** EMULATE effectively enhances the claim verification process by mimicking human-like iterative evidence retrieval methods.

**Abstract:** Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling open-ended questions, which often require dynamic and up-to-date information, and to improve performance beyond static parametric knowledge.

**Method:** O$^2$-Searcher uses a reinforcement learning framework to create a locally simulated search environment that allows for dynamic knowledge acquisition. It incorporates a unified training mechanism with tailored reward functions to adapt strategies based on problem type.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of O$^2$-Searcher as a novel search agent for diverse question types.
	2. Development of O$^2$-QA benchmark with 300 curated open-ended questions.
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements over existing models using a 3B parameter model.

**Result:** O$^2$-Searcher significantly outperforms leading LLM agents on the O$^2$-QA benchmark, which contains 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions, and also achieves state-of-the-art results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that O$^2$-Searcher effectively bridges the gap in LLM capabilities for open-ended questions while maintaining competitive performance on closed-ended tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.

**Motivation:** The paper aims to evaluate the factual abilities of LLMs in a multilingual context, addressing gaps in existing assessments.

**Method:** The authors developed a question set covering 9 languages, focusing on single knowledge points, objectivity, and temporal stability, allowing evaluation of both traditional LLMs and new Large Reasoning Models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a multilingual factual benchmark for LLMs
	2. Inclusion of both global and language-specific domains
	3. Highlighting performance differences in LLMs across diverse contexts

**Result:** Evaluation of several mainstream LLMs revealed notable differences in performance across general and language-specific domains, necessitating targeted optimization for multilingual applications.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** KoLasSimpleQA provides insights into the limits of LLM capabilities in multilingual settings, aiming to inform future model enhancements.

**Abstract:** We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research, we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know"). KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth (Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics, ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** media framing, stance detection, climate change, internet memes, dataset

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the interaction between stance and media framing in climate change memes, presenting the CLIMATEMEMES dataset and evaluating stance and media frame detection tasks using LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo models.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how media framing and stance interact, particularly in the context of climate change, using internet memes as a case study.

**Method:** The authors curated the CLIMATEMEMES dataset, which contains 1,184 annotated climate change memes. They conducted stance detection and media frame detection tasks using various models, including LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo, and analyzed their performances.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CLIMATEMEMES dataset
	2. Exploration of the interaction between stance and media framing
	3. Evaluation of model performance in meme understanding tasks

**Result:** The study found that while Visual Language Models (VLMs) perform well on stance detection, they struggle with media frame detection compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), which outperform them in that task.

**Limitations:** VLMs have limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions in climate change memes.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of further exploring the nuances of media frames and stances in the context of internet memes, with implications for understanding public perceptions of climate change.

**Abstract:** Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47 subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities, and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs' limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change internet memes.

### [106] [From Generic Empathy to Personalized Emotional Support: A Self-Evolution Framework for User Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16610)

*Jing Ye, Lu Xiang, Yaping Zhang, Chengqing Zong*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Emotion, Large Language Models, Personalized Responses, Emotional Support, Self-Improvement

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** A framework for improving LLMs' emotional support responses by aligning with user preferences through self-reflection and refinement.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the emotional support provided by LLMs by making responses more personalized and reflective of users' implicit preferences.

**Method:** The framework involves two phases: 1) fine-tuning LLMs on emotional support data to acquire basic support, and 2) self-refinement to optimize responses based on user preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a self-evolution framework to improve LLM responses to emotional support.
	2. Employs iterative preference optimization for personalized responses.
	3. Validates the framework through extensive experiments demonstrating performance improvements.

**Result:** The proposed method significantly improves the performance of LLMs in delivering emotional support, reducing generic responses and aligning better with user needs through iterative preference optimizations.

**Limitations:** The framework is dependent on the quality of the initial emotional support conversation data used for fine-tuning.

**Conclusion:** The self-evolution framework effectively helps LLMs to better understand and cater to the emotional states and preferences of users, enhancing the quality of emotional support.

**Abstract:** Effective emotional support hinges on understanding users' emotions and needs to provide meaningful comfort during multi-turn interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential for expressing empathy; however, they often deliver generic and one-size-fits-all responses that fail to address users' specific needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-evolution framework designed to help LLMs improve their responses to better align with users' implicit preferences concerning user profiles (personalities), emotional states, and specific situations. Our framework consists of two distinct phases: \textit{(1)} \textit{Emotional Support Experience Acquisition}, where LLMs are fine-tuned on limited emotional support conversation data to provide basic support, and \textit{(2)} \textit{Self-Improvement for Personalized Emotional Support}, where LLMs leverage self-reflection and self-refinement to generate personalized responses. Through iterative direct preference optimization between the pre- and post-refined responses, our model generates responses that reflect a better understanding of the user's implicit preferences. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the model's performance in emotional support, reducing unhelpful responses and minimizing discrepancies between user preferences and model outputs.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores personalized machine translation using LLMs with a focus on literary translations, proposing strategies for effective personalization while maintaining quality.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for personalized translations that meet specific stylistic constraints in low-resource settings, particularly in literary translation, where traditional prompting fails to capture nuanced stylistic requirements.

**Method:** The paper investigates various prompting strategies and inference-time interventions in LLMs, introducing a contrastive framework that leverages latent concepts from sparse autoencoders to identify important personalization attributes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for LLM personalization
	2. Development of a contrastive framework using sparse autoencoders for personalization attributes
	3. Demonstration of the relationship between prompting and personalization influence on LLM representations

**Result:** Steering methods lead to significant personalization in translations while maintaining quality, with insights into the effects on LLM representations and the interaction of multi-shot prompting and steering.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Personalization in LLM-generated translations is achievable even in challenging domains, with effective methods that do not compromise the quality of translations.

**Abstract:** High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models (LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a Simple Self-Rewarding Reinforcement Learning framework for machine translation that eliminates reliance on costly external supervision.


**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of relying on external supervision signals during training of machine translation models, which are expensive and difficult to scale.

**Method:** The authors propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) RL framework that is reference-free and operates fully online, using self-judging rewards from 13K monolingual examples with the Qwen-2.5-7B model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the Simple Self-Rewarding RL framework for MT.
	2. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance in translation tasks without external references.
	3. Public release of code, data, and models to support further research.

**Result:** The SSR-Zero-7B model outperforms several advanced MT models, including TowerInstruct-13B and larger general LLMs, in English ⇄ Chinese translation tasks. An augmented model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, using external supervision, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the self-rewarding mechanism is more effective than traditional external judging methods in machine translation and complements trained reward models, indicating a promising direction for RL methods in MT.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

**Conclusion:** The synergy from multiple LLMs leads to improved reasoning and prediction accuracy, suggesting potential for effective applications in healthcare.

**Abstract:** Empowered by vast internal knowledge reservoir, the new generation of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate untapped potential to tackle medical tasks. However, there is insufficient effort made towards summoning up a synergic effect from multiple LLMs' expertise and background. In this study, we propose a multi-LLM collaboration framework tailored on a medical multiple-choice questions dataset. Through post-hoc analysis on 3 pre-trained LLM participants, our framework is proved to boost all LLMs reasoning ability as well as alleviate their divergence among questions. We also measure an LLM's confidence when it confronts with adversary opinions from other LLMs and observe a concurrence between LLM's confidence and prediction accuracy.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** classical Chinese, mathematics, reasoning models, machine learning, cross-linguistic

**Relevance Score:** 2

**TL;DR:** This study presents Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning models on ancient Chinese mathematical texts, revealing their limitations and suggesting the need for improved cultural comprehension.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to address the challenges of processing classical Chinese mathematical texts and evaluating reasoning models under unique linguistic constraints.

**Method:** The research built Guji_MATH, extracting 538 mathematical problems from 8 ancient texts, using machine-assisted annotation and manual verification to create a structured dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Guji_MATH benchmark for ancient mathematical texts
	2. Structured dataset of 538 problems using the Question-Answer-Solution framework
	3. Evaluation of reasoning models' performance on cross-linguistic and cross-cultural tasks

**Result:** Reasoning models demonstrated partial understanding of ancient Chinese mathematical problems, but their overall performance was inferior to established benchmarks for modern tasks.

**Limitations:** The models' comprehensiveness and performance on classical texts remain lower compared to modern problems; cultural and linguistic optimization is required.

**Conclusion:** There is a significant need to enhance reasoning models' comprehension of classical Chinese and cultural knowledge to optimize their performance on ancient problems.

**Abstract:** This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models' classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the need for improved NLP tools in the pharmaceutical field and evaluate their performance rigorously.

**Method:** Continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens; introduction of new benchmarks for evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a domain-specific model for pharmaceuticals
	2. Introduction of novel evaluation benchmarks (YakugakuQA, NayoseQA, SogoCheck)
	3. Demonstration of competitive performance against existing models including commercial options.

**Result:** The model outperforms existing open models and is competitive with commercial models, particularly on specialized tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates the potential for creating practical language models for domain-specific applications and provides essential evaluation resources.

**Abstract:** We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o. Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP. Our model, codes, and datasets are released at https://github.com/EQUES-Inc/pharma-LLM-eval.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores how transformer-based language models develop the ability for In-Context Meta Learning during training, identifying distinct phases and circuits involved in acquiring this capability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how transformer-based language models can meta-learn tasks from context rather than merely copying answers, which is crucial for practical In-Context Learning (ICL).

**Method:** The authors experimentally analyze the model's circuit dynamics during training in a novel In-Context Meta Learning setup, extending previous copy task methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel In-Context Meta Learning framework to analyze transformer training dynamics.
	2. Identified multiple learning phases with unique circuit formations in language models.
	3. Provided insights linking circuit emergence to known phenomena in large language models.

**Result:** The study identifies multiple phases in the acquisition of meta-learning abilities, each associated with the emergence of distinct circuits, shedding light on the transformers' ICL capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Insights gained from the dynamics of circuit emergence provide a deeper understanding of how transformers develop their ICL abilities, suggesting a complex learning process beyond simple induction head changes.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context; how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries. Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source of the transformer's ICL ability.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Locate-then-Merge, a framework for multimodal large language models that prevents catastrophic forgetting of language skills during multimodal instruction tuning by selectively merging important parameters.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in multimodal large language models, particularly in relation to retaining language abilities while acquiring new visual capabilities.

**Method:** The authors propose a training-free parameter fusion framework called Locate-then-Merge, which identifies important parameters and merges them judiciously. Additionally, a neuron-level approach called Neuron-Fusion is introduced to focus on neurons with significant parameter shifts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Locate-then-Merge framework for parameter fusion in MLLMs
	2. Development of Neuron-Fusion strategy for neuron-level parameter management
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness in reducing context hallucination in generated outputs.

**Result:** Neuron-Fusion outperforms existing model merging methods in 13 benchmarks across language and visual tasks, effectively reducing context hallucination in generated outputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method successfully balances the retention of language skills while adapting to new visual capabilities, thus enhancing the performance of multimodal large language models without requiring additional training.

**Abstract:** Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation. Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in generation.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** TRIM is a novel pruning method for large language models that applies varying sparsity to output dimensions to optimize performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in model compression.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large Language Models require pruning for efficient deployment due to their size, and existing methods can hinder performance at high sparsity.

**Method:** TRIM applies targeted row-wise pruning with varying sparsity ratios across individual output dimensions and utilizes an iterative adjustment process based on quality metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TRIM for dimension-wise sparsity allocation
	2. Demonstrated performance improvements on multiple LLMs
	3. Integration capability with existing pruning strategies

**Result:** TRIM achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly reducing perplexity at high sparsity levels, and enhancing stability across various LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for optimal LLM compression performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at: https://github.com/flobk/TRIM

**Motivation:** To address the gap in evaluating instruction-following capabilities of audio LLMs, which have been underexplored compared to text and vision-language models.

**Method:** The authors created IFEval-Audio, consisting of 280 audio-instruction-answer triples, assessing various dimensions related to instruction-following in audio LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of IFEval-Audio dataset for audiobased instruction-following assessment
	2. Benchmarking of existing audio LLMs

**Result:** Benchmarking on state-of-the-art audio LLMs demonstrated varying levels of ability to follow complex audio instructions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The IFEval-Audio dataset aims to enable future research on instruction-following in audio models and improve their performance.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280 audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content, Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

**Method:** A comprehensive review and analysis of latent CoT reasoning, categorized into token-wise strategies, internal mechanisms, and applications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a unified taxonomy for latent CoT reasoning in LLMs.

**Result:** The paper presents a proposed taxonomy of latent reasoning methods and highlights their strengths and challenges.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A structured foundation is provided to advance the study of latent reasoning in LLMs, with plans for ongoing updates to relevant literature.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, conventional CoT relies on reasoning steps explicitly verbalized in natural language, introducing inefficiencies and limiting its applicability to abstract reasoning. To address this, there has been growing research interest in latent CoT reasoning, where inference occurs within latent spaces. By decoupling reasoning from language, latent reasoning promises richer cognitive representations and more flexible, faster inference. Researchers have explored various directions in this promising field, including training methodologies, structural innovations, and internal reasoning mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of this reasoning paradigm. We begin by proposing a unified taxonomy from four perspectives: token-wise strategies, internal mechanisms, analysis, and applications. We then provide in-depth discussions and comparative analyses of representative methods, highlighting their design patterns, strengths, and open challenges. We aim to provide a structured foundation for advancing this emerging direction in LLM reasoning. The relevant papers will be regularly updated at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/Awesome-Latent-CoT.

While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity within our experimental datasets.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models struggle with knowledge-intensive multi-step reasoning tasks due to ineffective evidence extraction and uncertainty in rationale evidence.

**Method:** The proposed approach includes a two-way evidence self-alignment (TW-ESA) module for enhancing causal logic understanding and a dual-gated reasoning enhancement (DGR) module for fusing LLM knowledge with strict reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a two-way evidence self-alignment (TW-ESA) module.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integrated ESA-DGR framework significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on complex tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling uncertainty and improving logical accuracy.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in knowledge-intensive multi-step reasoning (KIMSR) tasks. One challenge is how to effectively extract and represent rationale evidence. The current methods often extract semantically relevant but logically irrelevant evidence, resulting in flawed reasoning and inaccurate responses. We propose a two-way evidence self-alignment (TW-ESA) module, which utilizes the mutual alignment between strict reasoning and LLM reasoning to enhance its understanding of the causal logic of evidence, thereby addressing the first challenge. Another challenge is how to utilize the rationale evidence and LLM's intrinsic knowledge for accurate reasoning when the evidence contains uncertainty. We propose a dual-gated reasoning enhancement (DGR) module to gradually fuse useful knowledge of LLM within strict reasoning, which can enable the model to perform accurate reasoning by focusing on causal elements in the evidence and exhibit greater robustness. The two modules are collaboratively trained in a unified framework ESA-DGR. Extensive experiments on three diverse and challenging KIMSR datasets reveal that ESA-DGR significantly surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-based fine-tuning methods, with remarkable average improvements of 4% in exact match (EM) and 5% in F1 score. The implementation code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESA-DGR-2BF8.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** unlearning, large language models, representation-level evaluation, irreversible forgetting, model behavior

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper critiques current evaluation methods for unlearning in large language models, revealing that misleading performance metrics can obscure true model behavior, and proposes a novel representation-level evaluation framework.

**Read time:** 44 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the shortcomings of current evaluation metrics for unlearning in large language models, which may not adequately reflect the actual effects of unlearning processes.

**Method:** The authors introduce a representation-level evaluation framework utilizing PCA-based similarity, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information to assess unlearning methods across different domains and models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new representation-level evaluation framework for LLM unlearning
	2. Identification of the distinction between reversible and irreversible forgetting
	3. Provision of a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing representation changes in LLMs during unlearning

**Result:** The study identifies a critical distinction between reversible and irreversible unlearning, showing that while reversible unlearning leads to token-level collapse, latent features may remain intact; irreversible forgetting results in deeper representational damage.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on specific domains and models, which may not generalize to all LLMs or tasks.

**Conclusion:** Current evaluation practices are fundamentally flawed, obscuring true model behavior after unlearning; a new diagnostic framework is established for trustworthy unlearning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information. Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code, math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes under unlearning and relearning: https://github.com/XiaoyuXU1/Representational_Analysis_Tools.git.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models while overcoming computational overhead and local reasoning signal loss associated with existing compression methods.

**Method:** R1-Compress segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks and applies LLM-driven inner-chunk compression alongside an inter-chunk search mechanism for coherent output.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a two-stage chunk-level compression framework for Long-CoT reasoning.
	2. Preservation of local reasoning signals and coherence during compression.
	3. Demonstrated significant reduction in token usage with maintained accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

**Result:** R1-Compress significantly reduces token usage by about 20% while maintaining reasoning accuracy, achieving 92.4% accuracy on MATH500 with only a 0.6% drop compared to the Long-CoT baseline.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** R1-Compress effectively balances the trade-off between compression and reasoning accuracy, making it a promising approach for improving LLM efficiency.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by enabling step-by-step problem-solving, yet its extension to Long-CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to increased token length. Existing compression approaches -- instance-level and token-level -- either sacrifice essential local reasoning signals like reflection or yield incoherent outputs. To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short and coherent sequence. Experiments on Qwen2.5-Instruct models across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that R1-Compress significantly reduces token usage while maintaining comparable reasoning accuracy. On MATH500, R1-Compress achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, with only a 0.6% drop compared to the Long-CoT baseline, while reducing token usage by about 20%.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper reviews various subword tokenization methods and their impact on machine translation for Indian languages, highlighting the advantages of SentencePiece and BPE based on empirical results.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address challenges in machine translation for Indian languages by employing effective subword tokenization techniques that account for their complex morphological structures.

**Method:** The paper compares the performance of SentencePiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and WordPiece tokenization across statistical and neural machine translation models using standard metrics like BLEU, TER, METEOR, and others.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive analysis of tokenization strategies for Indian languages.
	2. Empirical evaluation of performance across multiple machine translation models.
	3. Identification of optimal tokenization methods for different translation contexts.

**Result:** SentencePiece consistently outperformed other tokenization methods in statistical and neural MT models, while BPE was most effective in multilingual neural MT scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study indicates that, regardless of tokenizer used, translations from Indian languages to English were more successful than vice versa, suggesting a need for tailored approaches in machine translation.

**Abstract:** Tokenization is the act of breaking down text into smaller parts, or tokens, that are easier for machines to process. This is a key phase in machine translation (MT) models. Subword tokenization enhances this process by breaking down words into smaller subword units, which is especially beneficial in languages with complicated morphology or a vast vocabulary. It is useful in capturing the intricate structure of words in Indian languages (ILs), such as prefixes, suffixes, and other morphological variations. These languages frequently use agglutinative structures, in which words are formed by the combination of multiple morphemes such as suffixes, prefixes, and stems. As a result, a suitable tokenization strategy must be chosen to address these scenarios. This paper examines how different subword tokenization techniques, such as SentencePiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and WordPiece Tokenization, affect ILs. The effectiveness of these subword tokenization techniques is investigated in statistical, neural, and multilingual neural machine translation models. All models are examined using standard evaluation metrics, such as the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, TER, METEOR, CHRF, RIBES, and COMET. Based on the results, it appears that for the majority of language pairs for the Statistical and Neural MT models, the SentencePiece tokenizer continuously performed better than other tokenizers in terms of BLEU score. However, BPE tokenization outperformed other tokenization techniques in the context of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model. The results show that, despite using the same tokenizer and dataset for each model, translations from ILs to English surpassed translations from English to ILs.

**Conclusion:** MPO provides a solution for enhancing multilingual safety alignment in LLMs, maintaining their overall utility while improving safety across languages.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to AI applications worldwide, necessitating robust multilingual safety alignment to ensure secure deployment across diverse linguistic contexts. Existing preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the dominant language (English) to improve safety alignment across multiple languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language. Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate MPO's efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general multilingual utility.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Efficient management of compute resources for LLM inference is difficult due to variability in response lengths during text generation.

**Method:** The dataset CASTILLO was created by generating 10 completions for various prompt and model pairs and analyzing the response length distributions statistically.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the CASTILLO dataset for response length analysis.
	2. Insight into inter- and intra-model variability during text generation.
	3. Release of tools for continued research in generative language modeling.

**Result:** The analysis shows significant variability in response lengths both between and within models, revealing model-specific behaviors.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CASTILLO facilitates the development of predictive models for resource scheduling and aids in the understanding of model-specific generation behaviors.

**Abstract:** Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM) inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13 widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10 independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev, percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling and systems.

**TL;DR:** This study systematically investigates the relationship between hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) and internal state changes caused by the injection of incremental context.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding hallucinations in LLMs is critical for reliable applications, especially in health informatics and other AI-related fields.

**Method:** The authors constructed two titration tracks for each question using TruthfulQA, measuring hallucination rates and monitoring internal states and attention maps across six open-source LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First systematic study linking hallucination to internal-state drift
	2. Identification of key correlation between context injection and hallucination solidification
	3. Empirical basis for intrinsic hallucination prediction methods

**Result:** The study found that hallucination frequency increases with incremental context up to a threshold, where self-consistent hallucinations occur with high confidence; also, attention-locking thresholds mark a point beyond which hallucinations are more resistant to correction.

**Limitations:** Focus on specific LLM models might limit generalizability to all models.

**Conclusion:** These insights provide a foundation for better prediction and mitigation of hallucinations in LLMs, with implications for their reliable deployment in applications.

**Abstract:** Hallucinations -- plausible yet erroneous outputs -- remain a critical barrier to reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). We present the first systematic study linking hallucination incidence to internal-state drift induced by incremental context injection. Using TruthfulQA, we construct two 16-round "titration" tracks per question: one appends relevant but partially flawed snippets, the other injects deliberately misleading content. Across six open-source LLMs, we track overt hallucination rates with a tri-perspective detector and covert dynamics via cosine, entropy, JS and Spearman drifts of hidden states and attention maps. Results reveal (1) monotonic growth of hallucination frequency and representation drift that plateaus after 5--7 rounds; (2) relevant context drives deeper semantic assimilation, producing high-confidence "self-consistent" hallucinations, whereas irrelevant context induces topic-drift errors anchored by attention re-routing; and (3) convergence of JS-Drift ($\sim0.69$) and Spearman-Drift ($\sim0$) marks an "attention-locking" threshold beyond which hallucinations solidify and become resistant to correction. Correlation analyses expose a seesaw between assimilation capacity and attention diffusion, clarifying size-dependent error modes. These findings supply empirical foundations for intrinsic hallucination prediction and context-aware mitigation mechanisms.

**Result:** PDL improves the quality, diversity, and informativeness of generated text by ensuring models focus on more specific tokens that convey unique information.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper demonstrates that PDL is beneficial for various text generation tasks, shedding light on ways to enhance model performance in generating rich and informative content.

**Abstract:** During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus, following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information, thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, uncertainty expression, benchmark, long-form QA, short-form QA

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Introducing UNCLE, a novel benchmark for evaluating uncertainty expression in LLMs during long- and short-form question answering, revealing current limitations and suggesting methods for improvement.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the growing use of LLMs, the issue of hallucination, especially in long-form generation, remains largely unaddressed. This paper aims to evaluate and enhance the capability of LLMs to express uncertainty effectively.

**Method:** Development of the UNCLE benchmark, encompassing 4k long-form and over 20k short-form QA instances, along with new metrics to assess uncertainty expression in LLM outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the UNCLE benchmark for uncertainty evaluation in LLMs
	2. Development of metrics to assess models' uncertainty expression
	3. Demonstration of models' limitations in uncertainty expression and potential enhancement strategies

**Result:** Current LLMs are shown to inadequately express uncertainty in long-form generation. Training-based improvement methods outperform prompt-based methods in addressing this issue.

**Limitations:** Study focuses primarily on LLMs and may not generalize to other AI models; further practical implementations of proposed methods need exploration.

**Conclusion:** UNCLE serves as a critical tool for evaluating and enhancing LLMs' ability to express uncertainty, guiding future research in this area.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs' ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA). UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research using UNCLE.

### [133] [Latent Principle Discovery for Language Model Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16927)

*Keshav Ramji, Tahira Naseem, Ramón Fernandez Astudillo*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Language Models, Self-Correction, Behavioral Attributes, Automated Annotation, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a method for automating the curation of behavioral principles for language models by eliciting latent attributes and using self-correction to enhance model outputs.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Improving the quality of language model generations by specifying concrete behavioral attributes is labor-intensive. Automating this process can enhance the usability of models across various domains.

**Method:** The authors propose a self-correction approach that uses posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to identify and cluster latent attributes from the language model, allowing it to refine its responses based on these principles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Elicitation of latent attributes from the language model.
	2. Implementation of a self-correction mechanism for response refinement.
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements in smaller language models.

**Result:** The proposed method demonstrates improvements in smaller language models (7-8B parameters), achieving significant upticks in performance metrics: +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, +0.3 in MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Automating principle-driven post-training processes can lead to continual self-improvement of language models, providing an interpretable framework for model enhancements.

**Abstract:** When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

**Motivation:** The need for effective watermarking techniques in the context of large language models (LLMs) for applications such as academic peer review, where access to the AI model is often unavailable.

**Method:** The authors introduce four ICW strategies that embed watermarks in generated text through prompt engineering and pair them with tailored detection methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of In-Context Watermarking (ICW) technique
	2. Development of multiple ICW strategies paired with detection methods
	3. Validation of ICW's feasibility in real-world applications

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ICW as a model-agnostic watermarking approach that is practical and performs well in detection scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ICW provides a promising method for scalable and accessible content attribution in AI-generated text, especially as LLM capabilities advance.

**Abstract:** The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for sensitive applications has highlighted the need for effective watermarking techniques to ensure the provenance and accountability of AI-generated text. However, most existing watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method. We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input documents such as academic manuscripts. Our experiments validate the feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach. Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient language models that perform well in low-resource languages while being significantly smaller and faster to deploy.

**Method:** A systematic combination of two-step knowledge distillation, structured pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming to compress language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Combines multiple compression techniques for language models

**Result:** Achieved compression rates of up to 92% with only a marginal performance drop of 2-10% in downstream tasks across three low-resource languages.

**Limitations:** Performance degradation varies with the amount of language-specific data in the teacher model, which may limit applicability in extremely low-data scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods demonstrate that significant model compression is feasible while retaining essential language-specific knowledge, especially when using larger datasets.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we combine two-step knowledge distillation, structured pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming for extremely compressing multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. Our novel approach systematically combines existing techniques and takes them to the extreme, reducing layer depth, feed-forward hidden size, and intermediate layer embedding size to create significantly smaller monolingual models while retaining essential language-specific knowledge. We achieve compression rates of up to 92% with only a marginal performance drop of 2-10% in four downstream tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, across three low-resource languages. Notably, the performance degradation correlates with the amount of language-specific data in the teacher model, with larger datasets resulting in smaller performance losses. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to identify best practices for multilingual model compression using these techniques.

**Conclusion:** The BP-Seg method presents a significant advancement in unsupervised text segmentation by leveraging semantic relationships, offering improved performance in practical applications.

**Abstract:** Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence, capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of improving ASR systems in diverse languages with limited resources, leveraging synthetic speech to scale up training data.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** The pipeline successfully generated over 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages, leading to a reduction in transcription error rates of over 30% when pre-training the Whisper-large-v3 model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Speech Back-Translation is a scalable and effective approach to enhance the performance of multilingual ASR systems, especially in languages with limited resources.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR systems.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** VeriFastScore improves long-form factuality evaluation by simultaneously extracting and verifying claims with a fine-tuned Llama3.1 model, achieving significant speedup over existing methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the practicality of factuality evaluation metrics like VeriScore and FactScore, which are limited by extensive LLM calls and long evaluation times.

**Method:** VeriFastScore fine-tunes Llama3.1 8B to extract and verify verifiable claims within a text using evidence from Google Search, addressing the limitations of few-shot prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces VeriFastScore for simultaneous claim extraction and verification
	2. Achieves significant speedup over existing verification metrics
	3. Public release of the model and synthetic datasets for research purposes

**Result:** The fine-tuned VeriFastScore model shows strong correlation with the VeriScore pipeline at r=0.80 (example level) and r=0.94 (system level), achieving a speedup of 6.6x overall and 9.9x excluding evidence retrieval.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** VeriFastScore significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of factuality evaluation in LLMs, and the model and datasets are publicly released for future research.

**Abstract:** Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore, which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives ~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims, judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level (r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the adaptation of batch-oriented LLMs to streaming without the need for expensive re-encoding processes.

**Method:** The authors analyze three mismatches in LLM adaptation and propose a group position encoding paradigm that focuses on preserving relative positions instead of absolute order, based on extensive experimental validation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified critical mismatches in streaming adaptation of LLMs.
	2. Proposed a scalable group position encoding paradigm for enhanced streaming performance.
	3. Demonstrated strong performance across multiple tasks without altering the LLM architecture.

**Result:** The proposed method shows improved performance on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks while requiring no architectural modifications.

**Limitations:** The study is focused on specific tasks and may need further validation in broader contexts.

**Conclusion:** Adapting LLMs for streaming can be achieved effectively with the proposed position encoding technique, enhancing both performance and generalization across different modalities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing. Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming: (1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches. While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming and batch modes. The code is available at repository https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

**Motivation:** The paper aims to enhance emotional support generation in conversational agents by addressing psychological errors that persist in existing models.

**Method:** The authors introduce Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to create high-quality preference data, forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset, and propose a Decoupled framework that separates strategy planning from response generation, utilizing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) for high-quality preference data creation.
	2. Development of the IPM-PrefDial dataset specifically for Emotional Support Conversations.
	3. Proposal of a Decoupled ESC framework that separates tasks to improve model training.

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Decoupled ESC framework significantly outperforms joint optimization approaches, reducing preference bias and enhancing the quality of responses.

**Limitations:** The paper does not discuss the long-term usability or applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods effectively tackle the challenges associated with emotional support conversation tasks and lead to better model performance in generating empathetic responses.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still persist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content, making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2) Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data, forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks: strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response quality.

	2. Identification of model performance variation based on the application of formal language vs. informal language.
	3. Introduction of enhanced training data methodologies for small language models.

**Result:** Thinking models significantly outperform Instruct models, all LLMs show limitations in inductive reasoning, and PoT format data provides best generalization performance; enhanced training data improves small model performance.

**Limitations:** Current evaluations reveal inherent limitations in inductive reasoning capabilities across all LLMs.

**Conclusion:** A simple rejected fine-tuning method can enable LLMs to better generalize across formal languages and enhance overall performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models, and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the best overall performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework enriches the model's internal knowledge, improving the efficiency of retrieval-augmented reasoning.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly, or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++ outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient retrieval. The code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/R1-Searcher-plus.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a unified embedding model using pre-trained multilingual large language models for various tasks like retrieval and classification, demonstrating its effectiveness across languages.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for a unified embedding model is emphasized due to the diverse applications of LLMs that span various natural and programming languages.

**Method:** The authors propose straightforward strategies for constructing embedders and introduce a universal evaluation benchmark.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a unified embedding model for various LLM applications
	2. Introduces a universal evaluation benchmark for assessing embedding models
	3. Demonstrates effectiveness across languages with limited data

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that the trained model generates good embeddings across languages and tasks, even without additional fine-tuning or pretraining data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support the development of robust open-source universal embedders to enhance performance in various scenarios.

**Abstract:** In the large language model (LLM) revolution, embedding is a key component of various systems, such as retrieving knowledge or memories for LLMs or building content moderation filters. As such cases span from English to other natural or programming languages, from retrieval to classification and beyond, it is advantageous to build a unified embedding model rather than dedicated ones for each scenario. In this context, the pre-trained multilingual decoder-only large language models, e.g., BLOOM, emerge as a viable backbone option. To assess their potential, we propose straightforward strategies for constructing embedders and introduce a universal evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show that our trained model is proficient at generating good embeddings across languages and tasks, even extending to languages and tasks for which no finetuning/pretraining data is available. We also present detailed analyses and additional evaluations. We hope that this work could encourage the development of more robust open-source universal embedders.

**Keywords:** instruction tuning, miscalibration, self-ensembling, language models, low-resource learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the miscalibration problem in instruction-tuned language models in low-resource settings, showing that self-ensembling techniques can improve both the calibration of predictions and task performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand if instruction-tuned language models maintain calibration without overconfidence in low-resource environments, given their strong instruction following abilities.

**Method:** Extensive controlled experiments were conducted across various learning methods to analyze performance and calibration, focusing on self-ensembling at different modeling stages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. In-depth analysis of miscalibration in instruction-tuned models.
	2. Empirical evidence showing self-ensembling improves model performance and calibration.
	3. Practical guidelines for choosing appropriate learning paradigms based on data exposure.

**Result:** Self-ensembling with max probability led to robust and calibrated predictions, highlighting the miscalibration problem in all studied methods.

**Limitations:** Focus primarily on low-resource settings; may not generalize to high-resource setups.

**Conclusion:** The study reveals the calibration issues in instruction-tuned language models and suggests self-ensembling as a viable strategy to enhance both task performance and calibration.

**Abstract:** When adapting ICL with or without fine-tuning, we are curious about whether the instruction-tuned language model is able to achieve well-calibrated results without suffering from the problem of overconfidence (i.e., miscalibration) considering its strong instruction following ability, especially in such limited data setups. In this work, we deliver an in-depth analysis of the behavior across different choices of learning methods from the perspective of both performance and calibration. Through extensive controlled experiments, we observe that the miscalibration problem exists across all learning methods in low-resource setups. To achieve simultaneous gain for both in-task performance and calibration, we then study the potential of self-ensembling applied at different modeling stages (e.g., variations of in-context examples or variations in prompts or different ensembling strategies) to make the predictions more calibrated and have comparable or even better performance. We find that self-ensembling with max probability produces robust and calibrated predictions. Our work reveals the potential calibration problem of using ICL despite the improvements in task performance and sheds light on which learning paradigm to choose. We also provide practical guidelines for choosing learning paradigms depending on whether the data has been seen by the model before and a worthwhile solution via self-ensembling on how to enhance both task performance and calibration of LMs, which we hope could encourage further study.

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods demonstrate significant improvements in entity linking performance, confirming the potential of utilizing prompt engineering in conjunction with LLMs for both supervised and unsupervised settings.

**Abstract:** Entity Linking in natural language processing seeks to match text entities to their corresponding entries in a dictionary or knowledge base. Traditional approaches rely on contextual models, which can be complex, hard to train, and have limited transferability across different domains. Generative large language models like GPT offer a promising alternative but often underperform with naive prompts. In this study, we introduce EntGPT, employing advanced prompt engineering to enhance EL tasks. Our three-step hard-prompting method (EntGPT-P) significantly boosts the micro-F_1 score by up to 36% over vanilla prompts, achieving competitive performance across 10 datasets without supervised fine-tuning. Additionally, our instruction tuning method (EntGPT-I) improves micro-F_1 scores by 2.1% on average in supervised EL tasks and outperforms several baseline models in six Question Answering tasks. Our methods are compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. All data and code are available on GitHub at https://github.com/yifding/In_Context_EL.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents two novel methods for red-teaming AI systems to identify and mitigate social bias in language models, emphasizing the importance of thorough bias evaluation before deployment.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the critical need for ensuring AI system safety in industry settings, particularly by evaluating social bias that may lead to operational and reputational risks.

**Method:** The authors introduce two bias-specific red-teaming methods: Emotional Bias Probe (EBP) and BiasKG, the latter using a knowledge graph to refactor natural language stereotypes, and employ these methods to induce biased responses from various language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of two novel red-teaming methods (EBP and BiasKG) targeting social bias in AI systems
	2. Demonstration of increased bias in language models even with existing safety measures
	3. Recommendations for improving AI safety assessment in industry settings

**Result:** The findings demonstrate that both methods increase bias in all evaluated models, including those equipped with safety guardrails, thus highlighting the inadequacies of current safety measures in addressing social bias.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work underscores the need for better evaluation measures to uncover societal bias in language models and recommends strategies to ensure AI safety during industry deployment.

**Abstract:** Ensuring the safe deployment of AI systems is critical in industry settings where biased outputs can lead to significant operational, reputational, and regulatory risks. Thorough evaluation before deployment is essential to prevent these hazards. Red-teaming addresses this need by employing adversarial attacks to develop guardrails that detect and reject biased or harmful queries, enabling models to be retrained or steered away from harmful outputs. However, most red-teaming efforts focus on harmful or unethical instructions rather than addressing social bias, leaving this critical area under-explored despite its significant real-world impact, especially in customer-facing systems. We propose two bias-specific red-teaming methods, Emotional Bias Probe (EBP) and BiasKG, to evaluate how standard safety measures for harmful content affect bias. For BiasKG, we refactor natural language stereotypes into a knowledge graph. We use these attacking strategies to induce biased responses from several open- and closed-source language models. Unlike prior work, these methods specifically target social bias. We find our method increases bias in all models, even those trained with safety guardrails. Our work emphasizes uncovering societal bias in LLMs through rigorous evaluation, and recommends measures ensure AI safety in high-stakes industry deployments.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces BlockPruner, a novel pruning method for large language models that targets redundancies within multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron blocks, leading to more efficient model performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing costs associated with training and inference of large language models necessitate more efficient pruning methods to reduce redundancy without affecting performance.

**Method:** BlockPruner segments Transformer layers into MHA and MLP blocks, evaluates their importance using perplexity measures, and employs heuristic search for iterative pruning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BlockPruner for fine-grained pruning of LLMs
	2. Assessment of block importance using perplexity measures
	3. Demonstration of superior performance in various tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Result:** BlockPruner was applied to various LLMs, demonstrating more granular and effective pruning compared to existing methods, validated across numerous downstream tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed pruning approach can significantly reduce the complexity of LLMs while maintaining their performance, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional layer pruning methods.

**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models (LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated significantly. Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MMMU-Pro serves as a better evaluation framework for multimodal AI, suggesting avenues for future research.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces MMMU-Pro, a robust version of the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning (MMMU) benchmark. MMMU-Pro rigorously assesses multimodal models' true understanding and reasoning capabilities through a three-step process based on MMMU: (1) filtering out questions answerable by text-only models, (2) augmenting candidate options, and (3) introducing a vision-only input setting where questions are embedded within images. This setting challenges AI to truly "see" and "read" simultaneously, testing a fundamental human cognitive skill of seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. Results show that model performance is substantially lower on MMMU-Pro than on MMMU, ranging from 16.8% to 26.9% across models. We explore the impact of OCR prompts and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, finding that OCR prompts have minimal effect while CoT generally improves performance. MMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool, closely mimicking real-world scenarios and offering valuable directions for future research in multimodal AI.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The new normal forms contribute to a deeper understanding of the computing power of virus machines.

**Abstract:** In the present work, we further study the computational power of virus machines (VMs in short).VMs provide a computing paradigm inspired by the transmission and replication networks of viruses.VMs consist of process units (called hosts) structured by a directed graph whose arcs are called channels and an instruction graph that controls the transmissions of virus objects among hosts. The present work complements our understanding of the computing power of VMs by introducing normal forms; these expressions restrict the features in a given computing model.Some of the features that we restrict in our normal forms include (a) the number of hosts, (b) the number of instructions, and (c) the number of virus objects in each host. After we recall some known results on the computing power of VMs we give our series of normal forms, such as the size of the loops in the network, proving new characterisations of family of sets, such as finite sets, semilinear sets, or recursively enumerable sets (NRE).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current multilingual pretrained models often neglect language embeddings, which burdens token representations and compromises language neutrality.

**Method:** LangSAMP integrates both language and script embeddings into the output of Transformer blocks enhancing the learning process during the continual pretraining of XLM-R.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces LangSAMP for improved multilingual representation learning.
	2. Enhances zero-shot crosslingual transfer performance through integrated embeddings.
	3. Offers publicly available implementation for further research and application.

**Result:** The model extends performance over the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across a variety of tasks, succeeding in nuanced representation learning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Utilizing language and script embeddings fosters better language-neutral representations and aids in selecting more suitable source languages for crosslingual transfer.

**Abstract:** Recent multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) often avoid using language embeddings -- learnable vectors assigned to individual languages. However, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture language- and script-specific nuances, which benefits more language-neutral representations, proven by improved pairwise cosine similarity. In our case study, we also show that language and script embeddings can be used to select better source languages for crosslingual transfer. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/cisnlp/LangSAMP.

**Motivation:** To explore the rationality and performance of LLM-based agents in economic contexts and their implications for real-world applications like online retail and recommender systems.

**Method:** The authors define three families of two-player, sequential, language-based games with consistent parameters. An open-source framework is developed for simulating interactions, along with a dataset for LLM vs. LLM and human vs. LLM interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a standardized benchmark for LLM interactions in economic games
	2. Creation of an open-source framework for simulation and data collection
	3. Comprehensive datasets for comparing LLM and human behaviors in economic contexts

**Result:** The experiments reveal that economic parameters and LLM choice have complex interdependent effects on outcomes such as efficiency and fairness in interactions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Designing and analyzing the language-based economic ecosystem requires attention to the intricate relationships between LLM behavior, economic environments, and game parameters.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in economic and strategic interactions, where communication via natural language is often prevalent. This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? How do they perform compared to humans? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. To answer these questions, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents. Our results suggest that the market parameters, as well as the choice of the LLMs, tend to have complex and interdependent effects on the economic outcome, which calls for careful design and analysis of the language-based economic ecosystem.

**Motivation:** Existing benchmarks for LLMs integrating KGs focus on closed-ended tasks, lacking evaluation for complex real-world scenarios and not assessing hallucination issues adequately.

**Method:** The paper proposes the OKGQA benchmark for open-ended question answering with diverse question types and metrics for hallucination rates and reasoning improvements. A variant, OKGQA-P, is introduced to evaluate performance when KGs contain errors.

**Key Contributions:**

	2. Development of the OKGQA-P variant for assessing error-prone KGs
	3. Metrics for quantifying hallucination rates and reasoning capabilities in LLM+KG models

**Result:** OKGQA allows for a more detailed performance comparison of LLMs with KGs in real-world tasks, revealing how KGs can reduce hallucinations and enhance trustworthiness in LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study promotes ongoing enhancements in the integration of KGs with LLMs, addressing hallucination concerns and advancing the reliability of these models.

**Abstract:** Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs' potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on method design. We believe this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourages continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs to mitigate hallucination, and make LLMs more trustworthy.

	3. Extensive testing with various LLMs and datasets showing significant improvements

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that REP improves success rates in robustness tests by up to 66.4% while keeping the success rate constant across various editing methods and datasets.

**Limitations:** Potential computational overhead introduced by the dynamic adjustment of keys.

**Conclusion:** REP effectively addresses the limitations of current edit methods, leading to substantial improvements in LLM memory editing without sacrificing accuracy.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) struggle with maintaining accurate knowledge due to conflicting/outdated parametric memories. While locate-and-edit methods address this, their reliance on models' internal representations leads to robustness failures in long-context reasoning and paraphrased queries. We identify a fundamental limitation of locate-and-edit methods: existing semantic keys (for memory localization) cannot simultaneously satisfy robustness (context-invariant activation) and specificity (precise knowledge discrimination). Through theoretical error-bound analysis, we establish formal criteria for effective editing. Our solution introduces \textit{Robust Edit Pathway (REP)}, a plug-and-play module that: (1) disentangles editing keys from native model representations; (2) dynamically adjusts keys via contrastive learning to achieve robustness-specificity balance. Extensive experiments across various editing methods (ROME/MEMIT/R-ROME/EMMET), existing LLMs (LLaMA2, QWen, Mistral), and datasets (CounterFact, ZsRE) show that REP improves success rate over robustness tests by up-to 66.4\% while maintaining the success rate unaffected.

### [158] [A Unified Approach to Routing and Cascading for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10347)

*Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** model selection, large language models, cascade routing, cost-performance tradeoff, quality estimators

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel framework called cascade routing that combines routing and cascading strategies for effective model selection in large language models, proving their optimality and showing significant performance improvements.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing model selection strategies which include lack of optimality proofs, inability to determine effective conditions, and the failure to integrate routing and cascading approaches.

**Method:** The authors derive a new optimal strategy for cascading and prove the existing routing strategy's optimality, followed by proposing a unified framework called cascade routing that integrates both strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Derivation of a novel optimal strategy for cascading models
	2. Proof of optimality for an existing routing strategy
	3. Development of cascade routing framework that integrates routing and cascading approaches

**Result:** Cascade routing consistently outperforms both routing and cascading strategies in terms of cost-performance tradeoff, underpinning the importance of quality estimators in model selection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed cascade routing offers a theoretically optimal model selection strategy and demonstrates the critical role of quality estimators in enhancing performance.

**Abstract:** The availability of a wide range of large language models (LLMs) embedded in various agentic systems has significantly increased the potential of model selection strategies to improve the cost-performance tradeoff. Existing strategies involve either routing, where a single model is chosen per query, or cascading, which sequentially runs increasingly larger models until a satisfactory answer is found. However, current approaches face three key limitations: they (1) lack formal proofs of optimality, (2) fail to identify the conditions under which these strategies are most effective to improve the cost-performance tradeoff, and (3) are unable to combine both paradigms for further improvements. To address these issues, we first derive a novel optimal strategy for cascading and prove the optimality of an existing routing strategy. Further, we propose cascade routing, a unified framework that integrates routing and cascading into a theoretically optimal strategy. Through our analysis, we identify good quality estimators as the critical factor for the success of model selection paradigms. Finally, in our experiments, we show that cascade routing consistently outperforms the individual approaches by a large margin and we analyze quality estimators to determine when routing and/or cascading are useful paradigms for model selection.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, hallucination, model architecture, inductive biases, computational limitations

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the relationship between model architecture and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate information, highlighting significant differences in hallucination types across architectures.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how changes in architecture influence the propensity for LLMs to hallucinate and to address the dual concerns of hallucination reliability and computational limitations.

**Method:** An extensive evaluation of different LLM architectures, particularly comparing traditional self-attention based models and recurrent models, focusing on how these architectures affect the occurrence of hallucinations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified significant differences in hallucination types based on LLM architecture.
	2. Provided evidence that model architecture can influence the propensity for hallucinations.
	3. Highlighted the need to concurrently address hallucination concerns and architectural limitations.

**Result:** The study finds that while hallucinations are a common issue across LLMs, the frequency and nature of hallucinations vary significantly with model architecture, indicating a need for integrated strategies in LLM design.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on the architectural aspects of hallucinations and may not cover other contributing factors.

**Conclusion:** A deeper understanding of the interplay between architecture and hallucination types is essential for developing more robust techniques to mitigate hallucination risks in LLMs.

**Abstract:** The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to hallucinate false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the ease with which specific types of hallucinations can be induced can significantly differ based on the model architecture. These findings highlight the need for better understanding both these problems in conjunction with each other, as well as consider how to design more universal techniques for handling hallucinations.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning language models with synthetic long-context data on downstream retrieval tasks, revealing insights about attention heads involved in performance.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the effectiveness of synthetic context extension for long-context tasks in language models and identify how this affects retrieval abilities.

**Method:** The study fine-tunes models on synthetic data with varying realism and diversity of contexts and evaluates performance on long-context retrieval tasks, analyzing the role of attention heads.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of the impact of synthetic context fine-tuning on model performance.
	2. Identification of retrieval heads and their correlation with retrieval effectiveness.
	3. Mechanistic explanation of model performance variations based on attention knockout experiments.

**Result:** Models fine-tuned on synthetic data perform worse than those trained on real data, but the performance can be predicted by the behavior of specific attention heads related to retrieval tasks.

**Limitations:** Models trained on synthetic data consistently underperform compared to those trained on real data, indicating limitations in realism and validation.

**Conclusion:** Synthetic data fine-tuning can inform model performance but needs better strategies to create realistic training data to enhance long-context task capabilities.

**Abstract:** Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.

**Motivation:** To evaluate the performance of LLMs in research-specific tasks where they can assist researchers.

**Method:** Development of a benchmark dataset called AAAR-1.0 which includes tasks like EquationInference, ExperimentDesign, PaperWeakness, and REVIEWCRITIQUE.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AAAR-1.0 benchmark tailored for research tasks
	2. Focus on expertise-intensive tasks for researchers
	3. Evaluation of LLMs in researcher-oriented activities

**Result:** Evaluation shows potential and limitations of various LLMs in performing sophisticated research tasks.

**Limitations:** Limited to specific research tasks; ongoing iterations may be required.

**Conclusion:** AAAR-1.0 provides a specialized approach to assessing LLM capabilities in research contexts and will be iteratively improved.

**Abstract:** Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach enhances the reliability of confidence estimation for LLM responses, which is vital in high-risk applications.

**Abstract:** Reliable confidence estimation is essential for enhancing the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes scenarios. Despite its importance, accurately estimating confidence in LLM responses remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose using an auxiliary learning model to assess response correctness based on the self-consistency of multiple outputs generated by the LLM. Our method builds a consistency graph to represent the agreement among multiple responses and uses a graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the likelihood that each response is correct. Experiments demonstrate that this method has strong calibration performance on various benchmark datasets and generalizes well to out-of-domain cases.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of hallucination detectors trained on specific domains, which often struggle to generalize across different domains.

**Method:** The authors proposed PRISM, a prompt-guided framework that modifies LLM internal states to enhance the salience and consistency of text truthfulness across domains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of PRISM framework for hallucination detection

	3. Experimental validation across multiple datasets

**Result:** The experimental results demonstrate that PRISM significantly improves the cross-domain generalization of hallucination detection methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating PRISM with existing hallucination detection techniques leads to better performance in recognizing factually incorrect outputs from LLMs across diverse domains.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks in different domains. However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes to the structure related to text truthfulness in LLMs' internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains. We integrated our framework with existing hallucination detection methods and conducted experiments on datasets from different domains. The experimental results indicate that our framework significantly enhances the cross-domain generalization of existing hallucination detection methods.

**Conclusion:** This new evaluation approach can enhance the quality assessment of AI-generated medical reports by integrating both textual content and corresponding visual data.

**Abstract:** Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the AusLaw Citation Benchmark, a dataset for legal citation prediction using LLMs, and evaluates various methods, finding that instruction tuning on task-specific datasets yields the best performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Legal citation prediction is a significant yet under-explored task that requires deep contextual understanding. The introduction of a comprehensive dataset aims to advance research in this area.

**Method:** The paper benchmarks several approaches which include standard prompting of LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines, supervised fine-tuning, and hybrid strategies combining LLMs with retrieval techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the AusLaw Citation Benchmark dataset for legal citation prediction.
	2. Evaluated multiple methods for citation prediction, finding instruction tuning and hybrid methods most effective.
	3. Identified key factors affecting performance, including database granularity and type of embeddings.

**Result:** The study found that both general and law-specific LLMs perform poorly as standalone solutions, with the best results from instruction tuning on a task-specific dataset and hybrid methods utilizing trained re-rankers.

**Limitations:** There remains a significant performance gap of nearly 50%, indicating that current methods are not sufficient for optimal citation prediction.

**Conclusion:** The AusLaw Citation Benchmark highlights the challenges in legal citation prediction and indicates significant room for improvement, serving as a foundation for future research in the legal domain.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential across legal tasks, yet the problem of legal citation prediction remains under-explored. At its core, this task demands fine-grained contextual understanding and precise identification of relevant legislation or precedent. We introduce the AusLaw Citation Benchmark, a real-world dataset comprising 55k Australian legal instances and 18,677 unique citations which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its scale and scope. We then conduct a systematic benchmarking across a range of solutions: (i) standard prompting of both general and law-specialised LLMs, (ii) retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, (iii) supervised fine-tuning, and (iv) several hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation through query expansion, voting ensembles, or re-ranking. Results show that neither general nor law-specific LLMs suffice as stand-alone solutions, with performance near zero. Instruction tuning (of even a generic open-source LLM) on task-specific dataset is among the best performing solutions. We highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in retrieval-based approaches, with hybrid methods which utilise a trained re-ranker delivering the best results. Despite this, a performance gap of nearly 50% remains, underscoring the value of this challenging benchmark as a rigorous test-bed for future research in legal-domain.

**Limitations:** The study may have limitations in the generalizability of the reader agents across diverse cultures and contexts.

**Conclusion:** Incorporating reader feedback in emotion analysis significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of personalized implicit emotion detection.

**Abstract:** The subtlety of emotional expressions makes implicit emotion analysis (IEA) particularly sensitive to user-specific characteristics. Current studies personalize emotion analysis by focusing on the author but neglect the impact of the intended reader on implicit emotional feedback. In this paper, we introduce Personalized IEA (PIEA) and present the RAPPIE model, which addresses subjective variability by incorporating reader feedback. In particular, (1) we create reader agents based on large language models to simulate reader feedback, overcoming the issue of ``spiral of silence effect'' and data incompleteness of real reader reaction. (2) We develop a role-aware multi-view graph learning to model the emotion interactive propagation process in scenarios with sparse reader information. (3) We construct two new PIEA datasets covering English and Chinese social media with detailed user metadata, addressing the text-centric limitation of existing datasets. Extensive experiments show that RAPPIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of incorporating reader feedback in PIEA.

**Conclusion:** LITA offers an efficient and adaptable framework for advancing topic modeling and text clustering.

**Abstract:** Topic modeling is widely used for uncovering thematic structures within text corpora, yet traditional models often struggle with specificity and coherence in domain-focused applications. Guided approaches, such as SeededLDA and CorEx, incorporate user-provided seed words to improve relevance but remain labor-intensive and static. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for dynamic topic refinement and discovery, yet their application often incurs high API costs. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation framework (LITA), an LLM-assisted approach that integrates user-provided seeds with embedding-based clustering and iterative refinement. LITA identifies a small number of ambiguous documents and employs an LLM to reassign them to existing or new topics, minimizing API costs while enhancing topic quality. Experiments on two datasets across topic quality and clustering performance metrics demonstrate that LITA outperforms five baseline models, including LDA, SeededLDA, CorEx, BERTopic, and PromptTopic. Our work offers an efficient and adaptable framework for advancing topic modeling and text clustering.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method and dataset provide significant advancements in the detection of vulnerabilities in LLMs, paving the way for more robust security measures.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various fields of society due to their powerful reasoning, understanding, and generation capabilities. However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.

**Abstract:** We present BenCzechMark (BCM), the first comprehensive Czech language benchmark designed for large language models, offering diverse tasks, multiple task formats, and multiple evaluation metrics. Its duel scoring system is grounded in statistical significance theory and uses aggregation across tasks inspired by social preference theory. Our benchmark encompasses 50 challenging tasks, with corresponding test datasets, primarily in native Czech, with 14 newly collected ones. These tasks span 8 categories and cover diverse domains, including historical Czech news, essays from pupils or language learners, and spoken word. Furthermore, we collect and clean BUT-Large Czech Collection, the largest publicly available clean Czech language corpus, and use it for (i) contamination analysis and (ii) continuous pretraining of the first Czech-centric 7B language model with Czech-specific tokenization. We use our model as a baseline for comparison with publicly available multilingual models. Lastly, we release and maintain a leaderboard with existing 50 model submissions, where new model submissions can be made at https://huggingface.co/spaces/CZLC/BenCzechMark.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Introducing Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO) to enhance response diversity in language models during creative tasks without sacrificing quality.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current post-training methods reduce response diversity, which is problematic for creative tasks that require varied outputs.

**Method:** DivPO selects preference pairs from a pool of responses, focusing on those that are rare yet high quality versus common but low quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO) for language models.
	2. Demonstrates significant increases in response diversity while maintaining quality.
	3. Establishes a new approach for selecting diverse preference pairs.

**Result:** DivPO generates 45.6% more diverse persona attributes and 74.6% more story diversity while maintaining win rates.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DivPO offers significant improvements in response diversity for language models, applicable in guiding creative tasks effectively.

**Abstract:** Post-training of language models, either through reinforcement learning, preference optimization or supervised finetuning, tends to sharpen the output probability distribution and reduce the diversity of generated responses. This is particularly a problem for creative generative tasks where varied responses are desired. In this work we introduce Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO), an optimization method which learns to generate much more diverse responses than standard pipelines, while maintaining the quality of the generations. In DivPO, preference pairs are selected by first considering a pool of responses, and a measure of diversity among them, and selecting chosen examples as being more rare but high quality, while rejected examples are more common, but low quality. DivPO results in generating 45.6% more diverse persona attributes, and a 74.6% increase in story diversity, while maintaining similar win rates as standard baselines. On general instruction following, DivPO results in a 46.2% increase in diversity, and a 2.4% winrate improvement compared to DPO.

**Conclusion:** ReFoRCE significantly improves the ability to perform complex natural language queries over structured data.

**Abstract:** We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.

**Motivation:** To improve the efficiency of large language model pretraining through better selection of high-quality training data.

**Method:** FIRE integrates multiple data quality raters into a unified framework and uses a progressive data selection scheme for iterative refinement of data quality selection.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** FIRE outperforms existing data selection methods and enhances pretrained model performance, achieving target performance with significantly less training data compared to the Random baseline.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** FIRE provides a comprehensive approach to data quality evaluation and selection, leading to improved outcomes in various downstream tasks.

**Abstract:** Selecting high-quality data can improve the pretraining efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods generally rely on heuristic techniques or single quality signals, limiting their ability to evaluate data quality comprehensively. In this work, we propose FIRE, a flexible and scalable framework for integrating multiple data quality raters, which allows for a comprehensive assessment of data quality across various dimensions. FIRE aligns multiple quality signals into a unified space, and integrates diverse data quality raters to provide a comprehensive quality signal for each data point. Further, we introduce a progressive data selection scheme based on FIRE that iteratively refines the selection of high-quality data points. Extensive experiments show that FIRE outperforms other data selection methods and significantly boosts pretrained model performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, while requiring less than 37.5\% of the training data needed by the Random baseline to reach the target performance.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Data Diversity, Fine-tuning, Contrastive Data Pools, Feedback-driven Co-design

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the impact of data diversity on fine-tuning large language models and proposes a method that utilizes a dual model identity to enhance performance across domains.

**Read time:** 25 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Fine-tuning LLMs effectively requires addressing issues with data composition, especially when domain labels are missing or imprecise.

**Method:** The study creates contrastive data pools and proposes a dual identity model for LLMs—an output model for selecting diverse data and an input model for tuning with that data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of data diversity's role in LLM performance.
	2. Proposed dual identity model for improved data selection and tuning.
	3. Empirical evidence showing performance boosts across various domains.

**Result:** The proposed method significantly improves performance on domain-undetermined data and foundational downstream tasks across various advanced LLMs.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the method in domains with fully normalized data remains untested.

**Conclusion:** This research enhances understanding of data diversity's role in LLM fine-tuning and emphasizes feedback-driven co-design between data and models.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this work, we investigate the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-design for LLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT) for evaluating LLMs in the cognitive process of conceptual combination.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gaps in understanding the generative process of conceptual combination and evaluate LLMs on this task.

**Method:** Three tasks are established using the CCPT dataset, which contains 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types, to assess LLM performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CCPT dataset for evaluating conceptual combination in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of a correlation between automatic grading metrics and human judgments
	3. Development of a cognitive psychology-inspired method that improves LLM performance in generative tasks.

**Result:** The study finds that automatic metrics for grading property emergence correlate with human judgments, while LLMs struggle to generate noun phrases with specified emergent properties. A method based on cognitive psychology improves generative task performance.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on noun phrases and may not generalize to other types of linguistic expressions.

**Conclusion:** The proposed CCPT dataset and evaluation methods enhance understanding of conceptual combination and LLM capabilities, contributing to AI and cognitive modeling fields.

**Abstract:** Conceptual combination is a cognitive process that merges basic concepts, enabling the creation of complex expressions. During this process, the properties of combination (e.g., the whiteness of a peeled apple) can be inherited from basic concepts, newly emerge, or be canceled. However, previous studies have evaluated a limited set of properties and have not examined the generative process. To address this gap, we introduce the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT), which consists of 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types. Using CCPT, we establish three types of tasks to evaluate LLMs for conceptual combination thoroughly. Our key findings are threefold: (1) Our automatic metric grading property emergence and cancellation closely corresponds with human judgments. (2) LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, struggle to generate noun phrases which possess given emergent properties. (3) Our proposed method, inspired by cognitive psychology model that explains how relationships between concepts are formed, improves performances in all generative tasks. The dataset and experimental code are available at https://github.com/seokwon99/CCPT.git.

**TL;DR:** Proposes Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC) to improve LLMs' handling of long sequences without retraining.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle with long contexts due to fixed-length position embeddings and high computational costs.

**Method:** Introduced LCIRC to efficiently process long sequences through recurrent compression and query dependent context modeling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced the LCIRC method for long-form sequence processing
	2. Developed query dependent context modeling for selective compression
	3. Demonstrated significant improvements in managing long contexts with QD-LCIRC

**Result:** Empirical results show that QD-LCIRC enhances LLMs' capabilities in managing extended contexts effectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method allows for better context understanding in tasks requiring comprehensive information and query relevance.

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent and contextually rich outputs, their capacity to efficiently handle long-form contexts is limited by fixed-length position embeddings. Additionally, the computational cost of processing long sequences increases quadratically, making it challenging to extend context length. To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model. We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content. Our empirical results demonstrate that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly improves LLM's ability to manage extended contexts, making it well-suited for tasks that require both comprehensive context understanding and query relevance.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges faced in aligning retrievers and large language models in RAG systems, leading to sub-optimal performance in existing methods.

**Method:** C-3PO employs a proxy-centric framework with three specialized agents that optimize the RAG pipeline via collaboration, using a tree-structured rollout for reinforcement learning reward assignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel proxy-centric framework for RAG systems
	2. Development of a multi-agent system to optimize integration of retrievers and LLMs
	3. Implementation of a tree-structured rollout approach for improved reinforcement learning.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that C-3PO significantly improves RAG performance in various scenarios while retaining flexibility and enhancing generalization capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** C-3PO demonstrates effective integration of retrievers and LLMs, leading to improved retrieval-augmented generation outcomes without altering the components.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face a fundamental challenge in aligning independently developed retrievers and large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically involve modifying either component or introducing simple intermediate modules, resulting in practical limitations and sub-optimal performance. Inspired by human search behavior -- typically involving a back-and-forth process of proposing search queries and reviewing documents, we propose C-3PO, a proxy-centric framework that facilitates communication between retrievers and LLMs through a lightweight multi-agent system. Our framework implements three specialized agents that collaboratively optimize the entire RAG pipeline without altering the retriever and LLMs. These agents work together to assess the need for retrieval, generate effective queries, and select information suitable for the LLMs. To enable effective multi-agent coordination, we develop a tree-structured rollout approach for reward credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios demonstrate that C-3PO significantly enhances RAG performance while maintaining plug-and-play flexibility and superior generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of different prompting strategies on LLM performance in reasoning tasks, especially regarding the use of rationales for incorrect answers.

**Method:** The study evaluates LLM performance with and without explicit rationales accompanying incorrect answers in math reasoning tasks, comparing it to chain-of-thought prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated improved LLM performance in reasoning without explicit rationales.
	2. Provided insights into overfitting to in-context rationales.
	3. Showed that incorrect answers are more beneficial than diverse correct answers alone.

**Result:** LLMs showed better performance when rationales were removed, outperforming scenarios where rationales were provided, consistent across various LLM sizes and reasoning abilities.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on math reasoning tasks, and results may vary in other contexts.

**Conclusion:** Explicit corrective rationales limit the learning benefits from incorrect answers, suggesting that LLMs can infer better without them.

**Abstract:** Showing incorrect answers to Large Language Models (LLMs) is a popular strategy to improve their performance in reasoning-intensive tasks. It is widely assumed that, in order to be helpful, the incorrect answers must be accompanied by comprehensive rationales, explicitly detailing where the mistakes are and how to correct them. However, in this work we present a counterintuitive finding: we observe that LLMs perform better in math reasoning tasks when these rationales are eliminated from the context and models are left to infer on their own what makes an incorrect answer flawed. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. These results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. To gain an understanding of why LLMs learn from mistakes more effectively without explicit corrective rationales, we perform a thorough analysis, investigating changes in context length and answer diversity between different prompting strategies, and their effect on performance. We also examine evidence of overfitting to the in-context rationales when these are provided, and study the extent to which LLMs are able to autonomously infer high-quality corrective rationales given only incorrect answers as input. We find evidence that, while incorrect answers are more beneficial for LLM learning than additional diverse correct answers, explicit corrective rationales over-constrain the model, thus limiting those benefits.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a self-supervised method for citation generation
	2. Leveraging LLM's own reward signals for improved citation quality
	3. Demonstration of effectiveness on LongBench-Cite benchmark

**Result:** SelfCite achieved an increase in citation F1 by up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach significantly enhances the quality of citations produced by LLMs, making them more useful for academic and research applications.

**Abstract:** We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the multi-dimensional aspects of safety-aligned behaviors in LLMs, specifically focusing on refusal behaviors in response to harmful queries.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the mechanistic understanding of how safety-aligned behaviors in LLMs can be represented, beyond single-direction models.

**Method:** The authors analyze the vector space of representation shifts during safety fine-tuning of Llama 3 8B, identifying key directions that control refusal behavior and testing the impact of removing trigger tokens in harmful queries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of multi-dimensional directions in LLM safety-aligned behavior.
	2. Demonstration of how secondary directions impact the dominant refusal direction.
	3. Insights on how trigger tokens can be manipulated to bypass safety features.

**Result:** The study finds that a dominant direction governs refusal behavior, while multiple smaller orthogonal directions represent distinct interpretive features; also discovering that removing certain trigger tokens can bypass safety capabilities.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on one model (Llama 3 8B) and its safety features, potentially limiting generalizability to other models.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal the complexity of safety alignment in LLMs and the importance of understanding multi-dimensional directions to better address safety vulnerabilities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models' safety-aligned behaviors, such as refusing harmful queries, can be represented by linear directions in activation space. Previous research modeled safety behavior with a single direction, limiting mechanistic understanding to an isolated safety feature. In this work, we discover that safety-aligned behavior is jointly controlled by multi-dimensional directions. Namely, we study the vector space of representation shifts during safety fine-tuning on Llama 3 8B for refusing jailbreaks. By studying orthogonal directions in the space, we first find that a dominant direction governs the model's refusal behavior, while multiple smaller directions represent distinct and interpretable features like hypothetical narrative and role-playing. We then measure how different directions promote or suppress the dominant direction, showing the important role of secondary directions in shaping the model's refusal representation. Finally, we demonstrate that removing certain trigger tokens in harmful queries can mitigate these directions to bypass the learned safety capability, providing new insights on understanding safety alignment vulnerability from a multi-dimensional perspective.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome token misalignment issues in speculative decoding for large language models, which can limit inference performance.

**Method:** GRIFFIN uses a token-alignable training strategy with a loss masking mechanism and a draft model that introduces input tokens to correct inconsistencies in output features.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel token-alignable training strategy with loss masking.
	2. Developed a token-alignable draft model for correcting generated feature inconsistencies.
	3. Demonstrated substantial performance improvements over existing methods in several models.

**Result:** Experiments show GRIFFIN achieves over 8% improvement in average acceptance length and more than 7% speedup, outperforming existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that GRIFFIN significantly enhances the performance of speculative decoding in large language models, making it a valuable contribution to the field.

**Abstract:** Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, existing methods often struggle with token misalignment between the training and decoding phases, limiting their performance. To address this, we propose GRIFFIN, a novel framework that incorporates a token-alignable training strategy and a token-alignable draft model to mitigate misalignment. The training strategy employs a loss masking mechanism to exclude highly misaligned tokens during training, preventing them from negatively impacting the draft model's optimization. The token-alignable draft model introduces input tokens to correct inconsistencies in generated features. Experiments on LLaMA, Vicuna, Qwen and Mixtral models demonstrate that GRIFFIN achieves an average acceptance length improvement of over 8% and a speedup ratio exceeding 7%, outperforming current speculative decoding state-of-the-art methods. Our code and GRIFFIN's draft models are released publicly in https://github.com/hsj576/GRIFFIN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing Text-to-SQL methods struggle in real-world scenarios without available training examples, necessitating a more robust solution.

**Method:** SAFE-SQL prompts an LLM to generate multiple relevant Text-to-SQL examples, then filters them based on three relevance assessments to create high-quality inputs for in-context learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of self-augmented examples for SQL generation
	2. Implementation of three relevance assessments for example filtering
	3. Demonstrated performance improvement in hard and unseen scenarios

**Result:** SAFE-SQL achieves higher execution accuracy than previous zero-shot and few-shot Text-to-SQL methods, especially in challenging scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The self-augmented example generation and filtering process of SAFE-SQL leads to significant improvements in SQL query generation performance.

**Abstract:** Text-to-SQL aims to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries. While previous approaches, such as skeleton-masked selection, have demonstrated strong performance by retrieving similar training examples to guide large language models (LLMs), they struggle in real-world scenarios where such examples are unavailable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Self-Augmentation in-context learning with Fine-grained Example selection for Text-to-SQL (SAFE-SQL), a novel framework that improves SQL generation by generating and filtering self-augmented examples. SAFE-SQL first prompts an LLM to generate multiple Text-to-SQL examples relevant to the test input. Then SAFE-SQL filters these examples through three relevance assessments, constructing high-quality in-context learning examples. Using self-generated examples, SAFE-SQL surpasses the previous zero-shot, and few-shot Text-to-SQL frameworks, achieving higher execution accuracy. Notably, our approach provides additional performance gains in extra hard and unseen scenarios, where conventional methods often fail.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Personalization is underexplored in story generation, yet it is crucial for enhancing user experiences in writing and education.

**Method:** A two-stage pipeline is proposed for personalized story generation: inferring authors' implicit writing characteristics into an Author Writing Sheet, and simulating the author's persona with tailored descriptions and rules.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Mythos dataset comprising 3.6k stories from 112 authors.
	2. Development of a two-stage pipeline for personalized story generation.
	3. Demonstration of significant improvements in story personalization metrics compared to a baseline.

**Result:** Personalized stories generated from the Author Writing Sheet achieved a 78% win-rate in mimicking authors' styles and 59% similarity to actual stories, validated by human evaluation.

**Limitations:** Limited exploration of the contexts in which personalization is effective and the specific challenges for various genres.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that personalization enhances story generation, with certain themes and features being more amenable to personalization.

**Abstract:** Personalization is critical for improving user experience in interactive writing and educational applications, yet remains understudied in story generation. We study the task of personalizing story generation, where our goal is to mimic an author's writing style, given other stories written by them. We collect Mythos, a dataset of 3.6k stories from 112 authors, with an average of 16 stories per author, across five distinct sources reflecting diverse story-writing settings. We propose a two-stage pipeline for personalized story generation: first, we infer authors' implicit writing characteristics and organize them into an Author Writing Sheet, which is validated by humans to be of high quality; second, we simulate the author's persona using tailored persona descriptions and personalized story rules. We find that stories personalized using the Author Writing Sheet outperform a non-personalized baseline, achieving a 78% win-rate in capturing authors' past style and 59% in similarity to ground-truth author stories. Human evaluation supports these findings and further highlights trends, such as Reddit stories being easier to personalize, and the Creativity and Language Use aspects of stories being easier to personalize than the Plot.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in evaluating generated content and the high computational cost of training vision-language reward models (VLRMs) with preference data.

**Method:** The authors propose a method that merges text-based reward models with LVLMs to create efficient VLRMs that do not require extensive training.

**Conclusion:** This approach offers an efficient way to incorporate textual preferences into LVLMs without the need for training, thereby simplifying the evaluation of generated content.

**Abstract:** Large vision-language models (LVLMs) perform outstandingly across various multimodal tasks. However, their ability to evaluate generated content remains limited, and training vision-language reward models (VLRMs) with preference data is computationally expensive. This paper explores a training-free alternative by merging text-based reward models (RMs) with LVLMs to create VLRMs. Our approach shows that integrating these models leads to improved performance over LVLMs' scoring and text-based RMs, offering an efficient method for incorporating textual preferences into LVLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** CoT-ICL Lab is a framework for generating synthetic datasets to explore chain-of-thought in-context learning in language models, demonstrating the importance of model depth and example diversity.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To systematically study chain-of-thought in-context learning in language models and understand its effects on performance.

**Method:** A framework called CoT-ICL Lab was developed to generate synthetic tokenized datasets, allowing control over in-context example complexity by separating causal structure and token processing functions. Decoder-only transformers were trained on these datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoT-ICL Lab framework
	2. Demonstration of model depth's importance in CoT
	3. Insights on token processing diversity and causal structure learning

**Result:** The study found that chain-of-thought significantly improves accuracy transitions in larger models, while depth is critical for models with few in-context examples, and diversity in token processing enhances causal structure learning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CoT-ICL Lab provides a valuable tool for gaining theoretical and empirical insights into in-context learning and chain-of-thought in language models.

**Abstract:** We introduce CoT-ICL Lab, a framework and methodology to generate synthetic tokenized datasets and systematically study chain-of-thought (CoT) in-context learning (ICL) in language models. CoT-ICL Lab allows fine grained control over the complexity of in-context examples by decoupling (1) the causal structure involved in chain token generation from (2) the underlying token processing functions. We train decoder-only transformers (up to 700M parameters) on these datasets and show that CoT accelerates the accuracy transition to higher values across model sizes. In particular, we find that model depth is crucial for leveraging CoT with limited in-context examples, while more examples help shallow models match deeper model performance. Additionally, limiting the diversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal structure learning via ICL. We also interpret these transitions by analyzing transformer embeddings and attention maps. Overall, CoT-ICL Lab serves as a simple yet powerful testbed for theoretical and empirical insights into ICL and CoT in language models.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** KVLink offers a method for efficient reuse of key-value (KV) caches in large language models, enhancing speed and accuracy during inference by allowing the model to utilize precomputed caches.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address redundancy in computation when overlapping contexts are present in LLM applications, leading to inefficient resource usage.

**Method:** KVLink computes KV caches for documents independently and concatenates them during inference, introducing positional adjustments and special tokens for effective self-attention restoration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of KVLink for efficient KV cache reuse
	2. Positional embedding adjustments for concatenated caches
	3. Use of trainable special tokens for self-attention restoration

**Result:** KVLink enhances question answering accuracy by 4% and reduces time-to-first-token by 96% relative to traditional LLM inference methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** KVLink provides a scalable, efficient solution for leveraging cache reuse in LLMs and can be integrated with other cache compression techniques for improved performance.

**Abstract:** We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the importance of spatial reasoning and the Frame of Reference in AI, there is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and evaluations for LLMs in this context.

**Method:** The authors developed the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark to test LLM comprehension and layout generation related to FoR. They also introduced Spatial-Guided prompting to improve performance in spatial reasoning tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the FoREST benchmark for assessing FoR in LLMs
	2. Identification of performance gaps in LLMs related to FoR comprehension
	3. Proposal of Spatial-Guided prompting to enhance spatial reasoning tasks.

**Result:** LLMs exhibited significant performance gaps across different FoR classes, which affected their ability to generate correct layouts for text-to-image generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** To enhance FoR understanding, the proposed Spatial-Guided prompting improved LLMs' ability to grasp essential spatial concepts and overall performance in spatial reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts. Our proposed method improves overall performance across spatial reasoning tasks.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a framework for evaluating Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting in addressing multilingual reasoning challenges in large language models, showing that fine-tuning PoT significantly enhances reasoning and accuracy compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Enhancing multilingual performance in large language models where multi-step reasoning is required, specifically addressing the challenges of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in non-English languages.

**Method:** The paper introduces a framework that separates multilingual reasoning from code execution to evaluate PoT prompting, analyzing the effects of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and how reasoning quality influences answer correctness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a novel evaluation framework for PoT prompting.
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of PoT fine-tuning over CoT in multilingual contexts.
	3. Established a correlation between reasoning quality and answer accuracy.

**Result:** The findings reveal that PoT fine-tuning leads to significant improvements in multilingual reasoning capabilities and demonstrates a strong correlation between the quality of reasoning (as measured by code quality) and the accuracy of answers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results suggest that the PoT approach can serve as an effective technique to enhance reasoning quality and accuracy in multilingual applications of large language models.

**Abstract:** Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.

**Conclusion:** The study provides insights for improving LLM-MAS functionality and evaluation, with the resources available for public use.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 11 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaptation which are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. The environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and the evaluation package are publicly available at https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked.

**Motivation:** To address the training challenges in deep transformer models related to the positioning of layer normalization.

**Method:** HybridNorm uses QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network of transformer blocks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HybridNorm, a hybrid normalization method
	2. Empirical validation showing improved performance over Pre-Norm and Post-Norm
	3. Theoretical insights into gradient flow and model robustness

**Result:** HybridNorm improves gradient flow and model robustness, consistently outperforming both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm across multiple benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HybridNorm offers a more stable and effective technique for training deep transformers, enhancing their overall performance.

**Abstract:** Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence demonstrating that HybridNorm improves gradient flow and model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

**Motivation:** The increasing volume of academic publications necessitates automating the time-consuming process of paper reviews.

**Method:** The authors introduce a dataset called Review-CoT for training LLM agents, emulating human reviewers' reasoning processes, and develop the ReviewAgents framework for generating structured review comments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Review-CoT dataset with 142k review comments

**Result:** Experimental results show that ReviewAgents outperform existing LLMs in generating review comments, though gaps remain compared to human reviews.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The ReviewAgents framework effectively narrows the gap in review comment quality between LLM-generated and human-generated reviews.

**Abstract:** Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a method called uncertainty distillation to improve large language models' ability to verbalize calibrated semantic confidences that accurately reflect their error rates.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** As LLMs are used more for factual question-answering, it's crucial for them to communicate the likelihood of answer correctness, necessitating reliable uncertainty quantification methods.

**Method:** The proposed method, uncertainty distillation, uses held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to meaningful probabilities and involves creating annotated examples for supervised fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of uncertainty distillation for LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of improved correlation between verbalized confidence and error rates.
	3. Development of a framework for supervised fine-tuning with annotated probabilities.

**Result:** Uncertainty distillation leads to verbalized confidences from LLMs that strongly correlate with their observed error rates, outperforming several strong baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach significantly improves the reliability of how LLMs express their confidence, making their outputs more meaningful.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for factual question-answering, it becomes more important for LLMs to have the capability to communicate the likelihood that their answer is correct. For these verbalized expressions of uncertainty to be meaningful, they should reflect the error rates at the expressed level of confidence. However, when prompted to express confidence, the error rates of current LLMs are inconsistent with their communicated confidences, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification methods. Many prior methods calculate lexical uncertainty, estimating a model's confidence in the specific string it generated. In some cases, however, it may be more useful to estimate semantic uncertainty, or the model's confidence in the answer regardless of how it is verbalized. We propose a simple procedure, uncertainty distillation, to teach an LLM to verbalize calibrated semantic confidences. Using held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to meaningful probabilities, we create examples annotated with verbalized probabilities for supervised fine-tuning. We compare uncertainty distillation to several strong baselines, and find that our method yields verbalized confidences that correlate well with observed error rates.

**Motivation:** The paper motivates the need for personalized alignment of LLMs due to the diversity in user values and preferences that current one-size-fits-all methods overlook.

**Method:** A systematic preference space is established with persona representations for robust preference inference, leading to the development of two alignment approaches: in-context alignment and preference-bridged alignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a comprehensive framework for personalized alignment of LLMs
	2. Development of the AlignX dataset of over 1.3 million preference examples
	3. Introduction of two novel alignment approaches enhancing accuracy and adaptability.

**Result:** The proposed methods showed an average accuracy gain of 17.06% across four benchmarks, with effective adaptation to new preferences and robustness to limited user data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results support a shift towards user-adaptive AI systems that better address diverse user needs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally been aligned through one-size-fits-all approaches that assume uniform human preferences, fundamentally overlooking the diversity in user values and needs. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability. These results validate our approach toward user-adaptive AI systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a self-contained Socratic approach to measure LLM biases directly.
	2. Evaluated ideological preferences across two diverse datasets.
	3. Identified systematic biases in LLMs related to political and economic topics.

**Result:** The evaluation reveals a consistent preference for Democratic positions over Republican across all models and varying biases among Western LLMs in economic topics, with Chinese models leaning toward socialism.

**Limitations:** The study may not account for all cultural contexts influencing bias in LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the different ideological biases of LLMs in political and economic discourse, offering a method to assess these biases with reduced subjectivity.

**Abstract:** While detecting and avoiding bias in LLM-generated text is becoming increasingly important, media bias often remains subtle and subjective, making it particularly difficult to identify and mitigate. In this study, we assess media bias in LLM-generated content and LLMs' ability to detect subtle ideological bias. We conduct this evaluation using two datasets, PoliGen and EconoLex, covering political and economic discourse, respectively. We evaluate seven widely used LLMs by prompting them to generate articles and analyze their ideological preferences via Socratic probing. By using our self-contained Socratic approach, the study aims to directly measure the models' biases rather than relying on external interpretations, thereby minimizing subjective judgments about media bias. Our results reveal a consistent preference of Democratic over Republican positions across all models. Conversely, in economic topics, biases vary among Western LLMs, while those developed in China lean more strongly toward socialism.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The strong performance of Praxis-VLM underscores the potential for language-based reasoning to enhance the decision-making capabilities of VLMs, reducing the need for paired image-text data.

**Abstract:** Vision Language Models exhibited immense potential for embodied AI, yet they often lack the sophisticated situational reasoning required for complex decision-making. This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as text-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.

**Abstract:** Improving training efficiency continues to be one of the primary challenges in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate how context length and the complexity of training data influence the RL scaling training process of R1-distilled small reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) simply controlling the context length and curating the training data based on the input prompt length can effectively improve the training efficiency of scaling RL, achieving better performance with more concise CoT; (2) properly scaling the context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) choosing an optimal context length can improve the efficiency of model training and incentivize the model's chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum RL framework with stage-wise context scaling to achieve efficient training and concise CoT reasoning. Experiment results demonstrate that FastCuRL-1.5B-V3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on five competition-level benchmarks and achieves 49.6\% accuracy on AIME 2024. Furthermore, FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview on five benchmarks while only using a single node with 8 GPUs and a total of 50\% of training steps. %The code, training data, and models will be publicly released.

### [199] [Universal Cross-Tokenizer Distillation via Approximate Likelihood Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20083)

*Benjamin Minixhofer, Ivan Vulić, Edoardo Maria Ponti*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Tokenization, Distillation, Knowledge Transfer, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel cross-tokenizer distillation method for transferring knowledge between Large Language Models (LLMs) with different tokenizers, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods and improves performance across various use cases.

**Read time:** 21 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current distillation methods require similar tokenizers between teacher and student LLMs, limiting their applicability. This work aims to develop a method for effective distillation across different tokenizers.

**Method:** The proposed method enables effective distillation by treating tokenizer transfer as self-distillation, allowing models with different tokenizers to effectively transfer knowledge and improve interoperability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First effective method for distillation across different tokenizers
	2. Demonstrated substantial performance improvements in three distinct use cases
	3. Facilitated enhanced interaction between LLMs through expanded adapter models

**Result:** The method outperforms prior distillation techniques across various scenarios, including transferring subword models to byte-level, distilling a math-specialized LLM to a general-purpose model with different tokenizers, and enhancing embedding prediction hypernetworks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The novel cross-tokenizer distillation technique expands the range of compatible teacher-student pairs, facilitating new adaptations in LLM interactions and enhancing their overall performance.

**Abstract:** Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods require similar tokenizers between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a principled cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable effective distillation across fundamentally different tokenizers, while also substantially outperforming prior methods in all other cases. We verify the efficacy of our method on three distinct use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedentedly effective transfer across tokenizers, including rapid transfer of subword models to the byte-level. Transferring different models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling to boost performance. Secondly, we distil a large maths-specialised LLM into a small general-purpose model with a different tokenizer, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Thirdly, we use our method to train state-of-the-art embedding prediction hypernetworks for training-free tokenizer transfer. Our results unlock an expanded range of teacher-student pairs for distillation, enabling new ways to adapt and enhance interaction between LLMs.

**TL;DR:** TASTE introduces a novel approach for spoken language modeling by aligning speech tokens with text transcriptions, improving natural human-LLM interaction.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limited effectiveness of recent speech tokens in joint speech-text modeling for human-LLM interaction.

**Method:** Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE) utilizes an attention-based aggregation mechanism and speech reconstruction as the training objective to align speech tokens with text transcriptions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE) method.
	2. Achieves alignment of speech tokens and text transcriptions during tokenization.
	3. First end-to-end approach to use speech reconstruction as a training objective.

**Result:** TASTE-based spoken language models show comparable performance to existing methods on SALMON and StoryCloze, while significantly outperforming other pre-trained SLMs in speech continuation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TASTE is the first end-to-end method to automatically learn text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding, enhancing spoken language modeling.

**Abstract:** Recent efforts target spoken language models (SLMs) that not only listen but also speak for more natural human-LLM interaction. Joint speech-text modeling is a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent speech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE, we perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank Adaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that TASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze; while significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation across subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling. Our demo, code, and model are available at https://mtkresearch.github.io/TASTE-SpokenLM.github.io.

**Motivation:** Address the underrepresentation of low-resource languages in the development of large language models (LLMs).

**Method:** We used a curated dataset of 485K samples to instruction tune various models, achieving a 3% average benchmark improvement in multilingual performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Mantra-14B, a Hindi-English bilingual LLM.
	2. Significant multilingual performance improvement with smaller model size.
	3. Open release of training resources for further research.

**Result:** Mantra-14B outperforms larger models by improving performance in both English and Hindi without resource-intensive techniques.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Modest fine-tuning with localized data can enhance model performance for under-represented languages without significant computational costs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments - including evaluation on question answering and summarization tasks - show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks while requiring minimal annotated data and computational resources. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing sophistication of LLMs has made it challenging for existing systems to accurately detect machine-generated content, particularly in shorter texts and cases where human and machine contributions are mixed.

**Method:** The authors developed token classification models trained on a unique dataset of 2.4 million co-authored texts across 23 languages, focusing on performance in diverse domains and against adversarial inputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a token classification model for human-LLM co-authored texts
	2. A new dataset of 2.4 million texts co-authored by LLMs
	3. Evaluation metrics against adversarial inputs and text characteristics

**Result:** The models demonstrated strong performance in classifying co-authored texts, outperforming existing systems particularly in handling unseen domains, non-native speaker content, and adversarial conditions.

**Limitations:** Performance may vary with specific nuances of different languages and contexts not covered in the training data.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest significant advancements in detecting co-authored content, with robust performance metrics across various challenges, establishing a foundation for future research in AI content detection.

**Abstract:** An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces SMARTe, a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple Extraction, emphasizing interpretability without sacrificing performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Prior research on Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) has focused on model performance but lacks understanding of the internal mechanisms, leading to opaque systems.

**Method:** SMARTe utilizes a slot attention mechanism to consolidate relevant information into slots, framing the task as a set prediction problem.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SMARTe framework for RTE
	2. Implementation of a slot attention mechanism for interpretability
	3. Demonstration of performance on NYT and WebNLG datasets while ensuring explainability

**Result:** SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while enhancing interpretability, as demonstrated through evaluations on NYT and WebNLG datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adding interpretability to the model does not compromise performance, and qualitative assessments provide insightful explanations of predictions.

**Abstract:** Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations, we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark to evaluate LLM-judges' performance compared to traditional reward models in various computational tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the effectiveness of LLM-judges as evaluators in enhancing test-time computation for large language models, given the growing use of language-based evaluations in automatic assessment.

**Method:** The benchmark evaluates 10 different judge models across three domains (math reasoning, code generation, instruction following) and under three task settings (response reranking, step-level beam search, critique-based response refinement).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the JETTS benchmark for assessing LLM-judges
	2. Evaluation across multiple domains and task settings
	3. Comparative analysis of judge models against traditional reward models

**Result:** The study finds that while LLM-judges perform competitively with outcome reward models for response reranking, they underperform against process reward models in beam search tasks and provide ineffective critiques.

**Limitations:** LLM-judges show consistent shortcomings in guiding the generator's response improvement through critiques.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the current limitations of LLM-judges in guiding generator responses, suggesting a need for further refinement and research in this area.

**Abstract:** Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of training LLMs using Reinforcement Learning on unlabeled data without access to ground-truth information.

**Method:** The proposed TTRL method leverages Test-Time Scaling techniques like majority voting to estimate rewards and drive reinforcement learning training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) for LLMs on unlabeled data
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness of majority voting for reward estimation
	3. Achieved substantial performance improvements compared to existing models

**Result:** TTRL significantly improves performance on various tasks, boosting pass@1 performance by approximately 211% on specific benchmarks while surpassing initial model performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The experiments validate TTRL's effectiveness and highlight its potential applicability across diverse tasks and domains, even with minimal supervision.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL
