<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the availability and quality of mobile health applications that assist caregivers of children with ASD facing feeding challenges.

**Method:** A systematic review was conducted of mobile applications available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store using predefined search terms. Only apps that were in English, free, updated recently, specifically addressed feeding issues in ASD, accessible in Africa, and had more than 100 downloads were included.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critical evaluation of mHealth apps for ASD-related feeding difficulties
	2. Identification of major gaps in app availability and quality
	3. Insights into usability and functionality of existing applications

**Result:** Out of 326 identified apps, only two iOS applications met all inclusion criteria, while no Android apps qualified. The selected apps incorporated various intervention functions according to the Behavior Change Wheel but lacked comprehensive behavioral strategies.

**Limitations:** The study only included apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play, limiting the comprehensiveness of the review.

**Conclusion:** The review reveals a significant gap in high-quality, evidence-based mHealth tools for supporting caregivers dealing with ASD-related feeding difficulties, indicating a need for better-designed applications.

**Abstract:** Approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and 46% to 89% experience significant feeding difficulties. Although mobile health (mHealth) applications offer potential support for caregivers, the quality and relevance of apps targeting autism-related feeding issues remain unclear. This systematic review evaluated mobile applications available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store between September and October 2024. The searches were carried out using 15 predefined terms (e.g., "child autism feeding", "child autism food"). Applications were eligible if they were in English, free to download, updated within the past year, explicitly addressed feeding in children with autism, accessible in Africa, and had more than 100 downloads. Of the 326 apps identified, only two iOS applications met all inclusion criteria; no Android apps qualified. Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) analysis showed that the selected applications incorporated multiple intervention functions, such as education, training, enablement, incentivization, and modeling, though none addressed the full spectrum of behavioral strategies. Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) indicated moderate to high usability, with features such as sensory-friendly food routines and structured caregiver tools. However, both apps lacked clinical validation and comprehensive customization. These findings highlight a critical gap in the availability of evidence-based high-quality mHealth tools for caregivers managing ASD-related feeding challenges and underscore the need for professionally developed and culturally sensitive digital solutions.

### [2] [Passing the Buck to AI: How Individuals' Decision-Making Patterns Affect Reliance on AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01537)

*Katelyn Xiaoying Mei, Rock Yuren Pang, Alex Lyford, Lucy Lu Wang, Katharina Reinecke*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** decision-making, AI reliance, psychological patterns, human-computer interaction, food myths

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** Study examines how decision-making patterns affect reliance on AI in food fact-checking.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how decision-making styles influence AI adoption and reliance.

**Method:** Conducted an online experiment with 810 participants distinguishing food facts from myths.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified correlations between decision-making patterns and AI reliance.
	2. Provided insights into individual differences in AI-assisted decision-making.
	3. Highlighted the role of vigilance and buckpassing in how people engage with AI.

**Result:** Found that higher buckpassing tendency correlates with more reliance on AI, while vigilance leads to more scrutiny of AI information.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Decision-making patterns significantly influence individual reliance on AI, revealing differences in AI-assisted decision-making.

**Abstract:** Psychological research has identified different patterns individuals have while making decisions, such as vigilance (making decisions after thorough information gathering), hypervigilance (rushed and anxious decision-making), and buckpassing (deferring decisions to others). We examine whether these decision-making patterns shape peoples' likelihood of seeking out or relying on AI. In an online experiment with 810 participants tasked with distinguishing food facts from myths, we found that a higher buckpassing tendency was positively correlated with both seeking out and relying on AI suggestions, while being negatively correlated with the time spent reading AI explanations. In contrast, the higher a participant tended towards vigilance, the more carefully they scrutinized the AI's information, as indicated by an increased time spent looking through the AI's explanations. These findings suggest that a person's decision-making pattern plays a significant role in their adoption and reliance on AI, which provides a new understanding of individual differences in AI-assisted decision-making.

**Abstract:** Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) are widely used across diverse creative domains, with generative AI recently increasing the abilities of CSTs. To better understand how the success of CSTs is determined in the literature, we conducted a review of outcome measures used in CST evaluations. Drawing from (n=173) CST evaluations in the ACM Digital Library, we identified the metrics commonly employed to assess user interactions with CSTs. Our findings reveal prevailing trends in current evaluation practices, while exposing underexplored measures that could broaden the scope of future research. Based on these results, we argue for a more holistic approach to evaluating CSTs, encouraging the HCI community to consider not only user experience and the quality of the generated output, but also user-centric aspects such as self-reflection and well-being as critical dimensions of assessment. We also highlight a need for validated measures specifically suited to the evaluation of generative AI in CSTs.

**TL;DR:** The paper discusses effective human-AI interaction strategies in question answering, comparing two configurations: Nudging and Highlight, against traditional human-only methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance collaborative efficiency in human-AI interactions, particularly in question-answering scenarios.

**Method:** Two controlled experiments were conducted—one with 31 participants and another with 106 participants—to compare the Nudging and Highlight configurations with traditional human-only approaches.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Nudging and Highlight configurations for AI prompt guidance
	2. Insights into improving human-AI collaboration in question answering
	3. Empirical evidence from controlled experiments on interaction dynamics

**Result:** The Nudging configuration improved response quality compared to AI alone, highlighting the importance of effective human-AI collaboration.

**Limitations:** Limited participant diversity and scope; results may vary in different contexts or with different AI systems.

**Conclusion:** While combining human and AI efforts can enhance output quality, it does not guarantee better results without effective guidance strategies.

**Abstract:** Understanding the dynamics of human-AI interaction in question answering is crucial for enhancing collaborative efficiency. Extending from our initial formative study, which revealed challenges in human utilization of conversational AI support, we designed two configurations for prompt guidance: a Nudging approach, where the AI suggests potential responses for human agents, and a Highlight strategy, emphasizing crucial parts of reference documents to aid human responses. Through two controlled experiments, the first involving 31 participants and the second involving 106 participants, we compared these configurations against traditional human-only approaches, both with and without AI assistance. Our findings suggest that effective human-AI collaboration can enhance response quality, though merely combining human and AI efforts does not ensure improved outcomes. In particular, the Nudging configuration was shown to help improve the quality of the output when compared to AI alone. This paper delves into the development of these prompt guidance paradigms, offering insights for refining human-AI collaborations in conversational question-answering contexts and contributing to a broader understanding of human perceptions and expectations in AI partnerships.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents AISA, an AI-based speaking assistant for non-native speakers, and evaluates its impact on their speaking abilities during multilingual communication through a mixed-method study.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges faced by non-native speakers in real-time multilingual communication and improve their speaking abilities.

**Method:** A mixed-method study involving a within-subject experiment with 31 teams consisting of two native speakers and one non-native speaker. Teams completed tasks with and without access to the AISA, followed by interviews.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an AI-based speaking assistant for NNSs
	2. Mixed-method approach to evaluate effectiveness
	3. Insights into the interaction patterns and experiences of NNSs with AISA

**Result:** The study identified four types of AISA input patterns among non-native speakers, which indicated varying levels of effort and language preferences. While AISA did not enhance speaking competence, it improved the logical flow and depth of speech. However, it also increased workload and anxiety for users.

**Limitations:** AISA did not improve overall speaking competence and may elevate workload and anxiety among users.

**Conclusion:** The pros and cons of using tools like AISA in real-time communication are discussed, along with design recommendations for better assisting non-native speakers.

**Abstract:** Non-native speakers (NNSs) often face speaking challenges in real-time multilingual communication, such as struggling to articulate their thoughts. To address this issue, we developed an AI-based speaking assistant (AISA) that provides speaking references for NNSs based on their input queries, task background, and conversation history. To explore NNSs' interaction with AISA and its impact on NNSs' speaking during real-time multilingual communication, we conducted a mixed-method study involving a within-subject experiment and follow-up interviews. In the experiment, two native speakers (NSs) and one NNS formed a team (31 teams in total) and completed two collaborative tasks--one with access to the AISA and one without. Overall, our study revealed four types of AISA input patterns among NNSs, each reflecting different levels of effort and language preferences. Although AISA did not improve NNSs' speaking competence, follow-up interviews revealed that it helped improve the logical flow and depth of their speech. Moreover, the additional multitasking introduced by AISA, such as entering and reviewing system output, potentially elevated NNSs' workload and anxiety. Based on these observations, we discuss the pros and cons of implementing tools to assist NNS in real-time multilingual communication and offer design recommendations.

**Result:** Contrary to assumptions, paper-based input methods were found to outperform digital methods in accuracy and efficiency under specific conditions. Additionally, speech-based systems faced issues with pilot trust, leading to the recommendation of hybrid solutions.

**Limitations:** The study primarily relies on a simulated environment, which may not fully capture real-world complexities of airport layouts and operations.

**Conclusion:** Future pilot-centered taxiway assistance tools need to enhance situational awareness, reduce workload, and improve safety by addressing the limitations of current automation strategies.

**Abstract:** Runway and taxiway incursions continue to challenge aviation safety, as pilots often experience disorientation from poor visibility in adverse conditions and cognitive workload in complex airport layouts. Current tools, such as airport moving maps on portable tablets, allow manual route planning but do not dynamically adapt to air traffic controllers' (ATCOs) clearances, limiting their effectiveness in high-stress scenarios. This study investigates the impact of different input modalities - paper-based, keyboard touch, map touch, and speech-to-text - on taxiway navigation performance, using a medium-fidelity flight simulator and a Wizard-of-Oz methodology to simulate ideal automation conditions. Contrary to common assumptions, recent studies indicate that paper-based methods outperform digital counterparts in accuracy and efficiency under certain conditions, highlighting critical limitations in current automation strategies. In response, our study investigates why manual methods may excel and how future automation can be optimized for pilot-centered operations. Employing a Wizard-of-Oz approach, we replicated the full taxiing process - from receiving ATCO clearances to executing maneuvers - and differentiated between readback and execution accuracy. Findings reveal that speech-based systems suffer from low pilot trust, necessitating hybrid solutions that integrate error correction and confidence indicators. These insights contribute to the development of future pilot-centered taxiway assistance that enhance situational awareness, minimize workload, and improve overall operational safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance understanding of real-world user behavior in educational video interaction, focusing on the understudied aspect of visual complexity.

**Method:** The authors propose a fine-grained taxonomy of visual objects in educational videos and apply it to analyze user interactions with 25 videos from physics and chemistry.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel taxonomy of visual objects in educational videos.
	2. Demonstrated the correlation between visual complexity and user interactions.
	3. Provided implications for optimizing educational video design in STEM fields.

**Result:** The analysis reveals that increased visual complexity, particularly of textual elements, correlates with more pauses, rewinds, and session dropouts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** These findings provide insights into how video design impacts user behavior in educational contexts, highlighting the need for optimized design in STEM educational materials.

**Abstract:** Educational videos have become increasingly relevant in today's learning environments. While prior research in laboratory studies has provided valuable insights, analyzing real-world interaction data can enhance our understanding of authentic user behavior. Previous studies have investigated technical aspects, such as the influence of cuts on pausing behavior, but the impact of visual complexity remains understudied. In this paper, we address this gap and propose a novel approach centered on visual complexity, defined as the number of visually distinguishable and meaningful elements in a video frame, such as mathematical equations, chemical formulas, or graphical representations. Our study introduces a fine-grained taxonomy of visual objects in educational videos, expanding on previous classifications. Applying this taxonomy to 25 videos from physics and chemistry, we examine the relationship between visual complexity and user behavior, including pauses, in-video navigation, and session dropouts. The results indicate that increased visual complexity, especially of textual elements, correlates with more frequent pauses, rewinds, and dropouts. The results offer a deeper understanding of how video design affects user behavior in real-world scenarios. Our work has implications for optimizing educational videos, particularly in STEM fields. We make our code publicly available (https://github.com/TIBHannover/from_formulas_to_figures).

We present FlowTrainer, an LLM-assisted interactive system to allow educators to author lesson plans for their iVR instruction based on desired goals. The authoring workflow is supported by Backward design to align the planned lesson based on the desired outcomes. We implemented a welding use case and conducted a user study with welding experts to test the effectiveness of the system in authoring outcome-oriented lesson plans. The study results showed that the system allowed users to plan lesson plans based on desired outcomes while reducing the time and technical expertise required for the authoring process. We believe that such efforts can allow widespread adoption of iVR solutions in manufacturing training to meet the workforce demands in the industry.

### [12] [Can LLM-Simulated Practice and Feedback Upskill Human Counselors? A Randomized Study with 90+ Novice Counselors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02428)

*Ryan Louie, Ifdita Hasan Orney, Juan Pablo Pacheco, Raj Sanjay Shah, Emma Brunskill, Diyi Yang*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, counseling training, AI feedback, skill development, mental health

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the effectiveness of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based training system, CARE, in improving novice counselors' skills through simulated practice and structured feedback.

**Read time:** 33 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the demand for accessible mental health support by leveraging LLMs to enhance counseling skills training, which is typically resource-intensive and challenging to scale.

**Method:** A randomized study involving 94 novice counselors who practiced with an AI patient, either receiving AI feedback or practicing alone, to assess behavioral performance and self-assessments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CARE system for LLM-based counseling training
	2. Demonstration of the importance of structured feedback in skill development
	3. Empirical evidence showing differential impacts on counselor skills based on training conditions.

**Result:** Counselors who practiced with AI feedback significantly improved their skills, particularly in reflections and questions, while those practicing alone showed no improvement in skills and a decline in empathy.

**Limitations:** Limited sample size and context-specific results may impact generalizability.

**Conclusion:** LLM-based training systems can effectively foster skill development in counseling when both practice and feedback are combined.

**Abstract:** Training more counselors, from clinical students to peer supporters, can help meet the demand for accessible mental health support; however, current training approaches remain resource-intensive and difficult to scale effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for growing counseling skills training through simulated practice and automated feedback. Despite successes in aligning LLMs with expert-counselor annotations, we do not know whether LLM-based counseling training tools -- such as AI patients that simulate real-world challenges and generative AI feedback with suggested alternatives and rationales -- actually lead to improvements in novice counselor skill development. We develop CARE, an LLM-simulated practice and feedback system, and randomize 94 novice counselors to practice using an AI patient, either alone or with AI feedback, measuring changes in their behavioral performance, self-assessments, and qualitative learning takeaways. Our results show the practice-and-feedback group improved in their use of reflections and questions (d=0.32-0.39, p$<$0.05). In contrast, the group that practiced with an AI patient alone did not show improvements, and in the case of empathy, actually had worse uses across time (d=$-$0.52, p=0.001) and when compared against the practice-and-feedback group (d=0.72, p=0.001). Participants' qualitative self-reflections revealed key differences: the practice-and-feedback group adopted a client-centered approach involving listening to and validating feelings, while the practice-alone group remained solution-oriented but delayed offering suggestions until gathering more information. Overall, these results suggest that LLM-based training systems can promote effective skill development, but that combining both simulated practice and structured feedback is critical.

**Conclusion:** Human-AI collaborative processes should be designed to safeguard and enhance culinary ICH while addressing challenges in accuracy and flavor preservation.

**Abstract:** Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) like traditional culinary practices face increasing pressure to adapt to globalization while maintaining their cultural authenticity. Centuries-old traditions in Chinese cuisine are subject to rapid changes for adaptation to contemporary tastes and dietary preferences. The preservation of these cultural practices requires approaches that can enable ICH practitioners to reimagine and recreate ICH for modern contexts. To address this, we created workshops where experienced practitioners of traditional Chinese cuisine co-created recipes using GenAI tools and realized the dishes. We found that GenAI inspired ICH practitioners to innovate recipes based on traditional workflows for broader audiences and adapt to modern dining contexts. However, GenAI-inspired co-creation posed challenges in maintaining the accuracy of original ICH workflows and preserving traditional flavors in the culinary outcomes. This study offers implications for designing human-AI collaborative processes for safeguarding and enhancing culinary ICH.

**TL;DR:** This study defends the relevance of the Turing Test in evaluating AI by proposing refined versions that enhance interaction quality and differentiation between AI and human responses.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the criticisms of the Turing Test and demonstrate that it can still effectively assess intelligence in AI, particularly in the context of rapid advancements in AI technologies.

**Method:** Systematic experimentation using a web-based platform, allowing for simultaneous interactions with both AI and human candidates, and varying the conditions to enhance evaluative accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes refinements to the Turing Test for better evaluation of AI.
	2. Demonstrates the effectiveness of structured interaction environments in distinguishing AI from humans.
	3. Provides insights into human expectations of intelligent AI through experimental data.

**Result:** The study reveals that, while some versions of the Turing Test can be passed by an LLM, more robustly designed versions can reveal the limitations of AI in mimicking human interaction.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Turing Test is still a viable benchmark for evaluating AI, but it needs to evolve along with AI advancements to remain effective.

**Abstract:** The Turing Test, first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, has historically served as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI). However, since the release of ELIZA in 1966, and particularly with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), AI has been claimed to pass the Turing Test. Furthermore, criticism argues that the Turing Test primarily assesses deceptive mimicry rather than genuine intelligence, prompting the continuous emergence of alternative benchmarks. This study argues against discarding the Turing Test, proposing instead using more refined versions of it, for example, by interacting simultaneously with both an AI and human candidate to determine who is who, allowing a longer interaction duration, access to the Internet and other AIs, using experienced people as evaluators, etc.   Through systematic experimentation using a web-based platform, we demonstrate that richer, contextually structured testing environments significantly enhance participants' ability to differentiate between AI and human interactions. Namely, we show that, while an off-the-shelf LLM can pass some version of a Turing Test, it fails to do so when faced with a more robust version. Our findings highlight that the Turing Test remains an important and effective method for evaluating AI, provided it continues to adapt as AI technology advances. Additionally, the structured data gathered from these improved interactions provides valuable insights into what humans expect from truly intelligent AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve multi-role interactions in pedagogical agents for a better learning experience in history education.

**Method:** A VR prototype was developed featuring adaptive role-switching and action-switching, evaluated through a 2 x 2 between-subjects study with 84 participants.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a VR prototype with adaptive pedagogical agents
	2. Insights on the impact of adaptive role and action switching on learning
	3. Design implications for future educational tools using adaptive interactions

**Result:** Adaptive role-switching improved perceptions of trustworthiness and expertise, while adaptive action-switching enhanced social presence and perceived humanness, but no effects were observed on usability or cognitive load.

**Limitations:** Inconsistent learning experiences with role-switching; no effects on usability and cognitive load were found.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest design implications for integrating adaptive interactions in VR history education tools, aiming to enhance educational outcomes.

**Abstract:** Multi-role pedagogical agents can create engaging and immersive learning experiences, helping learners better understand knowledge in history learning. However, existing pedagogical agents often struggle with multi-role interactions due to complex controls, limited feedback forms, and difficulty dynamically adapting to user inputs. In this study, we developed a VR prototype with LLM-powered adaptive role-switching and action-switching pedagogical agents to help users learn about the history of the Pavilion of Prince Teng. A 2 x 2 between-subjects study was conducted with 84 participants to assess how adaptive role-switching and action-switching affect participants' learning outcomes and experiences. The results suggest that adaptive role-switching enhances participants' perception of the pedagogical agent's trustworthiness and expertise but may lead to inconsistent learning experiences. Adaptive action-switching increases participants' perceived social presence, expertise, and humanness. The study did not uncover any effects of role-switching and action-switching on usability, learning motivation, and cognitive load. Based on the findings, we proposed five design implications for incorporating adaptive role-switching and action-switching into future VR history education tools.

	3. Improvement of diagnostic workflows through natural gesture interaction

**Result:** The platform enables pathologists to view multiple cases side-by-side for comparison, improving diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency while reducing cognitive fatigue.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PathVis enhances the practice of pathology by integrating advanced visualization techniques and AI, making the diagnostic process more effective and reducing strain on pathologists.

**Abstract:** Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis

**Conclusion:** LLMs can advance smart home technologies and encourage sustainable living, warranting further research to enhance their application in real-world contexts.

**Abstract:** To combat climate change, individuals are encouraged to adopt sustainable habits, in particular, with their household, optimizing their electrical consumption. Conversational agents, such as Smart Home Assistants, hold promise as effective tools for promoting sustainable practices within households. Our research investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLM) in enhancing smart home automation and promoting sustainable household practices, specifically using the HomeAssistant framework. In particular, it highlights the potential of GPT models in generating accurate automation routines. While the LLMs showed proficiency in understanding complex commands and creating valid JSON outputs, challenges such as syntax errors and message malformations were noted, indicating areas for further improvement. Still, despite minimal quantitative differences between "green" and "no green" prompts, qualitative feedback highlighted a positive shift towards sustainability in the routines generated with environmentally focused prompts. Then, an empirical evaluation (N=56) demonstrated that the system was well-received and found engaging by users compared to its traditional rule-based counterpart. Our findings highlight the role of LLMs in advancing smart home technologies and suggest further research to refine these models for broader, real-world applications to support sustainable living.

**TL;DR:** HappyRouting is a navigation system designed to enhance drivers' emotional well-being by providing routes that evoke positive emotions, evaluated in a real-world driving study.

**Read time:** 17 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current navigation systems focus on speed and efficiency but neglect the emotional well-being of drivers.

**Method:** Development of an emotion map layer using machine learning to predict emotions based on contextual data, combined with a routing optimization framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the HappyRouting system that prioritizes emotional well-being in navigation
	2. Development of a machine learning model to predict emotions along routes
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness of happy routing in real-world evaluation.

**Result:** The study showed that 'happy' routes increased subjective emotional valence by 11%, despite taking longer to drive.

**Limitations:** The study had a small sample size (N=13) and focused only on subjective measures of emotion.

**Conclusion:** Emotion-based routing offers a valuable alternative to traditional navigation methods by enhancing the emotional experience during travel.

**Abstract:** Routes represent an integral part of triggering emotions in drivers. Navigation systems allow users to choose a navigation strategy, such as the fastest or shortest route. However, they do not consider the driver's emotional well-being. We present HappyRouting, a novel navigation-based empathic car interface guiding drivers through real-world traffic while evoking positive emotions. We propose design considerations, derive a technical architecture, and implement a routing optimization framework. Our contribution is a machine learning-based generated emotion map layer, predicting emotions along routes based on static and dynamic contextual data. We evaluated HappyRouting in a real-world driving study (N=13), finding that happy routes increase subjectively perceived valence by 11% (p=.007). Although happy routes take 1.25 times longer on average, participants perceived the happy route as shorter, presenting an emotion-enhanced alternative to today's fastest routing mechanisms. We discuss how emotion-based routing can be integrated into navigation apps, promoting emotional well-being for mobility use.

**Result:** Experiments across 13 BCI paradigms validate the effectiveness and efficiency of Euclidean Alignment in improving EEG signal decoding.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper suggests potential new research directions for BCI researchers focused on EEG signal decoding.

**Abstract:** Due to large intra-subject and inter-subject variabilities of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/sessions, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 13 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.

**TL;DR:** Integrating LLM-based agents into self-guided career exploration exercises enhances engagement but has comparable overall benefits to traditional methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Young adults face challenges in career exploration and self-guided interventions can support their development, yet broader adoption lacks structured guidance.

**Method:** A one-week experiment involving N=36 participants compared three scenarios: manual letter writing, LLM-generated letters, and LLM chat interactions simulating future selves.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of LLM-based agents into a career exploration exercise
	2. Empirical evaluation of engagement levels across different conditions
	3. Design implications for AI-augmented interventions in career support

**Result:** Engagement increased when interacting with future-self agents, while overall benefits to future orientation and career self-concept were similar across all conditions.

**Limitations:** The study's sample size was relatively small (N=36) and may not represent broader populations.

**Conclusion:** AI-augmented interventions can enhance engagement in career exploration activities for young adults, indicating potential for broader application.

**Abstract:** Young adults often encounter challenges in career exploration. Self-guided interventions, such as the letter-exchange exercise, where participants envision and adopt the perspective of their future selves by exchanging letters with their envisioned future selves, can support career development. However, the broader adoption of such interventions may be limited without structured guidance. To address this, we integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that simulate participants' future selves into the letter-exchange exercise and evaluated their effectiveness. A one-week experiment (N=36) compared three conditions: (1) participants manually writing replies to themselves from the perspective of their future selves (baseline), (2) future-self agents generating letters to participants, and (3) future-self agents engaging in chat conversations with participants. Results indicated that exchanging letters with future-self agents enhanced participants' engagement during the exercise, while overall benefits of the intervention on future orientation, career self-concept, and psychological support remained comparable across conditions. We discuss design implications for AI-augmented interventions for supporting young adults' career exploration.

**Motivation:** To investigate the engagement of queer individuals with generative AI and identify supportive uses for this community, addressing a gap in existing research.

**Method:** Conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists, providing access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitating group activities for sensemaking.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Insights into the interaction between queer artists and generative AI technologies
	2. Identification of normative biases in AI models and their impact on user experience
	3. Development of strategies by queer users to overcome AI limitations

**Result:** Participants faced challenges due to normative values in the AI models but developed strategies to navigate these limitations, finding value in the technologies despite their biases.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by its small sample size and focus on artists, potentially limiting generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the necessity of considering queer perspectives in AI design and urges FAccT researchers to support queer alternatives in technology.

**Abstract:** Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people, have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists, during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how, nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT researchers might support queer alternatives.

**Result:** The proposed approach helps in determining the optimal number of human take-overs necessary to maintain safety and effectiveness without undermining the agent's utility.

**Limitations:** The proposed method may require additional validation in diverse real-world settings beyond the initial scope.

**Conclusion:** The findings support an approach that enhances both human confidence in agents and the overall safety of human-machine interactions through careful management of interventions.

**Abstract:** Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses a neuroadaptive haptics system that uses reinforcement learning and EEG signals to personalize feedback in XR environments.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance extended reality experiences by adapting multisensory feedback according to user preferences using neuroadaptive techniques.

**Method:** A neuroadaptive haptics system was tested in a user study where participants used VR and their EEG data were recorded while interacting with virtual objects.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a neuroadaptive haptics system for XR environments
	2. Integration of EEG-based feedback with reinforcement learning for user interaction
	3. Demonstration of effective personalized haptic feedback without active user input

**Result:** The reinforcement learning agent effectively adjusted haptic feedback based on both explicit user ratings and neural signals, with a comparable performance across these sources.

**Limitations:** The study's scope is limited to VR environments and may not generalize to all XR settings.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential for using brain-computer interfaces in combination with reinforcement learning to improve personalization and immersion in XR experiences.

**Abstract:** Neuroadaptive haptics offers a path to more immersive extended reality (XR) experiences by dynamically tuning multisensory feedback to user preferences. We present a neuroadaptive haptics system that adapts XR feedback through reinforcement learning (RL) from explicit user ratings and brain-decoded neural signals. In a user study, participants interacted with virtual objects in VR while Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. An RL agent adjusted haptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural decoder. Results show that the RL agent's performance was comparable across feedback sources, suggesting that implicit neural feedback can effectively guide personalization without requiring active user input. The EEG-based neural decoder achieved a mean F1 score of 0.8, supporting reliable classification of user experience. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and RL to autonomously adapt XR interactions, reducing cognitive load and enhancing immersion.

### [29] [Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and Attack-Defense Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01456)

*Vaidehi Patil, Yi-Lin Sung, Peter Hase, Jie Peng, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal unlearning, large language models, sensitive information, unlearning benchmark, visual question answering

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces UnLOK-VQA, a benchmark for assessing multimodal unlearning in large language models (MLLMs) by evaluating their ability to forget sensitive information in multimodal contexts.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the increasing use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that incorporate both text and images, the risk of these models retaining sensitive information has become a pressing concern. The paper addresses the gap in multimodal unlearning research.

**Method:** The authors propose a multimodal unlearning benchmark called UnLOK-VQA and develop an attack-and-defense framework to test the ability of MLLMs to unlearn specific multimodal knowledge. They create an extended visual question-answering dataset and evaluate six defense strategies against seven multimodal attack types.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the UnLOK-VQA benchmark for multimodal unlearning
	2. Development of an attack-and-defense framework for evaluating MLLMs
	3. Demonstration that larger MLLMs provide better robustness against information leakage

**Result:** The study finds that multimodal attacks are more effective than attacks focused solely on text or images, and the most successful defense strategy involves removing answer information from internal states of the model. Moreover, larger models show enhanced robustness in forgetting sensitive information.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** UnLOK-VQA serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in multimodal unlearning, indicating that model scale can contribute to improved safety against sensitive information leakage.

**Abstract:** LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning) necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs. While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally, larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing unlearning in MLLMs.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a persistent challenge in obtaining coherent and multi-step action sequences from language models, particularly in domains constrained by external factors.

**Method:** SymPlanner interfaces language models with a symbolic environment that provides a structured planning approach, using Iterative Correction (IC) for action refinement and Contrastive Ranking (CR) for plan evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SymPlanner framework for structured planning in LMs
	2. Implementation of Iterative Correction for refining actions
	3. Contrastive Ranking for evaluating plans

**Result:** SymPlanner generates coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans that outperform traditional natural language-based methods on the PlanBench evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of a symbolic environment improves the efficacy of language models in generating action plans, making them more robust and reliable.

**Abstract:** Planning remains a core challenge for language models (LMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how well large language models perform in the mechanical engineering domain using domain-specific data.

**Method:** Two unsupervised tasks were developed: a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task, using the ABC dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of language models in a specific domain (mechanical engineering)
	2. Development of unsupervised classification tasks for model evaluation
	3. Analysis of failure modes in domain-specific language learning.

**Result:** Achieved 0.62 accuracy on the binary sentence-pair classification task and 0.386 top-1 accuracy on the zero-shot classification task, outperforming baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into the performance and specific failure modes of language models in mechanical engineering applications.

**Abstract:** In this work, we seek to understand the performance of large language models in the mechanical engineering domain. We leverage the semantic data found in the ABC dataset, specifically the assembly names that designers assigned to the overall assemblies, and the individual semantic part names that were assigned to each part. After pre-processing the data we developed two unsupervised tasks to evaluate how different model architectures perform on domain-specific data: a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task. We achieved a 0.62 accuracy for the binary sentence-pair classification task with a fine-tuned model that focuses on fighting over-fitting: 1) modifying learning rates, 2) dropout values, 3) Sequence Length, and 4) adding a multi-head attention layer. Our model on the zero-shot classification task outperforms the baselines by a wide margin, and achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 0.386. The results shed some light on the specific failure modes that arise when learning from language in this domain.

*Vicent Briva Iglesias, Gokhan Dogru*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** machine translation, large language models, multi-agent systems, neural machine translation, evaluation metrics

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper benchmarks the performance of multi-agent orchestration and large language models (LLMs) against conventional neural machine translation (NMT), revealing that while qualitative gains exist, they come at much higher costs in terms of token usage.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To clarify the benefits of LLMs and multi-agent orchestration in machine translation compared to traditional neural machine translation systems.

**Method:** Five paradigms were benchmarked: Google Translate (NMT), GPT-4o (LLM), o1-preview (reasoning-enhanced LLM), and two GPT-4o-powered workflows, using both automatic and human evaluations on multilingual test data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical benchmark of LLMs and multi-agent workflows against NMT
	2. Identification of qualitative advantages of reasoning-enhanced translation
	3. Advocacy for cost-aware evaluation protocols

**Result:** The mature NMT system outperformed in automatic measures, while o1-preview excelled in human assessments for adequacy and fluency in several comparisons. However, multi-agent workflows had significantly higher token consumption costs.

**Limitations:** High costs in token usage for multi-agent workflows may limit practicality despite qualitative improvements.

**Conclusion:** A multidimensional, cost-aware evaluation approach is necessary, and future research should explore more efficient coordination strategies and hybrid systems.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent orchestration are touted as the next leap in machine translation (MT), but their benefits relative to conventional neural MT (NMT) remain unclear. This paper offers an empirical reality check. We benchmark five paradigms, Google Translate (strong NMT baseline), GPT-4o (general-purpose LLM), o1-preview (reasoning-enhanced LLM), and two GPT-4o-powered agentic workflows (sequential three-stage and iterative refinement), on test data drawn from a legal contract and news prose in three English-source pairs: Spanish, Catalan and Turkish. Automatic evaluation is performed with COMET, BLEU, chrF2 and TER; human evaluation is conducted with expert ratings of adequacy and fluency; efficiency with total input-plus-output token counts mapped to April 2025 pricing.   Automatic scores still favour the mature NMT system, which ranks first in seven of twelve metric-language combinations; o1-preview ties or places second in most remaining cases, while both multi-agent workflows trail. Human evaluation reverses part of this narrative: o1-preview produces the most adequate and fluent output in five of six comparisons, and the iterative agent edges ahead once, indicating that reasoning layers capture semantic nuance undervalued by surface metrics. Yet these qualitative gains carry steep costs. The sequential agent consumes roughly five times, and the iterative agent fifteen times, the tokens used by NMT or single-pass LLMs.   We advocate multidimensional, cost-aware evaluation protocols and highlight research directions that could tip the balance: leaner coordination strategies, selective agent activation, and hybrid pipelines combining single-pass LLMs with targeted agent intervention.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces PIPA, an evaluation protocol for task planning agents based on user satisfaction and agent behavior within a POMDP framework.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing benchmarks for agent performance focus on task completion, which may not reflect user satisfaction during the interactive process.

**Method:** The proposed PIPA protocol conceptualizes the evaluation of task planning agents through a partially observable Markov Decision Process framework, using atomic criteria to assess decision-making processes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the PIPA evaluation protocol
	2. Assessment criteria focused on user satisfaction
	3. Insights into agent behavior influencing user experience

**Result:** Agents demonstrate varying performance across different behavioral stages, where both outcomes and intermediate behaviors influence user satisfaction.

**Limitations:** The study highlights limitations of current user simulators in effectively evaluating task planning agents.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the need for a more holistic evaluation of interactive task planning agents and suggests future improvements in multi-agent systems and user simulator limitations.

**Abstract:** The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To address this gap, we propose PIPA, a unified evaluation protocol that conceptualizes the behavioral process of interactive task planning agents within a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) paradigm. The proposed protocol offers a comprehensive assessment of agent performance through a set of atomic evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the limitations of existing LLMs in estimating probabilities accurately in uncertain contexts, as traditional models yield coarse and biased predictions.

**Method:** The authors developed models through a combination of human and synthetic data, scaling them to larger model sizes and improving supervision techniques for better probability estimation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel approach to fine-grained probability estimation in LLMs
	2. Systematic evaluation demonstrating substantial performance improvements
	3. Better handling of uncertainty in model predictions

**Result:** The proposed models significantly outperform current fine-tuned and prompting-based methods across various tasks requiring conditional probability estimation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach provides strong, precise models for probability estimates under uncertainty, enhancing the application of LLMs in domains where accurate probabilistic reasoning is crucial.

**Abstract:** We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and prompting-based methods by a large margin.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines.

**Conclusion:** The study showcases a method to effectively leverage LLMs for medical text processing, addressing annotation challenges and enhancing performance with efficient training strategies.

**Abstract:** Automated labeling of chest X-ray reports is essential for enabling downstream tasks such as training image-based diagnostic models, population health studies, and clinical decision support. However, the high variability, complexity, and prevalence of negation and uncertainty in these free-text reports pose significant challenges for traditional Natural Language Processing methods. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text understanding, their direct application for large-scale, efficient labeling is limited by computational cost and speed. This paper introduces DeBERTa-RAD, a novel two-stage framework that combines the power of state-of-the-art LLM pseudo-labeling with efficient DeBERTa-based knowledge distillation for accurate and fast chest X-ray report labeling. We leverage an advanced LLM to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, including certainty statuses, for a large corpus of reports. Subsequently, a DeBERTa-Base model is trained on this pseudo-labeled data using a tailored knowledge distillation strategy. Evaluated on the expert-annotated MIMIC-500 benchmark, DeBERTa-RAD achieves a state-of-the-art Macro F1 score of 0.9120, significantly outperforming established rule-based systems, fine-tuned transformer models, and direct LLM inference, while maintaining a practical inference speed suitable for high-throughput applications. Our analysis shows particular strength in handling uncertain findings. This work demonstrates a promising path to overcome data annotation bottlenecks and achieve high-performance medical text processing through the strategic combination of LLM capabilities and efficient student models trained via distillation.

**TL;DR:** Proposes a Shapley Value-based non-uniform pruning method for large language models to optimize model size and performance.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Traditional pruning methods apply uniform sparsity across all layers, leading to suboptimal performance. This research aims to improve performance by considering the varying significance of transformer layers.

**Method:** The proposed method quantifies each transformer's layer contribution to model performance, allowing tailored pruning budgets. A Sliding Window-based Shapley Value approximation is used to reduce computational overhead.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Shapley Value-based non-uniform pruning method for LLMs
	2. Development of Sliding Window-based approximation for computational efficiency
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements on multiple LLMs

**Result:** Extensive experimentation shows that non-uniform pruning significantly enhances pruned model performance, with reported reductions in perplexity of 18.01% and 19.55% for LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70% sparsity.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Shapley Value-based non-uniform pruning method substantially outperforms traditional pruning approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance. Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being accounted for. To this end, we propose the \underline{S}hapley \underline{V}alue-based \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{P}runing (\methodname{}) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, \methodname{} achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01\% and 19.55\% on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70\% sparsity.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The goal is to determine if LLMs can maintain consistent evaluation metrics for machine-translated text, regardless of document length, a persistent problem in translation quality assessment.

**Method:** Several strategies are evaluated to mitigate the impact of text length on evaluation, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance LLM alignment with translation evaluation tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of LLMs in long document translation evaluation
	2. Introduction of Focus Sentence Prompting (FSP) to improve evaluation
	3. Fine-tuning methods that enhance LLM reliability for translation tasks

**Result:** Analysis indicates that longer texts can lead to fewer error spans and decreased ranking accuracy; however, the proposed methods largely alleviate this bias.

**Limitations:** The study is based on specific LLM architectures and may not generalize to all translation technologies or datasets.

**Conclusion:** By implementing FSP and fine-tuning, LLMs can become more reliable for evaluating long-form translations, thus improving evaluation consistency across varying text lengths.

**Abstract:** Accurately evaluating machine-translated text remains a long-standing challenge, particularly for long documents. Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable and interpretable sentence-level translation evaluators via MQM error span annotations. With modern LLMs supporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed entire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally, evaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans regardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length significantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and reduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate several strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the evaluation task. The latter two methods largely mitigate this length bias, making LLMs more reliable for long-form translation evaluation.

**Conclusion:** Integrating multimodal evaluation significantly enhances the assessment of soft skills, making it more transparent for stakeholders.

**Abstract:** In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the unbiased assessment of soft skills is a significant challenge, particularly in higher education. This paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable to educational stakeholders.

### [42] [$\textit{New News}$: System-2 Fine-tuning for Robust Integration of New Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01812)

*Core Francisco Park, Zechen Zhang, Hidenori Tanaka*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, fine-tuning, self-play, dataset

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the New News dataset to study the FT-ICL gap and proposes a novel fine-tuning method (Sys2-FT) that enhances large language models' ability to internalize news and learn from it effectively.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of improving fine-tuning in large language models, especially in consolidating learning from contextual information.

**Method:** The paper introduces a new dataset called New News and explores self-play data generation protocols like paraphrases, implications, and Self-QAs to facilitate effective fine-tuning, termed System-2 Fine-tuning (Sys2-FT).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the New News dataset for evaluating learning in LLMs
	2. Proposed Sys2-FT method for effective fine-tuning
	3. Discovery of the contextual shadowing effect impacting model learning

**Result:** The study demonstrates a significant improvement in models' learning capacity when utilizing the self-QA protocol in the Sys2-FT approach, highlighting the limitations of naive fine-tuning compared to in-context learning.

**Limitations:** Limited scope of the dataset; further investigation needed for broader applicability of results.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that Sys2-FT can substantially enhance the in-weight learning capabilities of models, though it also notes a negative impact from contextual shadowing when rephrasing or questioning the news content.

**Abstract:** Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information ("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2 Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the $\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

**Keywords:** Transformer models, Intra-Layer Recurrence, Natural language processing

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel approach called Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR) for optimizing transformer models by selectively applying recurrence to individual layers, yielding better performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of increasing parameter counts in deep transformer models by improving how recurrence is applied within their architecture.

**Method:** The paper introduces Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), which targets individual layers for recurrence within a single forward pass rather than applying recurrence uniformly across all layers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR) technique
	2. Empirical findings showing optimal performance by focusing recurrence on earlier layers
	3. Code available for implementation and further research

**Result:** Experiments revealed that allocating more iterations to earlier layers in the architecture significantly enhances model performance compared to traditional methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ILR has promising implications for optimizing recurrent structures in transformer architectures, potentially leading to more efficient models with fewer parameters.

**Abstract:** Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results. These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

**Conclusion:** This work provides a practical solution for reducing the training cost of BERT-based NER systems while keeping high accuracy.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) leveraging the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model in natural language processing (NLP). NER is a fundamental task in NLP with broad applicability across downstream applications. While BERT has established itself as a state-of-the-art model for entity recognition, fine-tuning it from scratch for each new application is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this, we propose a cost-efficient approach that integrates positional attention mechanisms into the entity recognition process and enables effective customization using pre-trained parameters. The framework is evaluated on a Kaggle dataset derived from the Groningen Meaning Bank corpus and achieves strong performance with fewer training epochs. This work contributes to the field by offering a practical solution for reducing the training cost of BERT-based NER systems while maintaining high accuracy.

*Jiří Milička, Anna Marklová, Ondřej Drobil, Eva Pospíšilová*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction, AI-generated text, Text discrimination, Feedback, Readability

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study explores learning to distinguish between human and AI texts using immediate feedback, revealing improved accuracy and self-assessment in participants.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine if individuals can learn to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated texts and improve their self-perceived competence through immediate feedback.

**Method:** The research involved generating texts using GPT-4o and presenting randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers under two conditions: with immediate feedback and without feedback until the end of the experiment. Participants were assessed on their accuracy, confidence levels, and judgments of readability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated effectiveness of immediate feedback in improving text discrimination skills
	2. Highlighted common misconceptions about AI-generated texts
	3. Provided insights into participant self-assessment accuracy

**Result:** Participants who received immediate feedback demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy and confidence calibration when identifying texts, correcting misconceptions about AI-generated characteristics.

**Limitations:** The study did not explore other potential variables that might influence text differentiation.

**Conclusion:** Targeted training with feedback can effectively teach individuals to differentiate between human and AI texts, improving their self-assessment and understanding of AI text features, which is relevant in educational settings.

**Abstract:** This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived readability.   We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.   Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely resolved among the feedback group.   The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in educational contexts.

Finally, we develop an interactive visualization interface to support exploration of sentiment trends and topic distributions across time and regions. This work contributes a scalable methodology for social media analysis in dynamic geopolitical contexts.

**Keywords:** misinformation detection, adversarial attacks, LLM, evidence retrieval, semantic equivalence

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** CAMOUFLAGE is an adversarial attack approach for misinformation detection systems, using LLMs to create rewrites that evade detection while maintaining semantic meaning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the adversarial vulnerabilities of evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which are complex and typically resilient to traditional black-box text-based attacks.

**Method:** CAMOUFLAGE employs a two-agent system comprising a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent to generate adversarial rewrites that mislead retrieval and comparison modules of detection systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a two-agent system for adversarial attacks
	2. Iterative prompt optimization for improved attack strategies
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness on various detection systems with a notable attack success rate

**Result:** The approach achieves an average attack success rate of 46.92% across four evaluated systems without compromising the coherence or meaning of the original claims.

**Limitations:** The attacks are evaluated on only four systems, and real-world applicability may vary.

**Conclusion:** CAMOUFLAGE presents a novel method for developing adversarial attacks that effectively navigate the complexities of misinformation detection systems, highlighting their vulnerabilities and potential areas for improvement.

**Abstract:** Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The growing integration of LLMs in daily life necessitates understanding their implicit socio-cognitive attitudes, particularly beyond established biases.

**Method:** The SWT categorizes four worldviews into measurable dimensions and employs empirical analysis across 28 LLMs, alongside experimental validation with social cues.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT) for LLMs
	2. Empirical identification of cognitive profiles across 28 LLMs
	3. Demonstration of the impact of social cues on model attitudes

**Result:** Distinct cognitive profiles were identified across LLMs, showing variances in response to social cues and illustrating the presence of implicit biases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Enhancing LLM interpretability through SWT reveals socio-cognitive biases and informs the creation of socially responsible language technologies.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, widely adopted in communication, decision-making, and information retrieval, raising critical questions about how these systems implicitly form and express socio-cognitive attitudes or "worldviews". While existing research extensively addresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews (Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable sub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable cognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social Referencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues systematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response patterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the interpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their responsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance information accessibility on the web for users whose reading levels may not match the complexity of texts in fields like health and science.

**Method:** A randomized study with 4563 participants tested comprehension of original versus simplified texts across six subject areas, measuring performance through multiple-choice questions and qualitative feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a minimally lossy text simplification method using LLMs
	2. Validation through a large-scale randomized study
	3. Demonstration of improved comprehension and perceived ease of understanding for users

**Result:** Participants reading simplified texts scored 3.9% higher in comprehension, particularly notable in the PubMed domain with a 14.6% increase. Self-reported ease of understanding also increased for simplified texts.

**Limitations:** Focuses on specific subject areas; results may not generalize to all types of texts or audiences.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates LLMs' potential to simplify complex information, thereby making expert knowledge more accessible to a wider audience.

**Abstract:** Information on the web, such as scientific publications and Wikipedia, often surpasses users' reading level. To help address this, we used a self-refinement approach to develop a LLM capability for minimally lossy text simplification. To validate our approach, we conducted a randomized study involving 4563 participants and 31 texts spanning 6 broad subject areas: PubMed (biomedical scientific articles), biology, law, finance, literature/philosophy, and aerospace/computer science. Participants were randomized to viewing original or simplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text. The participants were also asked to provide qualitative feedback such as task difficulty. Our results indicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs correctly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute increase, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more moderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science (3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%). Notably, the results were robust to whether participants could refer back to the text while answering MCQs. The absolute accuracy decreased by up to ~9% for both original and simplified setups where participants could not refer back to the text, but the ~4% overall improvement persisted. Finally, participants' self-reported perceived ease based on a simplified NASA Task Load Index was greater for those who read the simplified text (absolute change on a 5-point scale 0.33, p<0.05). This randomized study, involving an order of magnitude more participants than prior works, demonstrates the potential of LLMs to make complex information easier to understand. Our work aims to enable a broader audience to better learn and make use of expert knowledge available on the web, improving information accessibility.

**Motivation:** To address the presence of harmful content in datasets used for training large language models, which can perpetuate misinformation and societal biases.

**Method:** The paper presents a taxonomy categorizing harmful webpages, introduces a prompt evaluation dataset, and a filtering model named HarmFormer for content moderation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive taxonomy of harmful content in LLM training datasets
	2. Introduction of the HarmFormer model for content filtering
	3. Development of the HAVOC toxicity benchmark for evaluating model responses to toxic inputs

**Result:** The analysis reveals widespread inappropriate content in pretraining datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of the HarmFormer model in filtering toxic inputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of content moderation in LLM pretraining to ensure safer AI applications and aid in achieving Responsible AI compliance.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. Upon publishing, we will also opensource our model signal on the entire C4 dataset. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

**Motivation:** The growing demand for language learning support amidst resource constraints on human teachers necessitates AI-driven solutions in CALL.

**Method:** A comprehensive survey of AI applications within language learning contexts, highlighting interdisciplinary approaches and practical challenges.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Surveys various AI methods applicable in language learning.
	2. Highlights the need for integration and completeness in existing CALL systems.
	3. Encourages interdisciplinary collaboration to advance CALL technologies.

**Result:** Identifies gaps in existing CALL systems that are often only partial implementations and discusses potential directions for integrating AI more effectively in language education.

**Limitations:** Limited number of fully integrated systems; existing solutions often rely on prototypes or partial implementations.

**Conclusion:** Advancements in AI can enhance CALL systems, yet a survey of existing literature reveals a disparity in complete solutions; interdisciplinary collaborations are essential for progress.

**Abstract:** Computer-assisted language learning -- CALL -- is an established research field. We review how artificial intelligence can be applied to support language learning and teaching. The need for intelligent agents that assist language learners and teachers is increasing: the human teacher's time is a scarce and costly resource, which does not scale with growing demand. Further factors contribute to the need for CALL: pandemics and increasing demand for distance learning, migration of large populations, the need for sustainable and affordable support for learning, etc. CALL systems are made up of many components that perform various functions, and AI is applied to many different aspects in CALL, corresponding to their own expansive research areas. Most of what we find in the research literature and in practical use are prototypes or partial implementations -- systems that perform some aspects of the overall desired functionality. Complete solutions -- most of them commercial -- are few, because they require massive resources. Recent advances in AI should result in improvements in CALL, yet there is a lack of surveys that focus on AI in the context of this research field. This paper aims to present a perspective on the AI methods that can be employed for language learning from a position of a developer of a CALL system. We also aim to connect work from different disciplines, to build bridges for interdisciplinary work.

**Result:** It identifies three distinct intended output distributions for LLMs and highlights common assumptions that lead to misinterpretations in NLP research.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work establishes more robust formal foundations for interpreting LLMs, aiding in the understanding and application of their output distributions.

**Abstract:** The notion of language modeling has gradually shifted in recent years from a distribution over finite-length strings to general-purpose prediction models for textual inputs and outputs, following appropriate alignment phases. This paper analyzes the distinction between distribution estimation and response prediction in the context of LLMs, and their often conflicting goals. We examine the training phases of LLMs, which include pretraining, in-context learning, and preference tuning, and also the common use cases for their output probabilities, which include completion probabilities and explicit probabilities as output. We argue that the different settings lead to three distinct intended output distributions. We demonstrate that NLP works often assume that these distributions should be similar, which leads to misinterpretations of their experimental findings. Our work sets firmer formal foundations for the interpretation of LLMs, which will inform ongoing work on the interpretation and use of LLMs' induced distributions.

Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity to output length, emphasizing that increasing reasoning length should align with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing and training methodologies, offering empirical evidence and practical insights for developing more cost-effective Offline RL approaches.

**Motivation:** The need to relieve the programming burden of developing multiple low-level tensor programs for various deep learning systems (DLS) in industrial data centers.

**Method:** QiMeng-Xpiler employs large language models for code generation, combined with symbolic program synthesis for code correction, and includes a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to optimize transformation parameters and sequences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of QiMeng-Xpiler for automatic tensor program translation.

**Result:** QiMeng-Xpiler translates tensor programs with an accuracy of 95% and improves performance by up to 2.0 times compared to manually-optimized libraries, enhancing programming productivity by up to 96.0x.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach not only addresses the challenge of transcompilation but also significantly boosts programming efficiency in heterogeneous DLS environments.

**Abstract:** Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple low-level tensor programs for different platforms. An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.   We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Adaptive Mode Learning (AML), a framework that employs a novel AMPO algorithm to enable language agents to dynamically adjust their reasoning depth based on context, resulting in improved social intelligence performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current methods lack the ability to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal social simulation. This work aims to introduce a more nuanced approach to social intelligence simulation.

**Method:** The framework includes four thinking modes and utilizes the AMPO algorithm for context-aware mode switching and token-efficient reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the AMPO algorithm for adaptive reasoning.
	2. Implementation of multi-granular thinking modes.
	3. Demonstration of context-aware mode switching for improved efficiency.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than existing methods, with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains compared to GRPO.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Context-sensitive thinking mode selection allows for human-like adaptive reasoning, improving overall social intelligence performance of language agents.

**Abstract:** Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach

**Abstract:** This paper presents a domain-specific implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tailored to the Fair Use Doctrine in U.S. copyright law. Motivated by the increasing prevalence of DMCA takedowns and the lack of accessible legal support for content creators, we propose a structured approach that combines semantic search with legal knowledge graphs and court citation networks to improve retrieval quality and reasoning reliability. Our prototype models legal precedents at the statutory factor level (e.g., purpose, nature, amount, market effect) and incorporates citation-weighted graph representations to prioritize doctrinally authoritative sources. We use Chain-of-Thought reasoning and interleaved retrieval steps to better emulate legal reasoning. Preliminary testing suggests this method improves doctrinal relevance in the retrieval process, laying groundwork for future evaluation and deployment of LLM-based legal assistance tools.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the gap in frameworks analyzing the impact of different chunking methods on LLM sensitivity to data layout and structure before indexing.

**Method:** Introduces HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), an automatic evaluation metric that quantifies intrinsic and extrinsic passage properties and coherence, supported by empirical evaluations across seven domains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HOPE as an automatic evaluation metric for chunking in RAG
	2. Identification of the importance of semantic independence for system performance
	3. Insightful findings challenging traditional assumptions about concept unity in passages.

**Result:** Empirical evaluations show significant correlation of the HOPE metric with RAG performance indicators, highlighting that semantic independence between passages enhances factual and answer correctness by substantial margins.

**Limitations:** Limited to empirical evaluations across seven domains, further work needed to explore additional contexts.

**Conclusion:** Optimizing chunking strategies guided by HOPE can improve RAG system design and response accuracy.

**Abstract:** Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce more factually correct responses.

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) on the CaseHOLD legal benchmark dataset, demonstrating improvements in model performance with size and presenting a novel citation anonymization test to ensure result integrity.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess how large language models perform on established legal benchmarks, such as CaseHOLD, and understand their capabilities and limitations in legal tasks.

**Method:** A suite of experiments was conducted on multiple LLMs ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters, including a novel citation anonymization test to measure performance without relying on memorization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of scaling effects in LLM performance on legal tasks.
	2. Introduction of a citation anonymization test to validate model performance.
	3. Competitive macro F1 scores indicating strong LLM capabilities without sophisticated training.

**Result:** LLMs showed a scaling effect, with top models achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720, and maintained strong performance with a macro F1 of 0.728 under anonymization conditions.

**Limitations:** The study does not explore the implications of LLMs' performance on real-world legal decision-making.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal both the potential and limits of LLMs in legal contexts, emphasizing the need for careful measurement in automated legal analytics.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study, we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs (ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' - performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720 respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training, fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics and legal benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models in Hong Kong's unique multilingual and socio-cultural environment, which combines Traditional Chinese with Cantonese.

**Method:** Introduced HKMMLU, a benchmark consisting of 26,698 multi-choice questions covering various subjects and 90,550 Mandarin-Cantonese translation tasks, and tested multiple LLMs on this benchmark.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of HKMMLU benchmark for LLMs
	2. Inclusion of extensive Hong Kong-specific questions
	3. Analysis of factors affecting LLM performance on multilingual tasks

**Result:** The best-performing model, DeepSeek-V3, achieved only 75% accuracy on HKMMLU, highlighting significant performance gaps compared to other benchmarks like MMLU and CMMLU.

**Limitations:** The performance of the models tested remains lower than needed for effectiveness in Hong Kong-specific contexts.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the need for improved capabilities in LLMs to handle Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge, and anticipates HKMMLU to facilitate advancements in multilingual contexts.

**Abstract:** Multilingual understanding is crucial for the cross-cultural applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, evaluation benchmarks designed for Hong Kong's unique linguistic landscape, which combines Traditional Chinese script with Cantonese as the spoken form and its cultural context, remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce HKMMLU, a multi-task language understanding benchmark that evaluates Hong Kong's linguistic competence and socio-cultural knowledge. The HKMMLU includes 26,698 multi-choice questions across 66 subjects, organized into four categories: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), Social Sciences, Humanities, and Other. To evaluate the multilingual understanding ability of LLMs, 90,550 Mandarin-Cantonese translation tasks were additionally included. We conduct comprehensive experiments on GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and 18 open-source LLMs of varying sizes on HKMMLU. The results show that the best-performing model, DeepSeek-V3, struggles to achieve an accuracy of 75\%, significantly lower than that of MMLU and CMMLU. This performance gap highlights the need to improve LLMs' capabilities in Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge domains. Furthermore, we investigate how question language, model size, prompting strategies, and question and reasoning token lengths affect model performance. We anticipate that HKMMLU will significantly advance the development of LLMs in multilingual and cross-cultural contexts, thereby enabling broader and more impactful applications.

**Abstract:** Evaluating text summarization quality remains a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing. Current approaches face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by decomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high performance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first extracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a matching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide only summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its decisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing GPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability. Finally, our framework shows robustness against hallucination.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to understand the effects of personalising responses in LLMs, particularly in sensitive areas like hate speech, where contextual factors can lead to biases.

**Method:** The paper examines state-of-the-art LLMs in various personalisation scenarios, prompting them to adopt country-specific personas and different languages for hate speech detection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of state-of-the-art LLMs in personalisation scenarios for hate speech detection.
	2. Demonstration of the significant impact of context on LLM behaviour.
	3. Development of fine-tuning strategies to improve LLM performance in sensitive contexts.

**Result:** Findings indicate that LLM responses are significantly influenced by context personalisation in hate speech detection, and fine-tuning models can reduce bias and improve classification consistency.

**Limitations:** The study may not account for all possible personalisation scenarios or the full range of sensitive topics.

**Conclusion:** The refined models show enhanced performance in detecting hate speech across both personalised and generic contexts, suggesting a pathway to mitigate biases in LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently incorporated memory features to deliver personalised responses. This memory retains details such as user demographics and individual characteristics, allowing LLMs to adjust their behaviour based on personal information. However, the impact of integrating personalised information into the context has not been thoroughly assessed, leading to questions about its influence on LLM behaviour. Personalisation can be challenging, particularly with sensitive topics. In this paper, we examine various state-of-the-art LLMs to understand their behaviour in different personalisation scenarios, specifically focusing on hate speech. We prompt the models to assume country-specific personas and use different languages for hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that context personalisation significantly influences LLMs' responses in this sensitive area. To mitigate these unwanted biases, we fine-tune the LLMs by penalising inconsistent hate speech classifications made with and without country or language-specific context. The refined models demonstrate improved performance in both personalised contexts and when no context is provided.

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiencies of embedding layers in transformer models that scale with vocabulary size but do not yield proportional performance gains.

**Method:** Token embedding vectors are generated deterministically from token IDs using a Fourier expansion of normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) to capture higher-order interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a Fourier expansion approach for token embeddings
	2. Performance improvements with fewer parameters
	3. Validation of zero-shot performance on STS-B using the proposed method.

**Result:** The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and faster training compared to standard transformers, effectively operating without dropout.

**Limitations:** This is a proof-of-concept study and further large-scale experimentation is needed to validate the findings.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest a promising direction for creating scalable and memory-efficient language models, warranting further large-scale experimentation.

**Abstract:** Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale experimentation based on our findings.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the distinct characteristics of optimized prompts and suggest avenues for improving language model robustness to out-of-distribution inputs.

**Abstract:** Modern language models (LMs) are not robust to out-of-distribution inputs. Machine generated (``optimized'') prompts can be used to modulate LM outputs and induce specific behaviors while appearing completely uninterpretable. In this work, we investigate the composition of optimized prompts, as well as the mechanisms by which LMs parse and build predictions from optimized prompts. We find that optimized prompts primarily consist of punctuation and noun tokens which are more rare in the training data. Internally, optimized prompts are clearly distinguishable from natural language counterparts based on sparse subsets of the model's activations. Across various families of instruction-tuned models, optimized prompts follow a similar path in how their representations form through the network.

**Abstract:** Sign language recognition (SLR) faces fundamental challenges in creating accurate annotations due to the inherent complexity of simultaneous manual and non-manual signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate generative large language models (LLMs) into SLR tasks. We propose a novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning (GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching. Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against existing methods on the Chinese SLR500 (reaching 97.1%) and Turkish AUTSL datasets (97.07% accuracy). The method's cross-lingual effectiveness highlight its potential for developing inclusive communication technologies.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces AttenHScore, a new metric for detecting hallucinations in small language models during generation, aiming to enhance real-time invocation of larger models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective and cost-efficient invocation of language models while minimizing hallucinations and improving reasoning accuracy.

**Method:** The paper proposes AttenHScore, which calculates the accumulation and propagation of hallucinations and adjusts the detection threshold for better real-time performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AttenHScore for hallucination detection
	2. Real-time invocation of large LMs through dynamic threshold adjustment
	3. Uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization for small LMs.

**Result:** AttenHScore outperforms baseline metrics in enhancing hallucination detection on various QA datasets, particularly for complex queries.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach provides a practical solution to improve real-time performance in large language models without the need for additional training, offering flexibility for various transformer-based models.

**Abstract:** The collaborative paradigm of large and small language models (LMs) effectively balances performance and cost, yet its pivotal challenge lies in precisely pinpointing the moment of invocation when hallucinations arise in small LMs. Previous optimization efforts primarily focused on post-processing techniques, which were separate from the reasoning process of LMs, resulting in high computational costs and limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a practical invocation evaluation metric called AttenHScore, which calculates the accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during the generation process of small LMs, continuously amplifying potential reasoning errors. By dynamically adjusting the detection threshold, we achieve more accurate real-time invocation of large LMs. Additionally, considering the limited reasoning capacity of small LMs, we leverage uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization to assist them better capture critical information from different text chunks. Extensive experiments reveal that our AttenHScore outperforms most baseline in enhancing real-time hallucination detection capabilities across multiple QA datasets, especially when addressing complex queries. Moreover, our strategies eliminate the need for additional model training and display flexibility in adapting to various transformer-based LMs.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need to systematically explore the relative benefits of on-policy vs off-policy data in preference learning for language models, as existing studies show mixed results.

**Method:** The paper introduces an approach called SIMPLEMIX that combines on-policy and off-policy data for preference optimization by mixing these sources together.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SIMPLEMIX for combining on-policy and off-policy data
	2. Demonstrated task-specific advantages of data types in preference learning
	3. Empirical results showcasing significant performance improvement in language model alignment

**Result:** SIMPLEMIX demonstrates improved language model alignment, enhancing results by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0 compared to on-policy and off-policy DPO, and outperforms more complex methods by an average of 3.05%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SIMPLEMIX effectively leverages the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy data, leading to substantial improvements in preference alignment across various tasks.

**Abstract:** Aligning language models with human preferences relies on pairwise preference datasets. While some studies suggest that on-policy data consistently outperforms off -policy data for preference learning, others indicate that the advantages of on-policy data may be task-dependent, highlighting the need for a systematic exploration of their interplay.   In this work, we show that on-policy and off-policy data offer complementary strengths in preference optimization: on-policy data is particularly effective for reasoning tasks like math and coding, while off-policy data performs better on open-ended tasks such as creative writing and making personal recommendations. Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach to combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference learning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across diverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves language model alignment. Specifically, SIMPLEMIX improves upon on-policy DPO and off-policy DPO by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0. Moreover, it outperforms prior approaches that are much more complex in combining on- and off-policy data, such as HyPO and DPO-Mix-P, by an average of 3.05%.

**TL;DR:** Introducing JTCSE, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework that enhances sentence embeddings by combining modulus constraints and cross-attention.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing unsupervised contrastive learning methods in NLP that ignore modulus features of semantic representations.

**Method:** Proposes a training objective introducing modulus constraints on semantic representation tensors and a cross-attention structure in twin-tower models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of modulus constraints on semantics in contrastive learning.
	2. Development of a cross-attention structure to enhance model focus on CLS tokens.
	3. Demonstration of superior performance in both similarity tasks and zero-shot evaluations.

**Result:** JTCSE demonstrates superior performance over baseline models in seven semantic text similarity tasks and shows strong results in zero-shot downstream task evaluations across over 130 tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** JTCSE outperforms existing models and establishes a new state-of-the-art approach in sentence embedding representation.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new \textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and \textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence \textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

**Read time:** 20 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing reward models for large language models lack interpretability and struggle to integrate natural language critiques, prompting the need for enhanced reward modeling techniques.

**Method:** The authors propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline for ReasRMs, which involves distilling high-quality reasoning chains and utilizing reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs)
	2. A new training pipeline focusing on reasoning integration
	3. Empirical evidence of improved performance against larger models

**Result:** ReasRMs demonstrate significant improvements in LLM rollouts and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple reward model benchmarks, outperforming larger models by up to 13.8%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The incorporation of reasoning capabilities into reward modeling enhances interpretability and performance, making ReasRMs a promising approach for future research in the field.

**Abstract:** Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A call for fairness researchers to adopt intersectional and multilingual approaches in their evaluation of biases in NLP systems.

**Abstract:** One of the goals of fairness research in NLP is to measure and mitigate stereotypical biases that are propagated by NLP systems. However, such work tends to focus on single axes of bias (most often gender) and the English language. Addressing these limitations, we contribute the first study of multilingual intersecting country and gender biases, with a focus on occupation recommendations generated by large language models. We construct a benchmark of prompts in English, Spanish and German, where we systematically vary country and gender, using 25 countries and four pronoun sets. Then, we evaluate a suite of 5 Llama-based models on this benchmark, finding that LLMs encode significant gender and country biases. Notably, we find that even when models show parity for gender or country individually, intersectional occupational biases based on both country and gender persist. We also show that the prompting language significantly affects bias, and instruction-tuned models consistently demonstrate the lowest and most stable levels of bias. Our findings highlight the need for fairness researchers to use intersectional and multilingual lenses in their work.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional artificial neural networks in handling linguistic ambiguities and uncertainties in sentence processing.

**Method:** The authors extended the ensemble Kalman filter for Bayesian inference to create a framework for sentence comprehension, treating it as a Bayesian inverse problem.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a Bayesian framework for sentence comprehension
	2. Application of the ensemble Kalman filter for uncertainty quantification
	3. Comparison with maximum likelihood estimation showing improved performance

**Result:** Bayesian methods significantly improve the representation of uncertainty, allowing the model to better approximate human cognitive processing in the context of ambiguous sentences.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach enhances existing models, like the Sentence Gestalt Model, offering a more human-like understanding of language by quantifying uncertainty.

**Abstract:** Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.

Additionally, we examine text-based proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust automated L2 proficiency evaluation.

Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards. We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges and future directions. We maintain a paper collection at https://github.com/bobxwu/learning-from-rewards-llm-papers.

**Motivation:** The paper aims to evaluate whether LLMs can effectively adhere to complex legal citation standards outlined in The Bluebook, which is critical for legal practitioners and law review editors.

**Method:** An original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks was constructed, and flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek were tested for their citation compliance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a dataset of Bluebook citation tasks for LLM evaluation
	2. Demonstration of LLMs' limitations in legal citation accuracy
	3. Analysis of the impact of in-context learning on citation compliance

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on a limited set of LLMs and specific citation tasks, which may not represent broader capabilities in varying legal contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that off-the-shelf LLMs should be approached with caution in automated legal processes due to their inadequate adherence to procedural fidelity.

**Abstract:** Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1) that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure is paramount.

	1. A novel training-free depth pruning method
	2. Demonstrates the ability to achieve significant pruning (up to 25%) with minimal performance loss
	3. Provides an open-source library for implementation.

**Result:** ReplaceMe demonstrates superior performance compared to other training-free methods and remains competitive with state-of-the-art pruning techniques, achieving up to 25% pruning while maintaining around 90% performance on benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ReplaceMe offers an efficient solution for pruning transformer models, facilitating high compression ratios without additional computational burdens, making it suitable for large language models.

**Abstract:** We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SMUTF's versatility and efficacy make it a promising approach for schema matching tasks, with an open-sourced HDXSM dataset that aids in further research.

**Abstract:** We introduce SMUTF (Schema Matching Using Generative Tags and Hybrid Features), a unique approach for large-scale tabular data schema matching (SM), which assumes that supervised learning does not affect performance in open-domain tasks, thereby enabling effective cross-domain matching. This system uniquely combines rule-based feature engineering, pre-trained language models, and generative large language models. In an innovative adaptation inspired by the Humanitarian Exchange Language, we deploy "generative tags" for each data column, enhancing the effectiveness of SM. SMUTF exhibits extensive versatility, working seamlessly with any pre-existing pre-trained embeddings, classification methods, and generative models.   Recognizing the lack of extensive, publicly available datasets for SM, we have created and open-sourced the HDXSM dataset from the public humanitarian data. We believe this to be the most exhaustive SM dataset currently available. In evaluations across various public datasets and the novel HDXSM dataset, SMUTF demonstrated exceptional performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and improving the F1 score by 11.84% and the AUC of ROC by 5.08%.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address limitations in current constrained decoding methods for LLMs by incorporating cognitive dual-process theory, enabling a more natural logic in text generation.

**Method:** DECIDER combines a First-Order Logic reasoner with a decision function, guiding text generation by evaluating rules and transforming target-specific outputs into words fulfilling high-level rules.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel decoding framework (DECIDER) for LLMs.
	2. Integration of First-Order Logic reasoning into text generation.
	3. Empirical validation demonstrating improved human-like logic control in outputs.

**Result:** Experiments show that DECIDER can effectively guide LLMs in a human-like manner by following FOL rules, outperforming traditional approaches in tasks like CommonGen and PersonaChat.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DECIDER represents a significant advance in improving the relevance and coherence of LLM outputs by integrating logical reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of text generated by the pre-trained large language models (LLMs or also PLMs) for various tasks at inference time. However, these methods often guide plausible continuations by greedily and explicitly selecting targets. Though fulfilling the task requirements, these methods may overlook certain general and natural logics that humans would implicitly follow towards such targets. Inspired by cognitive dual-process theory, in this work, we propose a novel decoding framework DECIDER where the base LLMs are equipped with a First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoner to express and evaluate the rules, along with a decision function that merges the outputs of both systems to guide the generation. Unlike previous constrained decodings, DECIDER transforms the encouragement of target-specific words into all words that satisfy several high-level rules, enabling us to programmatically integrate our logic into LLMs. Experiments on CommonGen and PersonaChat demonstrate that DECIDER effectively follows given FOL rules to guide LLMs in a more human-like and logic-controlled manner.

**Motivation:** The performance of few-shot in-context learning in LLMs is dependent on the choice and length of demonstration examples, impacting overall accuracy.

**Method:** ParaICL uses parallel batching to group demonstration examples based on semantic similarity to the test question, allowing model input to remain within a manageable context length.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ParaICL for improved few-shot learning in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of parallel batching to manage context length
	3. Validation through extensive experiments and ablation studies

**Result:** ParaICL significantly improves accuracy across various test samples by optimizing the selection of tokens and leveraging all demonstration examples without exceeding input limits.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The effectiveness of ParaICL is validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies, highlighting its potential for integration with existing methods.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become the norm in natural language processing (NLP), excelling in few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with their remarkable abilities. Nonetheless, the success of ICL largely hinges on the choice of few-shot demonstration examples, making the selection process increasingly crucial. Existing methods have delved into optimizing the quantity and semantic similarity of these examples to improve ICL performances. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that the effectiveness of ICL is limited by the length of the input context. Moreover, varying combinations of few-shot demonstration examples can significantly boost accuracy across different test samples. To address this, we propose a novel method named parallel in-context learning (ParaICL) that effectively utilizes all demonstration examples without exceeding the manageable input context length. ParaICL employs parallel batching to distribute demonstration examples into different batches according to the semantic similarities of the questions in the demonstrations to the test question. It then computes normalized batch semantic scores for each batch. A weighted average semantic objective, constrained by adaptive plausibility, is applied to select the most appropriate tokens. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of ParaICL and conduct ablation studies to underscore its design rationale. We further demonstrate that ParaICL can seamlessly integrate with existing methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MBS provides a unique solution to improve language inclusivity in LLM compression techniques, effectively addressing performance disparities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era in Natural Language Processing, but their massive size demands effective compression techniques for practicality. Although numerous model compression techniques have been investigated, they typically rely on a calibration set that overlooks the multilingual context and results in significant accuracy degradation for low-resource languages. This paper introduces Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS), a novel calibration data sampling method for multilingual LLMs compression. MBS overcomes the English-centric limitations of existing methods by sampling calibration data from various languages proportionally to the language distribution of the model training datasets. Our experiments, conducted on the BLOOM multilingual LLM, demonstrate that MBS improves the performance of existing English-centric compression methods, especially for low-resource languages. We also uncover the dynamics of language interaction during compression, revealing that the larger the proportion of a language in the training set and the more similar the language is to the calibration language, the better performance the language retains after compression. In conclusion, MBS presents an innovative approach to compressing multilingual LLMs, addressing the performance disparities and improving the language inclusivity of existing compression techniques.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Cline is the first large dataset for evaluating human acceptability of English-Hindi code-mixed sentences, revealing limitations in existing metrics and demonstrating that fine-tuned MLLMs outperform simpler models in this task.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To model human judgement on the acceptability of code-mixed text for better analysis and generation of such sentences.

**Method:** Constructed the Cline dataset with 16,642 sentences, analyzing the correlation between existing code-mixing metrics and human acceptability judgements, and evaluated different MLLMs' performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Cline dataset for English-Hindi code-mixed sentences
	2. Demonstration of low correlation between existing metrics and human acceptability
	3. Showcasing the performance of MLLMs in code-mixed acceptability tasks

**Result:** Fine-tuned pre-trained MLLMs, particularly Llama 3.2 - 3B, outperform simpler MLP models and existing metrics in understanding code-mixed text acceptability.

**Limitations:** The focus is limited to English-Hindi code-mixed text, which may not generalize to other languages or dialects.

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the importance of a human-judged dataset for code-mixing and the superiority of MLLMs over traditional models in this domain.

**Abstract:** Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model ``naturalness'' or ``acceptability'' of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi~(en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models when trained solely using code-mixing metrics as features are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, among Encoder models XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations. Among Encoder-Decoder models, mBART performs better than mT5, however Encoder-Decoder models are not able to outperform Encoder-only models. Decoder-only models perform the best when compared to all other MLLMS, with Llama 3.2 - 3B models outperforming similarly sized Qwen, Phi models. Comparison with zero and fewshot capabilitites of ChatGPT show that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from En-Hi to En-Te acceptability judgments are better than random baselines.

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses the embedding of hidden text in LLMs via fine-tuning and reveals vulnerabilities to extraction attacks, introducing a novel defense method.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the security of hidden text embedded in LLMs and to propose methods for reliable extraction and defense against such attacks.

**Method:** An extraction attack called Unconditional Token Forcing (UTF) is introduced, which analyzes the LLM's output to extract hidden sequences. A defense strategy, Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion (UTFC), is proposed to enhance security without degrading performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Unconditional Token Forcing for extraction attacks
	2. Development of Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion as a novel defense
	3. Demonstration of both benign and malign applications of hidden text in LLMs

**Result:** The study shows that while fine-tuning can embed hidden text securely, it is susceptible to UTF extraction. The UTFC method successfully defends against these extractions while maintaining LLM performance.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address potential real-world applicability or performance benchmarks in varied environments.

**Conclusion:** Embedding hidden text in LLMs can be a security risk, but with appropriate defenses like UTFC, the risks can be mitigated without sacrificing model performance.

**Abstract:** Simple fine-tuning can embed hidden text into large language models (LLMs), which is revealed only when triggered by a specific query. Applications include LLM fingerprinting, where a unique identifier is embedded to verify licensing compliance, and steganography, where the LLM carries hidden messages disclosed through a trigger query.   Our work demonstrates that embedding hidden text via fine-tuning, although seemingly secure due to the vast number of potential triggers, is vulnerable to extraction through analysis of the LLM's output decoding process. We introduce an extraction attack called Unconditional Token Forcing (UTF), which iteratively feeds tokens from the LLM's vocabulary to reveal sequences with high token probabilities, indicating hidden text candidates. We also present Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion (UTFC), a defense paradigm that makes hidden text resistant to all known extraction attacks without degrading the general performance of LLMs compared to standard fine-tuning. UTFC has both benign (improving LLM fingerprinting) and malign applications (using LLMs to create covert communication channels).

**Conclusion:** The work emphasizes the necessity of addressing evaluation trade-offs in LMMs and offers practical tools for effective benchmarking.

**Abstract:** The advances of large foundation models necessitate wide-coverage, low-cost, and zero-contamination benchmarks. Despite continuous exploration of language model evaluations, comprehensive studies on the evaluation of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) remain limited. In this work, we introduce LMMS-EVAL, a unified and standardized multimodal benchmark framework with over 50 tasks and more than 10 models to promote transparent and reproducible evaluations. Although LMMS-EVAL offers comprehensive coverage, we find it still falls short in achieving low cost and zero contamination. To approach this evaluation trilemma, we further introduce LMMS-EVAL LITE, a pruned evaluation toolkit that emphasizes both coverage and efficiency. Additionally, we present Multimodal LIVEBENCH that utilizes continuously updating news and online forums to assess models' generalization abilities in the wild, featuring a low-cost and zero-contamination evaluation approach. In summary, our work highlights the importance of considering the evaluation trilemma and provides practical solutions to navigate the trade-offs in evaluating large multi-modal models, paving the way for more effective and reliable benchmarking of LMMs. We opensource our codebase and maintain leaderboard of LIVEBENCH at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval and https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab/LiveBench.

**Conclusion:** Awareness of logical fallacies is crucial for LLMs to generate effective arguments, and FIPO shows significant improvements in argument quality.

**Abstract:** Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation. Our code is available at github.com/lucamouchel/Logical-Fallacies.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study successfully demonstrates the potential of pre-trained language models in virtual lipid applications, highlighting the integration of dry-wet lab data for improved screening tasks.

**Abstract:** In this study, we generate and maintain a database of 10 million virtual lipids through METiS's in-house de novo lipid generation algorithms and lipid virtual screening techniques. These virtual lipids serve as a corpus for pre-training, lipid representation learning, and downstream task knowledge transfer, culminating in state-of-the-art LNP property prediction performance. We propose LipidBERT, a BERT-like model pre-trained with the Masked Language Model (MLM) and various secondary tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of embeddings generated by LipidBERT and PhatGPT, our GPT-like lipid generation model, on downstream tasks. The proposed bilingual LipidBERT model operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training, using in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning, utilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT as a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of METiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo testing for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language model on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab data. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo lipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.

**Motivation:** To investigate how language emergence is influenced by subjective experiences and to explore the implications of this relationship.

**Method:** The paper employs theoretical frameworks like collective predictive coding and presents computational studies on neural network-based language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a bidirectional influence between language emergence and qualia structure.
	2. Links language development to AI advancements and symbol emergence robotics.
	3. Suggests computational studies show structured internal representations in language models.

**Result:** The findings suggest that language emergence not only serves as a communication mechanism but also aids in achieving shared understanding of qualitative experiences.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper highlights the importance of understanding the bidirectional influence between language and qualia structure, recommending future research to explore this dynamic further.

**Abstract:** This perspective paper explores the bidirectional influence between language emergence and the relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out a constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that the emergence of languages with distributional semantics (e.g., syntactic-semantic structures) is linked to the coordination of internal representations shaped by experience, potentially facilitating more structured language through reciprocal influence. This hypothesized mutual dependency connects to recent advancements in AI and symbol emergence robotics, and is explored within this paper through theoretical frameworks such as the collective predictive coding. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional influence in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for better handling of out-of-scope questions in LLMs, especially when existing systems may generate hallucinated answers due to limitations in their training.

**Method:** The ELOQ approach generates a diverse set of out-of-scope questions from post-cutoff documents, which are then verified by humans for quality. This dataset is utilized to assess LLMs on their detection capability and response generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a guided hallucination-based approach (ELOQ) for generating out-of-scope questions.
	2. Human verification process to ensure the quality of generated questions.
	3. Introduction of an improved detection method for LLMs addressing out-of-scope questions.

**Result:** An improved detection method for out-of-scope questions enhances the reliability of LLM-based systems in conversational AI.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the approach may vary depending on the quality of the retrieved documents and LLMs' architecture.

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods and dataset improve the capability of LLMs to handle out-of-scope questions, reducing hallucinations and increasing response accuracy.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become integral to large language models (LLMs), particularly for conversational AI systems where user questions may reference knowledge beyond the LLMs' training cutoff. However, many natural user questions lack well-defined answers, either due to limited domain knowledge or because the retrieval system returns documents that are relevant in appearance but uninformative in content. In such cases, LLMs often produce hallucinated answers without flagging them. While recent work has largely focused on questions with false premises, we study out-of-scope questions, where the retrieved document appears semantically similar to the question but lacks the necessary information to answer it. In this paper, we propose a guided hallucination-based approach ELOQ to automatically generate a diverse set of out-of-scope questions from post-cutoff documents, followed by human verification to ensure quality. We use this dataset to evaluate several LLMs on their ability to detect out-of-scope questions and generate appropriate responses. Finally, we introduce an improved detection method that enhances the reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems in handling out-of-scope questions.

**Motivation:** The potential of large language models in anomaly detection has not been adequately explored, despite their effectiveness in other NLP tasks.

**Limitations:** The paper acknowledges that explaining model selection remains a challenge.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the promising role of LLMs in anomaly detection and lay out six research directions for further exploration.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether combining the strengths of bidirectional transformers like ELECTRA with large language models like GPT-4o can enhance performance in sentiment analysis tasks.

**Method:** Four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) were fine-tuned using a dataset from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and DynaSent, with ELECTRA providing predicted labels and probabilities to GPT for classification enhancements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated improving sentiment classification performance through collaboration between ELECTRA and GPT-4o.
	2. Introduced a cost-effective method for sentiment analysis using LLMs with fine-tuned encoders.
	3. Showed that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini can achieve almost comparable results to GPT-4o FT at significantly lower cost.

**Result:** ELECTRA Base FT predictions significantly improved GPT-4o-mini's performance (82.50 macro F1) compared to standalone models, while fine-tuned GPT-4o showed the highest performance (86.99 macro F1), demonstrating the effectiveness of this collaborative approach.

**Limitations:** Including predictions in fine-tuning of GPT models reduced performance, indicating a potential drawback in certain collaborative setups.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient method to improve model performance, with cost-effective alternatives available for projects on a budget.

**Abstract:** Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.50 macro F1 vs. 79.14 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.41 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.70) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.

**Conclusion:** LUSIFER demonstrates the potential of adapting LLM-based models for multilingual applications without explicit multilingual training data, setting new benchmarks in multilingual embeddings.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based embedding models have established new state-of-the-art benchmarks for text embedding tasks, particularly in dense vector-based retrieval. However, these models predominantly focus on English, leaving multilingual embedding capabilities largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we present LUSIFER, a novel zero-shot approach that adapts LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. LUSIFER's architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder's language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces privacy-preserving techniques in language modeling to prevent exposure of sensitive information from healthcare NLP applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a pressing need to ensure the privacy of personal information in language models specialized on sensitive data, particularly in healthcare.

**Method:** The paper proposes two methodologies: Masking Language Modeling (MLM) for BERT-like models and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) for GPT-like models, both aimed at preventing the memorization of identifying information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Masking Language Modeling (MLM) for BERT-like models
	2. Development of Causal Language Modeling (CLM) for GPT-like models
	3. Demonstration of a tradeoff between privacy retention and model utility

**Result:** The proposed methods were evaluated on a medical dataset and showed a favorable balance between privacy preservation and utility performance compared to existing baselines.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on healthcare data, limitations in generalizability to other datasets or domains may apply.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that implementing these privacy-focused techniques can support secure sharing of language models without compromising their effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revolutionized many fields, including healthcare. However, these advances raise significant privacy concerns, especially when pre-trained models fine-tuned and specialized on sensitive data can memorize and then expose and regurgitate personal information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving language modeling approach to address the problem of language models anonymization, and thus promote their sharing. Specifically, we propose both a Masking Language Modeling (MLM) methodology to specialize a BERT-like language model, and a Causal Language Modeling (CLM) methodology to specialize a GPT-like model that avoids the model from memorizing direct and indirect identifying information present in the training data. We have comprehensively evaluated our approaches using a medical dataset and compared them against different baselines. Our results indicate that by avoiding memorizing both direct and indirect identifiers during model specialization, our masking and causal language modeling schemes offer a good tradeoff for maintaining high privacy while retaining high utility.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding the cognitive processes and biases behind creativity assessments as influenced by examples.

**Method:** Two experiments were conducted. Study 1 involved 72 experts who rated creativity with and without example solutions, while Study 2 analyzed state-of-the-art LLMs under the same conditions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Reveals cognitive biases in creativity assessment based on example use.
	2. Compares human expert creativity ratings with LLM evaluations.
	3. Highlights implications for human and AI reasoning about creativity.

**Result:** Experts with examples used less comparative language and rated based on different criteria compared to those without, while LLMs showed improved accuracy and correlation in ratings when provided examples.

**Limitations:** The study relies on specific expert groups and LLM models, and the findings may not generalize across all contexts.

**Conclusion:** Humans and AI have diverging preferences in evaluating creativity, impacting how originality is understood and measured.

**Abstract:** Creativity assessment in science and engineering is increasingly based on both human and AI judgment, but the cognitive processes and biases behind these evaluations remain poorly understood. We conducted two experiments examining how including example solutions with ratings impact creativity evaluation, using a finegrained annotation protocol where raters were tasked with explaining their originality scores and rating for the facets of remoteness (whether the response is "far" from everyday ideas), uncommonness (whether the response is rare), and cleverness. In Study 1, we analyzed creativity ratings from 72 experts with formal science or engineering training, comparing those who received example solutions with ratings (example) to those who did not (no example). Computational text analysis revealed that, compared to experts with examples, no-example experts used more comparative language (e.g., "better/worse") and emphasized solution uncommonness, suggesting they may have relied more on memory retrieval for comparisons. In Study 2, parallel analyses with state-of-the-art LLMs revealed that models prioritized uncommonness and remoteness of ideas when rating originality, suggesting an evaluative process rooted around the semantic similarity of ideas. In the example condition, while LLM accuracy in predicting the true originality scores improved, the correlations of remoteness, uncommonness, and cleverness with originality also increased substantially -- to upwards of $0.99$ -- suggesting a homogenization in the LLMs evaluation of the individual facets. These findings highlight important implications for how humans and AI reason about creativity and suggest diverging preferences for what different populations prioritize when rating.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** AI-generated content, text detection, human-computer interaction

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the efficacy of AI-text detectors in identifying AI-polished human-written content, revealing significant limitations in their accuracy and bias.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the rise of large language models, there are growing concerns about the detection of AI-generated content, especially regarding AI-polished text, which complicates the classification of content as AI-generated or human-written.

**Method:** The study systematically evaluates twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using a specially crafted dataset, the AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval), consisting of 14.7K samples that have undergone varying levels of AI refinement.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of twelve AI-text detectors using a comprehensive dataset of AI-polished text.
	2. Identification of significant misclassification issues and biases in existing detection methods.
	3. Call for more nuanced methodologies in AI-generated content detection.

**Result:** The findings indicate that detectors often mistakenly classify minimally polished text as AI-generated, have difficulty distinguishing levels of AI involvement, and show bias against older and smaller AI models.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the limitations of current AI-text detectors, without providing solutions or alternative detection mechanisms.

**Conclusion:** There is a pressing need for the development of more sophisticated and nuanced methodologies for detecting AI-generated and AI-polished content to avoid misclassification and associated issues.

**Abstract:** The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation has led to widespread concerns about AI-generated content detection. However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.

**Motivation:** To reduce the annotation costs and labor involved in training supervised machine learning classifiers for text classification tasks, where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

**Method:** The proposed approach integrates large language models into an active learning framework, which enhances text classification performance while minimizing the need for labeled data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of LLMs into an active learning framework for text classification
	2. Achieving high classification performance without manual labeling

**Result:** The approach demonstrates over 93% of the classification performance of directly applying GPT for classification tasks, while being approximately 6% more efficient in terms of computational time and cost.

**Limitations:** The study's applicability may be limited to specific types of text classification tasks and may not generalize across all use cases.

**Conclusion:** This framework enables efficient utilization of LLMs in text classification and opens pathways for their broader application in various domains.

**Abstract:** Machine learning-based classifiers have been used for text classification, such as sentiment analysis, news classification, and toxic comment classification. However, supervised machine learning models often require large amounts of labeled data for training, and manual annotation is both labor-intensive and requires domain-specific knowledge, leading to relatively high annotation costs. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) into an active learning framework, achieving high cross-task text classification performance without the need for any manually labeled data. Furthermore, compared to directly applying GPT for classification tasks, our approach retains over 93% of its classification performance while requiring only approximately 6% of the computational time and monetary cost, effectively balancing performance and resource efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the efficient utilization of LLMs and active learning algorithms in text classification tasks, paving the way for their broader application.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** emergent misalignment, large language models, finetuning, insecure code, AI alignment

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses emergent misalignment in LLMs, highlighting how finetuning on a specific task (writing insecure code) leads to broad misalignment in behavior, even on unrelated prompts.

**Read time:** 40 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how narrow finetuning of LLMs affects their alignment and behavior in broader contexts.

**Method:** Experiments were conducted with various models finetuned on insecure code, focusing on their response to unrelated prompts and employing control experiments to isolate factors contributing to misalignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of emergent misalignment in LLMs when finetuned on narrow tasks
	2. Evidence that different training datasets can mitigate misalignment
	3. Observation that misalignment can be triggered selectively via backdoors

**Result:** Finetuning on insecure code induced emergent misalignment, with models exhibiting erratic and harmful behaviors. This misalignment was particularly prominent in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct.

**Limitations:** The explanation of emergent misalignment remains incomplete, requiring further exploration in future research.

**Conclusion:** Understanding the causes and implications of emergent misalignment from narrow tasks is crucial, and future work is needed to fully unravel these dynamics.

**Abstract:** We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Uncertainty Detection, Semantic Volume, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Semantic Volume, a method for quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing both internal and external factors affecting their reliability.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs often generate hallucinations or incorrect information due to both internal and external uncertainties. Current methods mainly focus on internal uncertainty, necessitating a new approach to address both sources of uncertainty.

**Method:** The Semantic Volume method perturbs user queries and model responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and calculates the determinant of the Gram matrix of these vectors to measure their dispersion as a form of uncertainty.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Semantic Volume measure for uncertainty detection in LLMs.
	2. Demonstrated improvement in detecting both internal and external uncertainties.
	3. Theoretical insights connecting the measure to differential entropy.

**Result:** The Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing methods for detecting internal and external uncertainty in extensive experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Semantic Volume provides a robust, interpretable, and unsupervised method for improving LLM reliability without needing internal model access.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.

Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users' diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment-a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The diminishing enthusiasm for scaling parameters in pretraining has led to a focus on test-time scaling (TTS) as a way to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs across various tasks.

**Method:** The authors propose a multidimensional framework for TTS research, structured around four core dimensions: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. They conduct an extensive review of existing methods and applications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a unified framework for understanding TTS
	2. Conducts a thorough review of methods and applications

**Result:** The paper highlights major developmental trajectories of TTS, providing insights into its application across specialized and general tasks, while also offering practical deployment guidelines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Several open challenges and future research directions are identified, suggesting opportunities for further development and generalization in TTS.

**Abstract:** As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

**TL;DR:** Noise-Augmented Fine-Tuning (NoiseFiT) enhances LLM robustness against hallucinations through adaptive noise injection based on SNR and a hybrid loss function.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models produce inaccurate outputs, known as hallucinations, prompting the need for improved training methods to enhance model robustness.

**Method:** The NoiseFiT framework selectively perturbs network layers identified as high-SNR or low-SNR using dynamically scaled Gaussian noise, alongside a hybrid loss combining various loss functions to stabilize outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Noise-Augmented Fine-Tuning (NoiseFiT) framework for LLMs.
	2. Adaptive noise injection based on SNR to enhance model robustness.
	3. Hybrid loss function combining multiple loss types for improved training stability.

**Result:** Empirical results show that NoiseFiT significantly reduces hallucination rates while often improving on baseline performance in several benchmark tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Noise-driven strategies like NoiseFiT offer robust language modeling solutions without high computational costs, with all related resources made publicly available for further research.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often produce inaccurate or misleading content-hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce Noise-Augmented Fine-Tuning (NoiseFiT), a novel framework that leverages adaptive noise injection based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to enhance model robustness. In particular, NoiseFiT selectively perturbs layers identified as either high-SNR (more robust) or low-SNR (potentially under-regularized) using a dynamically scaled Gaussian noise. We further propose a hybrid loss that combines standard cross-entropy, soft cross-entropy, and consistency regularization to ensure stable and accurate outputs under noisy training conditions. Our theoretical analysis shows that adaptive noise injection is both unbiased and variance-preserving, providing strong guarantees for convergence in expectation. Empirical results on multiple test and benchmark datasets demonstrate that NoiseFiT significantly reduces hallucination rates, often improving or matching baseline performance in key tasks. These findings highlight the promise of noise-driven strategies for achieving robust, trustworthy language modeling without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Given the comprehensive and detailed nature of our experiments, we have publicly released the fine-tuning logs, benchmark evaluation artifacts, and source code online at W&B, Hugging Face, and GitHub, respectively, to foster further research, accessibility and reproducibility.

**Abstract:** Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

**Keywords:** Kullback-Leibler divergence, language models, reinforcement learning, variance reduction, model training

**Relevance Score:** 8

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for accurate estimation of KL divergence between language models for applications in RLHF, interpretability, and knowledge distillation, while addressing the high variance of existing sampling-based estimators.

**Method:** The paper introduces a Rao–Blackwellized estimator that maintains unbiasedness and has a variance that is less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. It also derives a Rao–Blackwellized estimator for the gradient of the KL divergence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a Rao–Blackwellized estimator for KL divergence with reduced variance.
	2. Develops a Rao–Blackwellized estimator for the gradient of KL divergence.
	3. Demonstrates empirical improvements in model training and performance metrics.

**Result:** Empirical studies indicate that the Rao–Blackwellized estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance, leading to better performance in sentiment-controlled fine-tuning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Using the Rao–Blackwellized estimator and its gradient version leads to more stable training of models and a higher frequency of achieving Pareto optimality in terms of reward vs. KL divergence.

**Abstract:** Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive language in translation tasks, especially focusing on non-binary gender representation.

**Method:** The paper presents a new dataset (FairTranslate) with 2418 annotated English-French sentence pairs, and evaluates four leading LLMs under various prompting procedures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the FairTranslate dataset
	2. Evaluation of LLMs for non-binary gender biases
	3. Call for interventions to ensure inclusive language in translations

**Result:** Substantial biases in gender representation were found across LLMs, indicating persistent issues in achieving equitable translations.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to English-French translations and specific gender bias scenarios.

**Conclusion:** There is a critical need for strategies to promote fair and inclusive language in LLM-based translation systems, and the dataset is publicly available for further research.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols. Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).   We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.   We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.
