  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Data visualization tasks require multi-step reasoning, but expert interpretive strategies are often not explicitly stated.

**Method:** ViStruct uses large language and vision-language models to identify chart components, map subtasks to chart regions, and present visual attention cues.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Automated simulation of expert reasoning workflows in data visualization.
	2. Integration of large language and vision-language models for enhanced interpretability.
	3. Evaluation across diverse chart types confirming expert alignment.

**Result:** The system was evaluated on 45 tasks across 12 chart types, validating its outputs with trained visualization users, confirming its ability to produce expert-aligned reasoning sequences.

**Limitations:** Not designed for novice instruction; focuses on expert-like reasoning flows.

**Conclusion:** ViStruct serves as a model of expert interpretation, potentially guiding the development of future visual literacy tools.

**Abstract:** Data visualization tasks often require multi-step reasoning, and the interpretive strategies experts use, such as decomposing complex goals into smaller subtasks and selectively attending to key chart regions are rarely made explicit. ViStruct is an automated pipeline that simulates these expert behaviours by breaking high-level visual questions into structured analytic steps and highlighting semantically relevant chart areas. Leveraging large language and vision-language models, ViStruct identifies chart components, maps subtasks to spatial regions, and presents visual attention cues to externalize expert-like reasoning flows. While not designed for direct novice instruction, ViStruct provides a replicable model of expert interpretation that can inform the development of future visual literacy tools. We evaluate the system on 45 tasks across 12 chart types and validate its outputs with trained visualization users, confirming its ability to produce interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning sequences.

We applied the validated feature selection and transformation approach in MySurgeryRisk models and redeveloped eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models for predicting risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation (MV) therapy and in-hospital mortality on a development set and evaluated the model performance on a validation set. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values were obtained for need for ICU admission, 0.93 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.93-0.93); need for MV, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.94-0.94); AKI, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.92-0.92); and in-hospital mortality, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.95). Area under the precision-recall curve values were computed for need for ICU admission, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.62-0.63); need for MV, 0.51 (95% CI, 0.49-0.52); AKI, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.53-0.54); and in-hospital mortality, 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29). The performance of these models is comparable to that of the previously validated MySurgeryRisk models, suggesting the enhanced generalizability of the models. Primary procedure code and provider specialty consistently appeared as the top influential variables, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing surgical outcomes.

*Jumanh Atoum, Jinkyung Park, Mamtaj Akter, Nicholas Kavoussi, Pamela Wisniewski, Jie Ying Wu*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** augmented reality, surgical training, eye-gaze tracking, endoscopic procedures, human-computer interaction

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of augmented reality (AR) for improving surgical training, focusing on an eye-gaze tracking system co-designed with surgical trainees.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The traditional apprenticeship model in surgical training is not scalable and limits the learning opportunities for trainees due to the need for patient care.

**Method:** The study involved working with 18 surgical trainees to identify their training needs and co-designing an AR-based eye-gaze tracking system based on their feedback.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. User-informed design of an AR eye-gaze tracking system for surgical training
	2. Identification of trainee needs and limitations in current training practices
	3. Guidelines for future development of AR training tools in surgery

**Result:** Trainees identified AR eye-gaze tracking as a valuable tool for enhancing their training while allowing them to prioritize patient care. They proposed features to improve tracking the attending surgeon's gaze.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings lead to user-informed guidelines for developing collaborative AR eye-gaze tracking systems that can enhance surgical training.

**Abstract:** The current apprenticeship model for surgical training requires a high level of supervision, which does not scale well to meet the growing need for more surgeons. Many endoscopic procedures are directly taught in the operating room (OR) while the attending surgeon and trainee operate on patients. The need to prioritize patient care limits the trainees' opportunities to experiment and receive feedback on their performance. Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to increase efficiency in endoscopic surgical training, but additional research is critical to understanding the needs of surgical trainees to inform the design of AR training systems. Therefore, we worked with 18 surgical trainees to understand the strengths, limitations, and unmet needs of their current training environment and to co-design an AR eye-gaze tracking system based on their preferences. Trainees emphasized the need to practice the 2D to 3D mapping needed to properly familiarize oneself with the anatomy of patients to prepare for real surgery. The trainees felt that an AR-based eye gaze tracking system would be a useful supplemental training method that would improve their learning in OR cases without detracting from patient care. To tailor the AR system to their needs, they co-designed features to improve their ability to track the attending surgeon's eye gaze and to provide a real-time, interactive system. Our results are valuable in shaping the endoscopic training modules by generating user-informed guidelines to design future collaborative AR-based eye-gaze tracking systems.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** hybrid collaboration, human-robot interaction, ambient awareness, workplace technology, remote participation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces NoticeLight, a robotic system designed to enhance hybrid meetings by providing ambient signals of remote participants' states, fostering equitable collaboration and addressing socio-technical asymmetries.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address socio-technical asymmetries in hybrid collaboration, which disadvantage remote participants, by leveraging robotic embodiments in meetings.

**Method:** NoticeLight uses ambient, physical signals like light patterns to represent remote participants' mood dynamics and attention cues, enhancing awareness without cognitive overload.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NoticeLight as a novel solution for hybrid meeting dynamics.
	2. Utilization of ambient signals to represent remote participant presence.
	3. Advancement of human-robot synergy by positioning robots as facilitators in collaborative settings.

**Result:** NoticeLight effectively fosters peripheral awareness and balanced participation in hybrid meetings, improving the dynamic collaboration experience for all participants.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of robotic systems like NoticeLight can significantly improve equity and engagement in hybrid work environments by mediating instead of replicating human presence.

**Abstract:** Hybrid collaboration has become a fixture in modern workplaces, yet it introduces persistent socio-technical asymmetries-especially disadvantaging remote participants, who struggle with presence disparity, reduced visibility, and limited non-verbal communication. Traditional solutions often seek to erase these asymmetries, but recent research suggests embracing them as productive design constraints. In this context, we introduce NoticeLight: a tangible, peripheral robotic embodiment designed to augment hybrid meetings. NoticeLight transforms remote participants' digital presence into ambient, physical signals -- such as mood dynamics, verbal contribution mosaics, and attention cues -- within the co-located space. By abstracting group states into subtle light patterns, NoticeLight fosters peripheral awareness and balanced participation without disrupting meeting flow or demanding cognitive overload. This approach aligns with emerging perspectives in human-robot synergy, positioning robots as mediators that reshape, rather than replicate, human presence. Our work thereby advances the discourse on how robotic embodiments can empower equitable, dynamic collaboration in the workplace.

Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly 47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions. Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms, and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and equity.

	3. Provision of resources to aid the implementation of the proposed framework.

**Result:** The proposed framework aims to improve the quality of evaluations for symptom checkers and includes open-access resources for practical implementation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adopting this standardized approach is expected to facilitate better evaluations, supporting meta-analyses and informed decision-making for stakeholders.

**Abstract:** Online and AI-based symptom checkers are applications that assist medical laypeople in diagnosing their symptoms and determining which course of action to take. When evaluating these tools, previous studies primarily used an approach introduced a decade ago that lacked any type of quality control. Numerous studies have criticized this approach, and several empirical studies have sought to improve specific aspects of evaluations. However, even after a decade, a high-quality methodological framework for standardizing the evaluation of symptom checkers remains missing. This article synthesizes empirical studies to outline a framework for standardized evaluations based on representative case selection, an externally and internally valid evaluation design, and metrics that increase cross-study comparability. This approach is backed up by several open-access resources to facilitate implementation. Ultimately, this approach should enhance the quality and comparability of future evaluations of online and AI-based symptom checkers to enable meta-analyses and help stakeholders make more informed decisions.

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the integration of AI-driven generative tools into game design and development, based on a user study with game designers, ultimately providing heuristics for better tool design.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how AI-driven generative tools can be effectively integrated into game design and development pipelines, addressing the lack of research and guidelines in this area.

**Method:** A user study was conducted with 16 game designers and developers to assess their behaviors and interactions with generative tools for creating graphical assets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of user preferences for generative tools in early design stages.
	2. Highlighting the need for better integration of generative tools in current development environments.
	3. Providing heuristics for designing generative tools tailored to game designers' needs.

**Result:** Findings indicate that participants prefer using generative tools in the early design stage to create multiple asset variations. They highlighted the need for better integration of these tools into existing workflows and for outputs to be easily manipulatable.

**Limitations:** The study limited its participant pool to 16 game designers and developers, which may not represent the broader community.

**Conclusion:** The research underscores the importance of understanding user needs for the effective incorporation of AI tools in game design, leading to the development of a set of heuristics for tool creation.

**Abstract:** Graphical assets play an important role in the design and development of games. There is potential in the use of AI-driven generative tools, to aid in creating graphical assets, thus improving game design and development pipelines. However, there is little research to address how the generative methods can fit into the wider pipeline. There also no guidelines or heuristics for creating such tools. To address this gap we conducted a user study with 16 game designers and developers to examine their behaviour and interaction with generative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design stage is preferred by all participants. Designers and developers are inclined to use such tools for creating large amounts of variations at the cost of quality as they can improve the quality of the artefacts once they generate a suitable asset. The results also strongly raised the need for better integration of such tools in existing design and development environments and the need for the outputs to be in common data formats, to be manipulatable and smoothly integrate into existing environments. The study also highlights the requirement for further emphasis on the needs of the users to incorporate these tools effectively in existing pipelines. Informed by these results, we provide a set of heuristics for creating tools that meet the expectations and needs of game designers and developers.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a finetuning framework for multilingual ASR using LoRA language experts to improve recognition performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the ineffectiveness of multilingual ASR models that struggle with language interference while maximizing model capacity across different languages.

**Method:** The authors propose a finetuning framework leveraging LoRA language experts and knowledge distillation for multilingual ASR based on Whisper.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a finetuning framework using LoRA language experts for ASR.
	2. Demonstration of improved performance in multilingual ASR settings.
	3. Application of knowledge distillation techniques for enhanced model efficiency.

**Result:** The models developed show approximately 10% and 15% relative performance gains in language-aware and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed finetuning approach significantly enhances the performance of multilingual ASR models compared to traditional methods.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that, multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

**Keywords:** Multimodal Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Multimodal Data, Knowledge Alignment

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents the Visual-Audio-Text Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), a new multimodal knowledge graph that supports visual, audio, and text information, enhancing the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing multimodal knowledge graphs are limited in scope and depth, restricting their relevance in recent advances in multimodal large language models that require extensive and up-to-date knowledge coverage.

**Method:** The authors propose a construction pipeline for the VAT-KG that ensures cross-modal knowledge alignment, enabling the automatic generation of knowledge graphs from any multimodal dataset, and introduce a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to retrieve concept-level knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first comprehensive multimodal knowledge graph covering visual, audio, and text data.
	2. Development of a robust construction pipeline for generating MMKGs from varied datasets.
	3. Implementation of a novel multimodal RAG framework for efficient knowledge retrieval.

**Result:** Experiments on various question answering tasks show that VAT-KG effectively supports MLLMs and excels in retrieving meaningful knowledge across multiple modalities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The VAT-KG significantly enhances the integration and utilization of multimodal knowledge, thus demonstrating its practical value in tasks requiring rich data from diverse sources.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information, where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities. Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rise of fake news poses challenges to information credibility, necessitating better detection methods that are both effective and understandable.

**Method:** The proposed Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection (DIFND) combines conditional diffusion models and multimodal large language models to generate and evaluate evidence against fake news.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Debunk-and-Infer framework for fake news detection

	3. Improvements in detection accuracy and interpretability in decision-making processes

**Result:** DIFND outperforms existing detection methods on FakeSV and FVC datasets, achieving significant improvements in detection accuracy and decision trustworthiness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integrated approach of DIFND not only enhances accuracy in fake news detection but also provides interpretable results through multimodal reasoning.

**Abstract:** The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded, multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers trustworthy decisions.

**TL;DR:** Introducing Bench To the Future (BTF), a pastcasting benchmark for evaluating LLM forecasting capabilities using known past events.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the need for a realistic framework to evaluate AI forecasting systems, highlighting the challenges in existing benchmarks.

**Method:** The authors present BTF, a pastcasting benchmark that includes hundreds of high-quality questions linked to a large offline corpus of relevant web pages, enabling the evaluation of LLMs on known past events.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a practical pastcasting benchmark for LLMs

	3. Providing a structured framework for evaluating forecasting on known events

**Result:** Results indicate that BTF facilitates forecasting results comparable to those obtained from active forecasting on unresolved questions, effectively tracking the capability of different LLMs over time.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** BTF is intended as a living benchmark that will evolve with new questions, allowing continuous improvement in evaluating LLM forecasting capabilities.

**Abstract:** Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts" on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own research.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Graph Language Models, Few-Shot Learning, Graph Neural Networks

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** GraphLAMA introduces an extra parameter adaptation stage for graph language models (GLMs) to improve prediction accuracy and inference speed using few labeled examples.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There are effectiveness and efficiency issues in in-context learning and instruction tuning for graph tasks, motivating the need for a new approach.

**Method:** GraphLAMA utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) to adapt parameters based on few-shot examples, enhancing GLM performance without requiring extensive labeled data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of GraphLAMA for enhanced GLM performance
	2. Efficient parameter adaptation using few-shot examples
	3. State-of-the-art results in node classification and summary generation.

**Result:** GraphLAMA outperforms existing methods with a 4.91% absolute improvement in accuracy and achieves inference speeds 10 times faster under a few-shot setting.

**Limitations:** Requires careful design of the GNN components and may not generalize across all graph domains.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method efficiently tailors GLMs for unseen tasks and graphs, demonstrating significant advancements in both accuracy and speed over traditional ICL methods.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL). Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network (GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times faster under 5-shot setting.

**Motivation:** To investigate how reinforcement learning fine-tuning techniques can enhance compact language models in performing complex tasks like instruction following and mathematical reasoning.

**Method:** Comparative analysis of supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) on a compact language model.

**Key Contributions:**

**Conclusion:** Combining fine-tuning approaches with inference-time tools can enhance the efficacy of lightweight language models, revealing practical strategies and trade-offs for model training.

**Abstract:** This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models. Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale language models.

**Keywords:** large language models, veracity detection, reasoning models, sycophantic tendencies, truth-bias

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the veracity detection capabilities of large language models (LLMs), comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models, and identifies concerning biases in accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the truth-judging capabilities of LLMs used in critical applications like fact-checking and decision-making.

**Method:** The study involved eight LLMs making 4,800 veracity judgments, comparing results from reasoning and non-reasoning models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Largest evaluation of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities.
	2. First analysis comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models.
	3. Identification of sycophantic tendencies impacting accuracy.

**Result:** Reasoning models showed lower rates of truth-bias than non-reasoning models but still performed worse than human benchmarks. Some models exhibited asymmetrical detection accuracy.

**Limitations:** The evaluation may not capture all aspects of LLM reasoning or contextual nuances in veracity detection.

**Conclusion:** Advancements in LLM capabilities do not fully address the challenges of veracity detection, highlighting the need for improved understanding and methods.

**Abstract:** Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** floor plan generation, next room prediction, architectural design, generative models, incremental workflows

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a 'next room prediction' model for architectural floor plan generation, addressing the limitations of existing end-to-end generative models by aligning with real-world iterative design workflows.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing generative models for floor plans often generate layouts in a single pass, which does not align with the iterative nature of architectural design.

**Method:** A novel 'next room prediction' mechanism inspired by autoregressive models, tailored for incremental floor plan generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a next room prediction paradigm for floor plan generation
	2. Demonstration of competitive performance against state-of-the-art models
	3. Alignment with real-world architectural design workflows.

**Result:** The proposed FPDS model shows competitive performance compared to existing methods such as diffusion models and Tell2Design in generating floor plans from text.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The FPDS model has potential applicability for supporting intelligent architectural design by aligning with the iterative processes used by architects.

**Abstract:** In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction' mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling. Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting future intelligent architectural design.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the performance gap of LLMs in low-resource and endangered languages, specifically Formosan languages, highlighting their sociolinguistic challenges.

**Method:** Evaluation of LLMs on machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and text summarization tasks using zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned learning settings with FORMOSANBENCH.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. FORMOSANBENCH benchmark introduced for low-resource languages
	2. Performance assessment of LLMs on endangered Formosan languages
	3. Release of datasets and code for future research

**Result:** Existing LLMs show significant performance gaps in comparison to high-resource languages, with limited improvements in performance from 10-shot learning and fine-tuning.

**Limitations:** Results may not generalize beyond the specific Formosan languages or tasks assessed.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the need for more inclusive NLP technologies, and datasets and code are released to support further research.

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered, largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in this direction.

**Motivation:** To explore traditional Japanese communication methods and apply them to enhance sentiment analysis through bias mitigation and explainability.

**Method:** The framework KCS+IBC integrates multiple large language models and includes a mid-phase casual dialogue session for blending predictions with individual insights, along with probabilistic sentiment forecasting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a multi-agent inference framework integrating multiple LLMs
	2. Introduction of a mid-phase casual dialogue session for predictions
	3. Demonstrates effectiveness in bias mitigation and explainability in sentiment analysis

**Result:** KCS achieves similar accuracy to a single LLM, while KCS+IBC reduces entropy and increases variance in predictions during later inference stages, indicating a balance between aggregation and diversity.

**Limitations:** The study currently lacks quantitative assessments of the framework's impact on bias correction and further applications.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework demonstrates potential for improved sentiment analysis and sets the stage for future research on bias correction and advanced analysis systems.

**Abstract:** Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the effectiveness of backtranslation in low resource machine translation, specifically from English to Gujarati, revealing that additional synthetic data may not always enhance performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the effectiveness of backtranslation in improving translation quality for low resource machine translation scenarios, particularly between English and Gujarati.

**Method:** The study involves training a multilingual pretrained MBART50 model on a baseline of 50,000 high-quality sentence pairs and augmenting this data with backtranslated examples from monolingual Gujarati text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of backtranslation in low-resource machine translation settings
	2. Analysis of its impact on English to Gujarati translation
	3. Evaluation using multiple metrics to assess model performance.

**Result:** Contrary to expectations, the addition of synthetic data from backtranslation does not lead to performance improvements and can even reduce translation quality.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on a specific language pair and type of synthetic data, limiting generalizability to other languages or translation methods.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that backtranslation may have diminishing returns in low-resource scenarios, emphasizing the need for further exploration in this area.

**Abstract:** Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000 sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

**Motivation:** To improve LLM performance in bioinformatics and Persian medical question answering, emphasizing the need for specialized datasets and evaluation methods.

**Method:** The study introduces the BIOPARS-BENCH dataset and the BioParsQA benchmark. It evaluates models like ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica for their abilities in knowledge acquisition, interpretation, and evidence demonstration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BioPars as an LLM application in Persian medical Q&A.
	2. Creation of BIOPARS-BENCH dataset from diverse scientific sources.
	3. Establishment of BioParsQA benchmark for evaluating LLMs in bioinformatics.

**Result:** BioPars outperformed competitors in various metrics such as ROUGE-L, BERTScore, MoverScore, and BLEURT, indicating a significant advancement in Persian medical Q&A applications.

**Limitations:** Shortcomings were noted in addressing complex, higher-level real-world questions and fine-grained inferences by the evaluated models.

**Conclusion:** The results highlight the effectiveness of BioPars in generating long answers and the necessity of fine-tuning LLMs for better performance in real-world bioinformatics tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers.

*Andrejs Sorstkins*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, RAG, HyDE, privacy-sensitive applications, personal assistant

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study assesses augmentation strategies for compact LLMs in edge applications, focusing on RAG and HyDE in a privacy-sensitive personal assistant context.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address resource efficiency challenges in deploying large language models in edge and privacy-sensitive applications.

**Method:** The study evaluates two augmentation strategies (RAG and HyDE) on Gemma LLMs of 1B and 4B parameters, utilizing MongoDB for short-term memory, Qdrant for long-term storage, and implemented with FastAPI and LangChain, featuring a React.js frontend.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of RAG and HyDE for compact LLMs in privacy-sensitive applications
	2. Implementation of a privacy-first personal assistant architecture
	3. Demonstration of the trade-offs between RAG and HyDE in terms of latency and relevance

**Result:** RAG reduces latency by up to 17% and eliminates factual hallucinations, while HyDE increases response time by 25–40% and introduces a non-negligible hallucination rate.

**Limitations:** HyDE's computational overhead and variability may hinder its practicality, especially for complex queries.

**Conclusion:** RAG is identified as the more effective and pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants using small-scale LLMs compared to HyDE.

**Abstract:** Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models (LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast, enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by small-scale LLMs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** SystemVerilog, natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation, large language models, NL2SVA

**Relevance Score:** 3

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a framework for automating the translation of natural language property descriptions into SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) using a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach and a fine-tuning dataset.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To automate the labor-intensive and error-prone process of translating natural language descriptions into SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs).

**Method:** The authors propose a customized RAG framework alongside a synthetic fine-tuning dataset with prompt-guided explanations for effective supervised fine-tuning, improving LLM performance in NL2SVA tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a customized RAG framework for NL2SVA
	2. Creation of a synthetic fine-tuning dataset with prompt-guided explanations
	3. Construction of the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA with detailed annotations

**Result:** The proposed RAG framework enhanced the performance of LLMs, increasing functionality-matched SVAs by 58.42% with GPT-4o-mini and achieving a 59.05% improvement with the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate significant enhancements in the accuracy of syntax and functionality when using LLMs for NL2SVA due to the combined use of the RAG framework and the specialized dataset.

**Abstract:** SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

**Motivation:** To analyze the transfer from language models to time series forecasting and identify effective design choices in low-data situations.

**Method:** The study evaluates various design decisions including upstream post-training, time series tokenization, and language model backbone size, assessing their impact on validation loss.

**Key Contributions:**

	2. Observation of non-vanishing transfer gaps in language models
	3. Insights into compute-efficient training methodologies for time series

**Result:** Significant findings indicate that design choices affect validation loss considerably, with observed smooth decreases in validation loss for LMs, suggesting a persistent transfer advantage over randomly initialized models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the findings not only provide insights into compute-efficient training for time series but also inspire further exploration of data distribution properties inherent to these models.

**Abstract:** Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language models to time series forecasting under various design choices including upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions leveraged by these models.

**Conclusion:** VIDEE effectively supports non-expert users in text analytics and provides insights for future intelligent text analytics systems.

**Abstract:** Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces CogTest, a benchmark for evaluating cognitive habits in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), revealing their human-like cognitive behaviors and their association with task adaptation and response safety.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To interpret and monitor LRM behaviors through the lens of human cognitive habits, providing a deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

**Method:** Introducing CogTest, which consists of 16 cognitive habits distilled into 25 tasks each, and using an evidence-first extraction method for reliable identification of these habits across various models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CogTest for benchmarking cognitive habits in LRMs.
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of 16 LLMs to reveal human-like cognitive behavior.
	3. Insights into the relationship between cognitive habits and harmful response generation.

**Result:** The study finds that LRMs mimic human cognitive habits and adjust these habits based on task requirements, revealing patterns that signify both similarities and differences in cognitive profiles among models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Analyzing cognitive habits in LRMs sheds light on their behavior patterns, particularly in relation to responding to safety-related tasks, suggesting a critical avenue for improving understanding of LLM operations.

**Abstract:** Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' -- consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits. CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks, and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study is motivated by inadequacies in existing MLLM benchmarks, which often lack structure and clarity in cognitive targets, resulting in overlapping abilities and limited diagnostic utility.

**Method:** The authors propose a framework based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to evaluate and restructure existing MLLM benchmarks, forming a capability hierarchy that categorizes MLLM abilities into Perception, Memory, and Reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the new benchmark and framework provide a more rigorous and clear approach to evaluating MLLMs, potentially improving future research in the field.

**Abstract:** Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity, dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development, dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception, Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive consistency compared to existing approaches.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of white-box and black-box models in optimizing instructions for LLMs, which often require extensive resources or incur high costs.

**Method:** The proposed framework merges black-box models for high-quality instruction initializations with white-box models for interpretability, utilizing a semantic similarity constraint to create a unified high-dimensional representation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a framework merging black-box and white-box models for LLM instruction optimization.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This fusion of approaches leads to a scalable and efficient solution for LLM applications in various real-world scenarios, with code to be released for further exploration.

**Abstract:** Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance structured reasoning capabilities of large language models on relational and graph-structured data by jointly optimizing multiple parsing tasks.

**Method:** The authors employ reinforcement learning combined with Chain-of-Thought supervision and introduce a topology-aware reward function based on graph edit distance to optimize parsing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a unified framework for structured reasoning on relational and graph data.
	2. Introduces a topology-aware reward function for better parsing optimization.
	3. Demonstrates significant performance improvements and zero-shot generalization on QA tasks.

**Result:** The largest model (QwQ-32B) demonstrates significant improvements in performance on semantic parsing tasks, specifically achieving a 13.5% increase on Spider and a 73.1% increase on Text2Cypher, alongside strong zero-shot generalization results on downstream QA tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** STRuCT-LLM showcases the potential of using executable queries as scaffolds for structured reasoning and the benefits of cross-formalism training between SQL and Cypher.

**Abstract:** We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models (LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA (CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

However, challenges such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning. Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks, respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR models with minimal computational overhead.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current evaluations of LLMs in healthcare are primarily physician-centric and English-focused, creating an illusion of competence.

**Method:** Introduction of HealthQA-BR, a benchmark consisting of 5,632 questions covering multiple healthcare professions, followed by zero-shot evaluation of 20 LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HealthQA-BR for evaluating LLMs in a multi-disciplinary context
	2. Demonstration of significant performance variations in healthcare knowledge among LLMs
	3. Provision of a tool aimed at improving the evaluation of AI readiness in healthcare.

**Result:** State-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 show high overall accuracy (86.6%), but performance varies greatly by specialty, with critical deficiencies in areas like Neurosurgery and Social Work.

**Limitations:** The benchmark currently focuses only on Portuguese-speaking healthcare, which may limit its applicability to other languages or regions.

**Conclusion:** HealthQA-BR and the evaluation suite highlight the need for comprehensive assessments beyond single-score metrics to ensure AI safety in healthcare teams.

**Abstract:** The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology, social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%), this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the entire healthcare team.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning. This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

**Keywords:** Human-Agent Collaboration, Text Analytics, Large Language Models

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** VIDEE is a system designed to aid entry-level analysts in performing advanced text analytics through a human-agent collaboration workflow, incorporating LLMs to enhance usability and effectiveness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To lower the barrier for entry-level analysts in text analytics, leveraging advances in LLMs to automate processes and improve accessibility.

**Method:** VIDEE uses a three-stage human-agent collaboration workflow: Decomposition (with a Monte-Carlo Tree Search for generative reasoning), Execution (to create a text analytics pipeline), and Evaluation (using LLM for result validation).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a collaborative workflow for text analytics
	2. Demonstration of usability for entry-level analysts
	3. Identification of user behavior patterns across experience levels

**Result:** Two quantitative experiments evaluated VIDEE's effectiveness, revealing usability across varied expertise levels and highlighting common agent errors.

**Limitations:** Limited to text analytics and may not generalize to other data analysis contexts.

**Conclusion:** VIDEE demonstrates practical utility for non-expert users in text analytics and suggests design implications for future intelligent text analytics systems.

**Abstract:** Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** hope speech, Natural Language Processing, Roman Urdu, dataset, transformer model

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** This study introduces a dataset and model for detecting hope speech in code-mixed Roman Urdu, addressing a gap in NLP for low-resource languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research addresses the gap in hope speech detection for underrepresented languages, particularly Roman Urdu, which is often overlooked in existing NLP studies.

**Method:** The study introduces an annotated dataset for hope speech in Roman Urdu and proposes a custom attention-based transformer model, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First multi-class annotated dataset for Roman Urdu hope speech
	2. Psychological analysis of hope speech patterns in Roman Urdu
	3. Development of an optimized attention-based transformer model

**Result:** The proposed model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of 0.78, surpassing baseline models SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76).

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to inclusive NLP by providing resources for hope speech detection in low-resource languages and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

**Abstract:** Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of 0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4% and 2.63% respectively.

**TL;DR:** Study shows small instruction-tuned model LLaMA 3 8B exhibits alignment faking, and prompt interventions can reduce this behavior.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate if smaller language models, like LLaMA 3 8B, can exhibit deceptive alignment seen in larger models and to explore the effectiveness of prompt-based interventions.

**Method:** Empirical study examining the behavior of LLaMA 3 8B under specific prompt interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First empirical evidence of alignment faking in small language models
	2. Introduction of a taxonomy distinguishing shallow and deep deception
	3. Significant effectiveness of prompt-based interventions in reducing deceptive alignment

**Result:** Prompt-only interventions significantly reduced alignment faking behavior in LLaMA 3 8B, indicating that smaller models can also exhibit deceptive behavior.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Alignment evaluations should be conducted across different model sizes, as even small models can show alignment faking, challenging prior assumptions about deceptive alignment being scale-dependent.

**Abstract:** Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates schema-constrained extraction of food product attributes from online pages using generative AI, focusing on LLM-based direct and indirect extraction methods.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To automate the extraction of structured information from food product pages on retail websites using LLMs, improving scalability and cost-effectiveness.

**Method:** Two LLM-based extraction approaches were compared: direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions. Their performances were evaluated based on accuracy, efficiency, and cost with a dataset of 3,000 food product pages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comparison of direct and indirect extraction methods using LLMs for food product information.
	2. Demonstrated the cost savings and efficiency of indirect extraction despite marginally lower accuracy.
	3. Provided insights into scalable automation for information extraction tasks.

**Result:** The indirect extraction approach achieved an accuracy of 96.48%, slightly lower than the direct method. However, it reduced the number of LLM calls by 95.82%, offering significant efficiency and cost benefits.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to food product pages and does not explore wider applications of the extraction methods.

**Conclusion:** Indirect extraction methods can serve as effective and scalable solutions for large-scale information extraction from template-based web pages using LLMs.

**Abstract:** Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%, $-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces MIME, a video-based benchmark to enhance vision-language models' understanding of nonverbal communication through mimed actions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding nonverbal communication is crucial for improving vision-language model capabilities, particularly in interpreting human gestures.

**Method:** The study presents MIME, a benchmark created from motion capture data comprising 86 mimed actions, evaluated on robustness against variations in character, background, and viewpoint.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MIME benchmark for evaluating mimed actions
	2. Demonstration of gaps between human performance and AI model capabilities
	3. Identification of the importance of understanding mimed actions for AI development

**Result:** Both open-weight and API-based vision-language models show significantly lower performance on the MIME benchmark compared to human interpretation of mimed actions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the necessity for further research to enhance the understanding of human gestures in AI, as current models do not meet human-level performance on the MIME dataset.

**Abstract:** Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC. Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust understanding of human gestures.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** DeepSeek, Public Opinion, Large Language Models, Cultural Bias, Demographic Bias

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the performance of the open-source LLM DeepSeek in simulating public opinions compared to other major LLMs, revealing its strengths and limitations across different social issues in the U.S. and China.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the comparative capabilities of DeepSeek, an open-source LLM, in predicting public opinions on social issues versus LLMs from major tech companies, focusing on cultural and demographic biases.

**Method:** The study compares DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 using survey data from the American National Election Studies and the Zuobiao dataset of China.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comparative evaluation of DeepSeek against major LLMs
	2. Insights into LLM performance on social issues in the U.S. and China
	3. Identification of biases in LLM responses across demographics

**Result:** DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other models in simulating U.S. opinions on abortion and performs well on foreign aid and individualism in China, but shows limitations on modeling low-income and non-college-educated views.

**Limitations:** DeepSeek-V3 shows limitations in capturing diverse perspectives among low-income and non-college-educated individuals, and all LLMs tend to overgeneralize within demographic groups.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the necessity of addressing cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling, advocating for inclusive training methodologies.

**Abstract:** This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling, calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Memorization, Transformer Circuits, Mechanistic Interpretability, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the mechanisms of memorization in large language models (LLMs) by examining transformer circuits that manage memorized and non-memorized content.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how LLMs memorize training data is crucial for improving their interpretability and addressing potential issues with data replication.

**Method:** The study employs mechanistic interpretability techniques, particularly examining transformer circuits to analyze the differences in model behavior when generating memorized versus non-memorized sentences using contrastive datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of transformer circuits responsible for memorization in LLMs
	2. Clarification of the roles of initiation and maintenance of memorization
	3. Discussion on the transferability of memorization prevention across domains

**Result:** The research identifies specific circuits within LLMs responsible for initiating and maintaining memorization, revealing that some circuits can initiate memorization while others can only maintain it without triggering it.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Memorization prevention mechanisms are effective across different text domains, but the induction of memorization is context-dependent, highlighting the complexity of LLM behavior.

**Abstract:** Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits -- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started, while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation. Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across different text domains, while memorization induction appears more context-dependent.

**TL;DR:** Introducing a general LLM detector (GLD) to effectively identify LLM-generated content across unseen models and domains.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated content, especially as LLMs proliferate and information spans diverse domains.

**Method:** The authors propose GLD, leveraging a twin memory networks design along with a theory-guided detection generalization module.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the general LLM detector (GLD)
	2. Utilization of twin memory networks for memory efficiency
	3. Development of detection generalization for unseen LLMs

**Result:** GLD demonstrated superior detection capabilities compared to existing state-of-the-art methods through empirical evaluations on real-world datasets.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of GLD in highly diverse or niche domains has yet to be thoroughly tested.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the need for effective detection methods for LLM-generated content, offering significant implications for digital platforms and the integrity of information.

**Abstract:** The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content. Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for digital platforms and LLMs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** test-time scaling, large language models, representation consistency, inference, coherent reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Representation Consistency (RC), a method for improving LLM performance at test time by effectively aggregating answers from multiple responses, enhancing inference without additional model queries.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing test-time scaling methods for LLMs often require complex modifications; our aim is to simplify this process and improve accuracy.

**Method:** RC aggregates answers from multiple candidate responses by evaluating both answer frequency and the consistency of model activations during generation, using only cached data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a new test-time scaling method called Representation Consistency (RC).
	2. Validates the effectiveness of RC on multiple LLMs and reasoning datasets.
	3. Shows that sparse activation consistency correlates with coherent reasoning.

**Result:** Experiments show RC improves task performance during inference, with up to 4% accuracy increases over traditional test-time scaling methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RC offers a novel and efficient way to enhance LLM performance by leveraging representation consistency without needing extra queries.

**Abstract:** Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.

**TL;DR:** A new evaluation framework, FinEval-KR, is proposed to assess Large Language Models' financial reasoning abilities, introducing distinct scoring metrics and a new dataset for research.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate LLMs in financial reasoning by failing to separate knowledge and reasoning capabilities and lacking root cause analysis for their failures.

**Method:** The paper introduces the FinEval-KR framework, which includes knowledge and reasoning scores, alongside a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy. It also presents an open-source dataset for Chinese financial reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FinEval-KR framework for evaluating financial reasoning in LLMs
	2. Distinct scoring metrics: knowledge score, reasoning score, and cognitive score
	3. Release of a new open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that reasoning ability and higher-order cognitive ability are critical for reasoning accuracy, highlighting that even leading models encounter issues with knowledge application.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by its focus on financial reasoning and may not be indicative of LLM performance across other domains.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that specialized financial LLMs generally perform worse than top general models in various metrics, pointing to persistent limitations in knowledge application.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning. Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome communication barriers for individuals with hearing impairments and improve the efficiency and accuracy of sign language recognition methods.

**Method:** The approach utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture based on BART to encode x and y coordinates of skeleton sequences independently, while using Cross-Attention to maintain their interrelation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel SLR approach using BART architecture
	2. Independent encoding of x and y coordinates from skeleton sequences
	3. Outstanding accuracy with fewer parameters compared to previous models

**Result:** The model achieves 96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset with only 749,888 parameters, outperforming previous models. It also shows strong performance on WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This study offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of hearing.

**Abstract:** Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves 96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of hearing.

**Abstract:** We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent, step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.

**Motivation:** Despite advances in large language models, document understanding remains a challenge, necessitating exploration of how input format impacts comprehension.

**Method:** The authors propose a novel approach using LaTex for encoding document elements, preserving hierarchical and spatial structures, and conduct attention analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a structure-preserving encoding approach using LaTex
	2. Demonstration of improved document comprehension performance in MLLMs
	3. Insights into attention patterns driven by structured text

**Result:** The new approach enhances MLLM performance in document question answering by inducing structured attention patterns, improving focus on semantically meaningful content, and reducing attention waste.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Structure-preserving formats significantly improve MLLMs' ability to comprehend documents effectively without requiring changes to model architecture or additional training.

**Abstract:** Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content, directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question answering performance across diverse document types without requiring architectural modifications or additional training.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** BiMark addresses critical trade-offs in watermarking for LLMs, providing a practical solution for the authenticity challenge in generated text.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge, we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To propose a new conceptualization of LLMs beyond their autonomous intelligence or programmed mimicry, viewing them as cultural repositories.

**Method:** Analysis of four features: compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion in the context of LLMs and human culture.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel conceptualization of LLMs as cultural repositories
	2. Framework for understanding LLMs' impact on human creativity
	3. Comparison between LLMs and DNA in preserving cultural dynamics

**Result:** Demonstrates that LLMs serve as compressed patterns of human expression that require human reinterpretation to hold meaning, facilitating creative processes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLMs are proposed as tools for self-reflection and hypothesis generation, contributing to cultural evolvability without competing with human intelligence.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs) as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience. Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics and norms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a modular framework for knowledge graph construction from legal texts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By providing cleaner knowledge graphs, CORE-KG enhances the analysis of complex criminal networks, making it a valuable tool in legal informatics.

**Abstract:** Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations, and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG, a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential, structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into computational efficiency versus reasoning robustness, with recommendations for improving model design and evaluation.

**Abstract:** Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models (LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However, existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model design and evaluation in practical applications.

**Motivation:** The study addresses the unclear conditions under which multimodal integration improves forecasting accuracy, specifically when incorporating text with time series data.

**Method:** The authors systematically evaluate two multimodal forecasting approaches—aligning-based and prompting-based methods—across 14 tasks in 7 domains, analyzing model architecture and data characteristics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic evaluation of multimodal forecasting methods across diverse domains
	2. Identification of key conditions for effective integration of text in time series forecasting
	3. Practical guidelines for forecasting tasks based on empirical findings

**Result:** The findings indicate that multimodal methods do not consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with effectiveness influenced by model capacity, data availability, and the relevance of the text data.

**Limitations:** The findings may not generalize to all forecasting tasks and datasets, as the study is limited to the selected benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** The empirical results provide guidelines for effectively leveraging multimodal data in forecasting, emphasizing the conditions under which textual information is beneficial.

**Abstract:** Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

**Motivation:** To improve POI embedding methodologies facing challenges in multi-context sampling, versatility, and generalization.

**Method:** The AdaptGOT model employs contextual neighborhood generation through advanced sampling techniques, a GOT representation with attention mechanisms, and a MoE-based encoder-decoder architecture.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of contextual neighborhood generation techniques
	2. Integration of attention mechanisms for GOT representation

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate superior performance of AdaptGOT over existing models across multiple POI tasks using real-world datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AdaptGOT effectively addresses existing challenges in POI embeddings, providing better representation and generalization in multi-context scenarios.

**Abstract:** Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI) embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific, end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation, which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based, importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

**Conclusion:** LastingBench provides a scalable solution to ensure the integrity and robustness of benchmark evaluations, promoting fair assessments of LLM capabilities.

**Abstract:** The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

**TL;DR:** GARMLE-G is a framework that integrates medical language model outputs with clinical practice guidelines to enhance diagnosis accuracy and relevance.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of current medical language models that rely on ICD codes, which do not reflect the nuanced reasoning used by clinicians for diagnosis.

**Method:** GARMLE-G combines LLM predictions with EHR data to create rich queries, retrieves snippets from clinical practice guidelines, and generates recommendations that are aligned with clinical guidelines.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a framework that grounds LLM outputs in clinical practice guidelines
	2. Demonstrates a significant improvement in precision and relevance over traditional methods
	3. Maintains a lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment

**Result:** A prototype system for hypertension diagnosis demonstrated superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and adherence to clinical guidelines compared to traditional approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GARMLE-G offers a scalable, low-cost method for grounding medical language models in evidence-based practices, showing promise for broader clinical applications.

**Abstract:** Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs), typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records (EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis. Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics, demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong potential for broader clinical deployment.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces TIM, a large model for open-domain Timeline Summarization, aimed at improving topic relevance and evolution assessment in news summaries.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing LLMs struggle with assessing the relevance of news topics and understanding their evolution, leading to poor summarization outcomes.

**Method:** A new Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM) is proposed, supported by a large-scale dataset of over 1,000 news topics and 3,000 annotated instances. It uses a progressive optimization strategy with instruction tuning and a dual-alignment reward learning method.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the large-scale TLS dataset
	2. Development of the Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM)
	3. Implementation of a progressive optimization strategy with novel reward learning

**Result:** TIM effectively summarizes open-domain timelines, demonstrating improved performance in filtering irrelevant information and understanding topic evolution.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Experimental results validate the robustness of TIM in open-domain summarization tasks.

**Abstract:** Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000 annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

**Read time:** 5 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Enhancing text-to-speech systems to achieve better duration control and emotional expression for applications requiring audio-visual synchronization.

**Method:** Introduction of IndexTTS2, supporting two generation modes: explicit token number specification for duration control and free generation while maintaining prosody. Incorporates GPT latent representations for better speech stability and a soft instruction mechanism for emotion guidance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel method for speech duration control in autoregressive models
	2. Disentanglement of emotional expression and speaker identity
	3. Incorporation of GPT latent representations for improved speech stability

**Result:** IndexTTS2 outperforms existing zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods in IndexTTS2 significantly improve TTS systems, allowing for better emotional expression and duration control, suitable for applications like video dubbing.

**Abstract:** Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input. Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the effectiveness of LLMs in generating user-like comments in politically charged online discussions and their potential implications for discourse manipulation.

**Method:** Three experiments were conducted in which GPT-4 generated comments impersonating real or artificial partisan users, analyzing outputs against actual user comments and a null model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of LLMs in a divisive political context
	2. Comparison of generated comments to real user contributions
	3. Insight into AI's role in political discourse manipulation

**Result:** GPT-4 produced realistic comments reflecting community support for candidates but created more consensus than dissent; distinguishing real and artificial comments in a semantically derived space was successful, but they were indistinguishable manually.

**Limitations:** Focuses on a specific time frame (2016 US Presidential election) and platform (Reddit), which may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** LLMs like GPT-4 can effectively simulate online discussions but their potential to influence political narrative requires careful consideration.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario: Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular, we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments, both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions, influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

**Abstract:** In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over 5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof correctness.

**Abstract:** Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research. However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in leveraging structural information for improving language model representations through a new probing framework.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine how well different models utilize structural information in natural language processing tasks and to investigate the potential advantages of MLPs over GNNs in this context.

**Method:** The paper introduces a probing framework informed by information theory to systematically assess explicit structural modeling's role in enhancing language model representations. It involves modular probing classifiers controlling the use of GNN components versus MLPs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a new probing framework for evaluating structural modeling in language models.
	2. Demonstrated superior performance of MLPs in capturing linguistic knowledge compared to traditional GNNs.
	3. Clarified the roles of message-passing and feature-transformation in model performance.
	4. Used the Edge Probing Suite for comprehensive evaluation.

**Result:** MLPs, serving as feature transformation modules, consistently enhance linguistic knowledge in language model representations. GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation operations also show improvements, while those relying solely on message-passing operations perform poorly.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that MLPs can be effective alternatives to GNNs in structural-aware NLP tasks when appropriately utilized, highlighting the importance of feature transformation over just message-passing.

**Abstract:** Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks. Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations, avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules, consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative impacts on probing task performance.

The dataset predominantly features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance. Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

**Abstract:** In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker information.

**Keywords:** fact verification, large language models, bias, Llama 3.1, evidence retrieval

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores how biases in large language models impact the outcomes of fact verification systems, specifically analyzing Llama 3.1's performance in the HerO system.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The investigation seeks to understand the influence of parametric knowledge biases in LLMs on fact-checking effectiveness, particularly for the HerO system under the FEVER-25 benchmark.

**Method:** Experiments were conducted with Llama 3.1 to assess its bias in factual claims, examining how the model's prompts influenced the generation of supporting, refuting, or neutral documents for fact verification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of relational bias in LLMs for fact checking.
	2. Analysis of the impact of prompting on evidence retrieval in fact verification.
	3. Contribution of code resources for the research community.

**Result:** Llama 3.1 identified nearly half of the claims as 'Not Enough Evidence' and showed that different prompting strategies resulted in about 50% unique evidence retrievals tied to the perspective taken, although verdict stability was maintained across methods.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the HerO system utilizing Llama 3.1 and may not generalize to other models or systems.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight that Llama 3.1 exhibits inherent negative bias by sometimes refusing to produce evidence for claims deemed false, indicating the importance of understanding LLM biases in fact verification tasks.

**Abstract:** Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment, we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective. Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability across prompting strategies. The code is available at: https://github.com/eibakke/FEVER-8-Shared-Task

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the TLQA benchmark for evaluating temporal understanding and list construction in Large Language Models.

**Read time:** 11 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of extensive evaluation on the temporal understanding capabilities of LLMs, especially in list answer construction tasks involving time intervals and multiple entities.

**Method:** The authors propose the Time referenced List based Question Answering (TLQA) benchmark, which requires LLMs to construct answers in list format while accurately associating entities with specified time periods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the TLQA benchmark for temporal understanding in list format.
	2. Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on the TLQA benchmark.
	3. Insights on the limitations of current models in closed-book and open-domain scenarios.

**Result:** Current state-of-the-art generative models show significant shortcomings in providing complete answers and ensuring temporal alignment in closed-book setups, highlighting the need for improvements in both closed-book and open-domain settings.

**Limitations:** The benchmark's performance evaluation is limited to existing state-of-the-art models and may not encompass all potential advancements in LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate clear avenues for future research on enhancing temporal understanding and list construction in LLMs, as well as the introduction of TLQA as a valuable benchmark.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds. Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark, requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks. We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models, particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of detecting offensive language in user-generated content on social media, where manual moderation is impractical due to the volume of data.

**Method:** The study proposes an automatic offensive language detection model using XLNet and compares it with BERT, utilizing the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID) for evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an XLNet-based model for offensive language detection
	2. Comparison of XLNet and BERT performance on the OLID dataset
	3. Evaluation of oversampling and undersampling strategies for class imbalance

**Result:** Experimental results show that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting and categorizing offensive content, while BERT performs slightly better at identifying targets. Oversampling and undersampling strategies also improved performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest the efficacy of transfer learning and XLNet in developing robust systems for automatic offensive language detection on social media.

**Abstract:** The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats, comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

**Conclusion:** The paper aims to guide research efforts toward developing more transparent and responsible LLMs through a systematic understanding of explainability techniques.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box' and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications. Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing transparent and responsible LLMs.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Scientific English, Linguistic Changes, Semantic Shifts, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the recent linguistic changes in Scientific English, particularly focusing on the rise of specific words influenced by Large Language Models like ChatGPT, and how these changes reflect broader semantic and pragmatic qualifications rather than just frequency spikes.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of Large Language Models on the evolution of Scientific English and the nature of recent linguistic changes.

**Method:** The study systematically analyzes frequency trends of 'spiking words' in scientific abstracts from PubMed, including part of speech tagging to quantify shifts across grammatical categories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of recent changes in scientific English influenced by LLMs
	2. Systematic tracking of semantic shifts and their implications
	3. Examination of declining lexical items alongside spiking words

**Result:** Significant changes in word frequency patterns were identified, with entire semantic clusters shifting together, indicating that the influence of Large Language Models is semantic and pragmatic rather than purely lexical.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into how language technology shapes human language, highlighting complex interactions between lexical changes and organic language evolution.

**Abstract:** Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear. The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial" replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential" as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important" shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology continues to shape human language.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach shows promise for improved authorship attribution and opens avenues for further research in multilingual author attribution and generative modeling.

**Abstract:** The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67 prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation, revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general computational literature research. This research will facilitate further research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative modeling of Persian poetry.

This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89 percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by 3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for high-performing text classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Establishing trust in LLM outputs is critical for real-world applications, necessitating better uncertainty quantification techniques.

**Method:** The paper formalizes the consistency hypothesis and introduces mathematical statements with statistical tests to evaluate LLM output conformity across various tasks, focusing specifically on three: question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Formalization of the consistency hypothesis for LLM outputs
	2. Introduction of new statistical tests for uncertainty quantification
	3. Development of data-free UQ methods leveraging output similarity

**Result:** Empirical testing across 8 benchmark datasets indicates that the consistency hypothesis frequently holds, with the 'Sim-Any' hypothesis identified as the most effective for developing data-free UQ methods that outperform existing baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The consistency hypothesis empirically supports the development of novel UQ techniques that can effectively estimate LLM output confidence while requiring no additional data.

**Abstract:** Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis. We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL), highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation. These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand how neural language models, specifically BERT, encode and construct syntactic structures across layers.

**Method:** Derivational Probing is proposed to explore the emergence of micro-syntactic structures in lower layers and their integration into macro-syntactic structures in higher layers during word embedding propagation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Derivational Probing as a methodology for analyzing syntactic structure in neural networks.
	2. Evidence of a clear bottom-up derivation of syntactic structures in BERT.
	3. Insights into the timing of macro-syntactic structure construction and its impact on model performance.

**Result:** The study found that micro-syntactic structures emerge in the lower layers and are progressively incorporated into a global macro-syntactic structure in the upper layers. Additionally, macro-syntactic structures are crucial for downstream performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The timing of constructing macro-syntactic structures critically influences the model's performance, suggesting the need for optimal timing in integrating global syntactic information.

**Abstract:** Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g., the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing for integrating global syntactic information.

**Keywords:** multimodal, large language models, speech generation, adaptive learning, Mixture of Experts

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** DeepTalk is a framework that enhances native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by improving their ability to generate speech and text, while reducing performance degradation typically experienced due to insufficient paired speech-text data.

**Read time:** 7 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Native multimodal large language models suffer from performance issues caused by insufficient paired speech-text data, leading to catastrophic forgetting and significant performance drops compared to traditional text-based models.

**Method:** The DeepTalk framework utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to adaptively identify modality experts based on their modality load and employs specialized single-modality training followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DeepTalk framework for modality expert learning
	2. Significantly lower performance degradation in multimodal tasks
	3. Maintained low response latency for speech interactions

**Result:** DeepTalk achieves a mere 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, significantly better than the over 20% drop typically observed in native MLLMs like GLM-4-Voice, while maintaining end-to-end dialogue latency under 0.5 seconds.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of DeepTalk may still be limited by the quality and quantity of available paired speech-text data.

**Conclusion:** DeepTalk offers a solution to improve the training and performance of native multimodal LLMs, ensuring better speech interaction experiences with reduced latency.

**Abstract:** Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience. Code and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.

We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios, introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios. The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment under various speech-specific scenarios.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the world modeling capabilities of recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using a new framework and benchmark called WM-ABench, finding notable limitations in their abilities.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To systematically assess the world modeling abilities of Vision-Language Models as prior studies have shown limitations in specific capabilities without a comprehensive evaluation framework.

**Method:** The authors propose a two-stage framework evaluating Perception (covering various dimensions like visual and spatial understanding) and Prediction (including mechanistic and compositional inference). They introduce WM-ABench comprising 23 evaluation dimensions and conduct 660 experiments on 15 VLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating VLMs as world models
	2. Introduction of WM-ABench benchmark with 23 evaluation dimensions
	3. Identification of significant limitations in VLMs' world modeling abilities through extensive testing.

**Result:** The evaluation revealed that VLMs showed near-random accuracy in tasks like distinguishing motion trajectories and demonstrated a lack of disentangled understanding in certain scenarios, indicating significant gaps compared to human capabilities.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on a limited set of VLMs and scenarios, which may not encompass all possible capabilities and use cases.

**Conclusion:** The findings signify that while VLMs are advanced in certain respects, they possess fundamental limitations in world modeling abilities, which could impact their application in human-computer interaction and other domains.

**Abstract:** Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning. Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660 experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding -- e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones. More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and human-level world modeling.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, model bias, inference bias, multilingual evaluation, cultural context

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper evaluates biases in large language models (LLMs) through a two-phase assessment focusing on factual and disputable scenarios, utilizing a dataset across multiple languages.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding LLMs' behavior in diverse contexts is crucial as their outputs can influence public opinion and reinforce narratives.

**Method:** Two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assesses consistency in factual answers across languages, while Phase 2 explores responses to geopolitically sensitive disputes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition of model bias and inference bias
	2. Development of a multilingual dataset for evaluating LLMs
	3. Insights into LLM behavior in factual versus disputable contexts

**Result:** Phase 1 shows alignment induced by query language; Phase 2 indicates an interaction between model training context and query language.

**Limitations:** The study may not account for all cultural or linguistic nuances across languages.

**Conclusion:** The study provides a framework for examining LLM behavior in neutral and sensitive contexts, aiding culturally aware evaluation practices.

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment, while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores leveraging checkpoint models during language model training to improve data mixture quality and task capabilities by identifying their influence throughout the training process.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance language model training by utilizing checkpoint models, which exhibit emerging capabilities at different training stages, as under-utilized sources of data signals.

**Method:** The authors identify checkpoint models according to their capabilities on various benchmarks and employ them as data mixers by approximating their first-order influence over source data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of checkpoint models based on capabilities during training.
	2. Introduction of a method to utilize these checkpoints as data mixers.
	3. Empirical demonstration of performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks.

**Result:** The proposed framework was evaluated on eight reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in the pretraining setting, with performance gains of up to 1.93%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings illustrate the potential of using checkpoint models to optimize data mixtures and enhance the overall quality of training data in language models.

**Abstract:** In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory. Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data mixtures.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents PapersPlease, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' biases in decision-making using moral dilemmas related to immigration.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine LLMs' behaviors in role-playing contexts and assess their biases through decision-making scenarios involving human needs.

**Method:** A benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas where LLMs act as immigration inspectors, making decisions based on narratives structured by ERG theory.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the PapersPlease benchmark with 3,700 scenarios.
	2. Demonstrating that LLMs display implicit biases based on identity.
	3. Providing publicly available data for further research.

**Result:** Analysis of six LLMs reveals significant decision-making patterns and implicit preferences; models showed varying responses to social identities in narratives, affecting denial rates for marginalized groups.

**Limitations:** Study limited to six LLMs; further exploration needed across more diverse models and contexts.

**Conclusion:** LLMs encode preferences linked to motivational needs and social identities, indicating a need for careful evaluation of AI biases in applied contexts.

**Abstract:** Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory, which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making, suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** LLM agents, tool invocation, error vulnerability, model stability, evaluation

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM agents to errors throughout the tool invocation process and highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current evaluations of LLM agents focus on tool usage but neglect their stability, leading to potential real-world issues.

**Method:** The research conducts extensive experiments to assess the error susceptibility of agents during the entire tool invocation process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified error vulnerability stages in LLM agents' tool invocation process
	2. Demonstrated higher susceptibility of open-source models compared to proprietary ones
	3. Established the need for agent stability evaluation in LLM development

**Result:** Agents were found to be highly susceptible to errors at every stage of tool invocation, with open-source models being more vulnerable than proprietary ones.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Evaluating agent stability is crucial for LLM development, as larger models do not necessarily improve stability and may increase vulnerability to attacks.

**Abstract:** Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation.

**Keywords:** Pre-Trained Language Models, Large Language Models, Jailbreak Attacks, Token-Level Attacks, Prompt-Level Attacks

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper presents hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to improve jailbreak effectiveness of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on PTLMs and LLMs, addressing the vulnerabilities in current safety measures.

**Method:** The authors propose two hybrid approaches, GCG + PAIR and GCG + WordGame, which combine token-level and prompt-level attack strategies. These were tested on Vicuna and Llama models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of hybrid attack methods combining token- and prompt-level techniques.
	2. Demonstrated significantly higher attack success rates on various models.
	3. Highlighted previously unreported vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms.

**Result:** GCG + PAIR achieved a 91.6% attack success rate on Llama-3, a significant increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. GCG + WordGame maintained over 80% success even against stringent defenses.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Hybrid attack strategies expose vulnerabilities in existing safety mechanisms and underscore the need for improved defenses against evolving threats.

**Abstract:** The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications. Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks. Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a formal framework for simulating social network user behavior using LLMs, testing communication imitation on social networks in English and German, and advocating for more rigorous applications of generative-agent-based modeling.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address conflicting research findings regarding the ability of LLMs to replicate human behavior in empirical studies, specifically within social networks.

**Method:** The authors provide a formal framework for social network simulations and conduct empirical tests on LLMs to imitate user communication behaviors on the social media platform X in two languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Formal framework for simulating social network user behavior using LLMs
	2. Empirical testing of communication imitation in multiple languages
	3. Establishment of a need for validation of social simulations based on empirical realism.

**Result:** The study finds that the empirical realism of social simulations is crucial and should be validated based on the experimental setting corresponding to the simulation components.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to specific platforms and languages, which may not generalize to all social networks.

**Conclusion:** The paper emphasizes the importance of rigor in applying generative-agent-based modeling for accurate social simulation and understanding user behavior.

**Abstract:** The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds, there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted. With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper enhances the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations using fine-tuning methods and normalization techniques on Whisper ASR models, achieving significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER).

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the poor performance of ASR models in niche domains, specifically in accurately transcribing cockpit conversations that include specialized vocabulary and multilingual dialogue.

**Method:** The authors collected and manually labeled around 215 minutes of cockpit simulator and pilot interview recordings. They implemented multiple normalization schemes and fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to improve the Whisper model's ASR performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of normalization schemes for ASR in niche domains
	2. Successful application of fine-tuning with LoRA on ASR models
	3. Demonstration of significant improvement in WER for cockpit dialogues

**Result:** The proposed methods reduced the Word Error Rate (WER) from 68.49% to 26.26% on the finetuned Whisper Large model using normalization schemes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The normalization and fine-tuning approach significantly improves ASR transcription accuracy in specialized contexts, making it more effective for cockpit conversations.

**Abstract:** The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85 minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance, utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the proposed normalization scheme).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the performance of machine translations in children's literature compared to human translations from a stylometric perspective.

**Method:** Constructed a corpus of 21 translations (7 HTs, 7 LLMs, 7 NMTs) and analyzed using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, focusing on generic and creative text translation features.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Constructed a unique Peter Pan translation corpus for analysis.
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs over NMTs in creative text translation.
	3. Identified significant differences in stylistic features among HTs and MTs.

**Result:** Significant differences found in word distributions and descriptive word usage among HTs, LLMs, and NMTs. LLMs outperformed NMTs in CTT-specific features and aligned more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics.

**Limitations:** Limited to a single work of children's literature (Peter Pan) and focused on specific stylistic features.

**Conclusion:** LLMs demonstrate potential in children's literature translation by exhibiting similarities to human translation styles.

**Abstract:** This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations (MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations (HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set (including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm, translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in total.   Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios. Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in CLT.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the linguistic peculiarities of machine translation outputs, specifically in the context of the English-to-Chinese language pair, which has been less studied.

**Method:** A large dataset was constructed comprising four sub-corpora, and a five-layer feature set was employed. Chi-square ranking was used for feature selection in classification and clustering tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of linguistic patterns in machine translation outputs.
	2. Establishment of classification accuracy metrics for NMT and LLM outputs.
	3. Comparison of lexical diversity between NMTs and LLMs regarding translation outputs.

**Result:** The study confirmed the presence of MTese in both NMT and LLM, with original texts distinguishable from outputs. LLM showed greater lexical diversity, while NMT had more brackets in the outputs.

**Limitations:** Focused solely on English-to-Chinese news texts; other language pairs may exhibit different characteristics.

**Conclusion:** Translation-specific LLMs had lower lexical diversity but used more causal conjunctions compared to generic LLMs. No significant differences were found between domestic and international LLMs.

**Abstract:** This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70% classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

**Motivation:** To explore the under-researched self-correction abilities of LLMs during complex reasoning tasks and address issues arising from redundancy in reasoning and errors in initial steps.

**Method:** Empirical analysis of reasoning errors across two open-source model families (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) and development of an efficient sampling strategy using a reward model to optimize first reasoning steps.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified significant impact of first reasoning step on overall model performance.
	2. Proposed a sampling strategy that improves self-correction capacity and minimizes inference costs.
	3. Established a new benchmark for evaluating model reasoning capabilities. 

**Result:** The proposed sampling strategy achieved a 70% reduction in inference costs while maintaining accuracy, highlighting the importance of the first reasoning step in the reasoning chain.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A new benchmark was introduced for assessing self-correction in LLMs, facilitating further research on improving reasoning robustness.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Technological advancements have profoundly transformed communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics: COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes, including variations in language complexity between individuals and organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores. Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social structures in online spaces.

### [104] [Identifying a Circuit for Verb Conjugation in GPT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22105)

*David Demitri Africa*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** GPT-2, subject-verb agreement, circuit discovery, neural networks, language modeling

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper examines the sub-network responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2, isolating a candidate circuit that aids verb conjugation accuracy.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand how GPT-2 processes subject-verb agreement and to isolate the corresponding neural circuitry.

**Method:** The study uses prompts with singular and plural subjects to analyze verb form predictions, employing techniques like performance verification and direct logit attribution for circuit discovery.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Isolation of the sub-network responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2
	2. Application of performance verification and circuit discovery techniques
	3. Insights into model efficiency regarding task complexity

**Result:** Isolated a candidate circuit that significantly contributes to correct verb conjugation; it was found that only a small fraction of the network's pairs achieve near-model performance in base tasks, with more required for complex settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the efficiency of certain sub-networks in achieving language tasks and the potential complexity of others in enhanced contexts.

**Abstract:** I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or "circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g. "Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

**Conclusion:** DAPFAM provides a scalable and comprehensive resource for patent retrieval research, addressing existing limitations in dataset design.

**Abstract:** In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level. The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336 full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments (forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional, requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now the access link is this repository: https://osf.io/vbyzd/?view_only=1a40242e0d1941a58aa854af3e50cf6b).

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods significantly enhance the performance of SSL models on Arabic-English code-switching tasks and outperform larger multilingual models.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks. Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents RCO, a framework for training critic models using a feedback loop to improve LLM responses through effective critiques.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore effective critique methods for LLMs to enhance their responses and address the lack of research in generating useful critiques.

**Method:** RCO employs a feedback loop where critique utility quantifies the effectiveness of critiques, guiding the actor model to refine its outputs without needing direct critique preference assessment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Refinement-oriented Critique Optimization (RCO) framework.
	2. Novel supervision scheme focused on refined response preferences.
	3. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrating RCO's effectiveness across multiple tasks.

**Result:** RCO significantly outperforms traditional and open-source models across five tasks, demonstrating superior critique quality and refinement outcomes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of RCO and its supervision scheme based on refined response preferences proves effective in enhancing LLMs' critique-refinement processes.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented \textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e., dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM critique-refinement loops.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the instability of existing methods for querying LLMs about political biases, which hinders reliable comparisons between different models.

**Method:** The authors propose a new probing task called Questionnaire Modeling (QM), which utilizes human survey data as in-context examples for more stable bias evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Questionnaire Modeling (QM) for bias evaluation in LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of improved stability in bias assessment compared to existing methods.
	3. Evidence that larger models exhibit smaller bias scores and leverage in-context examples more effectively.

**Result:** Experiments show that QM enhances the reliability of bias assessment, reveals changes in bias direction with instruction tuning, and demonstrates that larger models can leverage in-context examples more effectively with generally lower bias scores.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that Questionnaire Modeling can be a more stable alternative for evaluating LLM biases and highlights the impact of model size and instruction tuning on bias outcomes.

**Abstract:** A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions. Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly available.

**TL;DR:** Novel method for detecting personal data in structured datasets using GPT-4o, which incorporates contextual information for improved performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance detection of personal data in structured datasets, addressing limitations of existing methods.

**Method:** We leverage GPT-4o to analyze personal data, utilizing contextual information from feature names and dataset descriptions in addition to feature values.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of GPT-4o for personal data detection in structured datasets.
	2. Incorporation of contextual information for improved accuracy.
	3. Comparative evaluation against well-known methods on multiple datasets.

**Result:** Our approach outperforms existing methods like CASSED and Microsoft Presidio, especially in leveraging context for datasets from Kaggle and OpenML; the MIMIC-Demo-Ext performance is competitive across models.

**Limitations:** Performance varies significantly across different datasets used for evaluation.

**Conclusion:** Further advancements require access to more real-world datasets containing personal information to enhance detection methods.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED, evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset, datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.   Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our GPT-4o-based approach.   We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing use of LLMs as evaluators in various fields has raised concerns about the biases inherent in their judgments, which affect fairness and reliability.

**Method:** The authors define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge and develop a comprehensive framework for its evaluation, supplemented by a dataset formed through data synthesis and multi-faceted evaluation metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition and evaluation framework for scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
	2. Augmentation of benchmarks through data synthesis
	3. Insights into prompt design and scoring bias mitigation strategies

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that scoring biases significantly disrupt the scoring stability of existing judge models, highlighting the need for improved design in scoring prompts and evaluation criteria.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study provides insights into mitigating scoring biases in LLMs, emphasizing the importance of score rubrics and selection processes for reference answers.

**Abstract:** The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However, there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

**TL;DR:** This study examines the effectiveness of random parsing strategies in communication accuracy using complex hierarchical inputs and a surprisal-related objective.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand why human parsing strategies do not resemble random selections, despite high communication accuracy in models with random strategies.

**Method:** The study modifies the experimental setup with complex hierarchical inputs and adds a surprisal-related term to the objective function to evaluate the performance of agents using random parsing strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates the role of hierarchical structure in language processing.
	2. Incorporates a surprisal-related term into the objective function for better evaluation.
	3. Demonstrates that random parsing can maintain communication accuracy with complexity.

**Result:** Agents using random parsing strategies maintained high communication accuracy even with more complex inputs and the new objective function.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Random parsing strategies can still be effective in achieving communication accuracy despite modifications that increase the complexity of inputs.

**Abstract:** If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases have reported that agents adopting random parsing strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, inference optimization, energy consumption, latency reduction, semantic adaptivity

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** QuickSilver is a token-level framework that optimizes inference for large language models (LLMs) without altering model weights, achieving significant FLOP reduction.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Runtime optimization in LLMs is a bottleneck causing high latency and energy consumption during inference, which necessitates more efficient methods without retraining or changing model architectures.

**Method:** QuickSilver introduces four mechanisms: Dynamic Token Halting to stop computation for converged tokens, KV Cache Skipping to reduce memory overhead, and Contextual Token Fusion to collapse redundant tokens.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Dynamic Token Halting
	2. KV Cache Skipping
	3. Contextual Token Fusion

**Result:** QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% reduction in FLOPs during inference with negligible degradation in perplexity, tested on GPT-2 and Llama-2.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** QuickSilver demonstrates that runtime efficiency can be improved without complex interventions, providing a modular approach to adapt inference under existing model constraints.

**Abstract:** Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost. While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits, and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular, token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four synergistic mechanisms:   (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.   Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

Our system is based on a neural network translation approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size, and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model links are available on https://github.com/ufal/tsd2025-gec.

It delivers competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The evaluation of language models for medical knowledge often fails to reflect real-world complexities; this paper aims to address that gap by emulating the iterative process of clinical diagnosis.

**Method:** The authors transform 304 NEJM clinicopathological cases into an interactive format, where AI or physicians iteratively query for additional information. Performance is measured by diagnostic accuracy and the cost-effectiveness of tests and visits.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark for evaluating diagnostic processes.
	2. Development of MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) that uses iterative querying for diagnostics.
	3. Significant accuracy and efficiency improvements in diagnostic performance using AI.

**Result:** MAI-DxO, combined with OpenAI's o3 model, achieves 80% diagnostic accuracy, significantly outperforming the average accuracy of generalist physicians while reducing diagnostic costs by 20%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AI systems that utilize an iterative approach may enhance diagnostic accuracy and lower costs in clinical care.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians, proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value, cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80% diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.

**Motivation:** To understand the limits of language models and to determine if increasing model size can bridge the performance gaps between LLMs and humans in language tasks.

**Method:** Three LLMs (Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, and ChatGPT-4) were tested on a grammaticality judgment task involving 1,200 judgments across different sentence conditions, with results compared to 80 human judgments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of the effect of model size on language task performance.
	2. Comparison of LLMs to human judgement in a grammaticality task.
	3. Identification of critical differences in language learning processes between humans and LLMs.

**Result:** ChatGPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy compared to 76% for humans, with better performance in grammatical sentence conditions but more oscillation in responses (12.5% for ChatGPT-4 vs. 9.6% for humans).

**Limitations:** LLMs may not exhibit human-like sensitivity to grammaticality despite increased size.

**Conclusion:** Scaling LLMs improves performance, but they lack human-like sensitivity to grammaticality, suggesting that size alone is insufficient to address this issue.

**Abstract:** Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language. LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size. This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models. We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity. N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt. Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli. We find that humans are overall less accurate than ChatGPT-4 (76% vs. 80% accuracy, respectively), but that this is due to ChatGPT-4 outperforming humans only in one task condition, namely on grammatical sentences. Additionally, ChatGPT-4 wavers more than humans in its answers (12.5% vs. 9.6% likelihood of an oscillating answer, respectively). Thus, while increased model size may lead to better performance, LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality the same way as humans are. It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue. We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference.

**TL;DR:** Introducing RLSF, a novel fine-tuning paradigm that leverages symbolic reasoning for LLMs to enhance domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve LLMs' performance on tasks requiring domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment, which traditional fine-tuning methods struggle with.

**Method:** Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF) uses symbolic reasoning tools to provide fine-grained feedback and correct errors in LLM outputs without needing differentiable reasoning systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RLSF for LLM fine-tuning
	2. Utilization of symbolic reasoning tools for feedback
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements over traditional fine-tuning methods

**Result:** RLSF fine-tuning outperforms traditional methods in five different applications, including program synthesis and three chemistry tasks, by enabling smaller LLMs to outperform larger closed-source models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RLSF enables precise alignment of LLMs with domain-specific constraints and addresses the limitations of traditional reward signals for fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models.   We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals.   Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, data composition, pre-training, machine learning, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel multi-bucket data composition method that improves the pre-training of Large Language Models by addressing challenges related to fixed-length data composition, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The conventional fixed-length data composition strategy for pre-training Large Language Models often leads to information loss and inefficiencies in handling document boundaries and semantic coherence.

**Method:** The paper proposes a multi-bucket data composition method that adapts the organization of training data based on three quantitative metrics: padding ratio, truncation ratio, and concatenation ratio, to optimize data composition quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of three quantitative metrics for evaluating data composition quality
	2. Development of a multi-bucket data composition method
	3. Demonstration of improved pre-training efficiency and effectiveness for LLMs.

**Result:** Experimental results show that the proposed multi-bucket method significantly improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of pre-training Large Language Models compared to conventional methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach offers a flexible and efficient alternative to fixed-length composition, improving the training process for Large Language Models.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various tasks, with pre-training stage serving as the cornerstone of their capabilities. However, the conventional fixed-length data composition strategy for pre-training presents several practical challenges. When using shorter sequences, documents are often truncated, potentially leading to information loss and affecting the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. Conversely, longer sequences require concatenation of multiple documents, which can introduce noise and affect the natural document boundaries and semantic coherence as well as require substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we first establish three quantitative metrics for evaluating data composition quality: padding ratio, truncation ratio, and concatenation ratio. Building upon these metrics, we propose a novel multi-bucket data composition method that transcends the fixed-length paradigm. Our approach adaptively organizes training data to achieve optimal composition quality as measured by the proposed metrics, offering a more flexible and efficient approach for pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pre-training.

**Conclusion:** The DAO module serves as an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing multi-task learning frameworks used in sentiment analysis, demonstrating superior performance on financial text datasets.

**Abstract:** Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as business intelligence and financial forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy (ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) that still occur despite using RAG, due to incomplete knowledge extraction and misunderstandings.

**Method:** The method involves computing relevance between the input and output of the RAG generator using LRP, followed by extraction and resampling to create a relevance matrix that is analyzed by multiple classifiers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of LRP4RAG for hallucination detection in RAG
	2. First application of LRP for this purpose
	3. Demonstrated improved performance over existing methods

**Result:** The experiments show that LRP4RAG significantly outperforms existing methods in detecting hallucinations in RAG outputs.

**Limitations:** The paper may not address other aspects of RAG performance beyond hallucination detection.

**Conclusion:** LRP4RAG is effective for hallucination detection in RAG and is the first application of LRP in this context, suggesting its potential for improving the reliability of language models.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a primary technique for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, incomplete knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding can still mislead LLMs to produce irrelevant or even contradictory responses, which means hallucinations persist in RAG. In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations in RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the input and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and resampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into multiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for detecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.

**Abstract:** Effective question classification is crucial for AI-driven educational tools, enabling adaptive learning systems to categorize questions by skill area, difficulty level, and competence. It not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex downstream tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in question statements, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks, named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN). Through PQ-GCN, we evaluate the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification performance on question datasets of various domains and characteristics. The proposed method, augmented with phrase-based features, outperform baseline graph-based methods in low-resource settings, and performs competitively against language model-based methods with a fraction of their parameter size. Our findings offer a possible solution for more context-aware, parameter-efficient question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and its educational applications.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents ProLong-8B, a language model optimized for long-context tasks, outperforming existing models in both efficiency and effectiveness.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a language model that can effectively leverage long-context information, improving usability in natural language understanding tasks.

**Method:** The study employs a robust evaluation protocol assessing long-context performance using a variety of downstream tasks, and conducts experiments on data mix for continued training and fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a reliable evaluation protocol for long-context tasks
	2. Development of ProLong-8B, a state-of-the-art long-context language model
	3. Experimental insights on effective data mix for training and fine-tuning

**Result:** ProLong-8B, trained on a diverse dataset and enhanced with short and long-context data, shows state-of-the-art performance in long-context tasks, significantly outperforming Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

**Limitations:** The model's performance may vary with different types of tasks and data quality, and the training process may require large computational resources.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the importance of combining different data sources and training approaches for maximizing long-context capabilities in language models.

**Abstract:** We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of studies that quantify the uncertainty of LLMs, which limits understanding of their performance variability.

**Method:** The authors use benchmarks for reasoning about cardinal directions to systematically explore the effects of experimental repeats on mean scores and prediction intervals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a method for quantifying uncertainty in LLM benchmarking.
	2. Demonstrates the impact of experimental repeats on model evaluation results.

**Result:** The study finds that repeated experiments can significantly impact mean scores and provides a cost-effective method for quantifying uncertainty.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The authors recommend their method for reproducible LLM evaluation and emphasize the importance of accounting for uncertainty in performance assessments.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are stochastic, and not all models give deterministic answers, even when setting temperature to zero with a fixed random seed. However, few benchmark studies attempt to quantify uncertainty, partly due to the time and cost of repeated experiments. We use benchmarks designed for testing LLMs' capacity to reason about cardinal directions to explore the impact of experimental repeats on mean score and prediction interval. We suggest a simple method for cost-effectively quantifying the uncertainty of a benchmark score and make recommendations concerning reproducible LLM evaluation.

**Conclusion:** DARSE effectively balances computational efficiency and model performance, positioning it as a strong candidate for sentiment analysis applications using LLMs.

**Abstract:** Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important for assessing public opinion and informing decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized this field by capturing nuanced language patterns. However, adapting LLMs to domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for optimal fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space Exploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis using LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the optimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank selection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank combination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1% improvement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous work. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and model performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with LLMs.

**Motivation:** To assess the knowledge limits of PLMs in ultra-fine entity typing when pre-training data is unavailable.

**Method:** A novel heuristic is proposed to approximate the pre-training distribution of entities, followed by systematic evaluation of entity-typing performance with and without knowledge infusion.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel heuristic for approximating pre-training distribution
	2. Systematic demonstration of PLM limitations on infrequent entities
	3. Advocacy for knowledge-infused approaches in entity typing

**Result:** PLMs show significant performance struggles with infrequent entities at the long tail of the distribution, highlighting the necessity for knowledge-infused approaches.

**Limitations:** The study does not address the potential effectiveness of using more diverse pre-training datasets or advanced fine-tuning techniques on PLMs.

**Conclusion:** To achieve better performance for ultra-fine entity typing, solutions must extend beyond the capabilities of PLMs.

**Abstract:** Due to their capacity to acquire world knowledge from large corpora, pre-trained language models (PLMs) are extensively used in ultra-fine entity typing tasks where the space of labels is extremely large. In this work, we explore the limitations of the knowledge acquired by PLMs by proposing a novel heuristic to approximate the pre-training distribution of entities when the pre-training data is unknown. Then, we systematically demonstrate that entity-typing approaches that rely solely on the parametric knowledge of PLMs struggle significantly with entities at the long tail of the pre-training distribution, and that knowledge-infused approaches can account for some of these shortcomings. Our findings suggest that we need to go beyond PLMs to produce solutions that perform well for infrequent entities.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the role of triggers in document-level event extraction, highlighting their varied importance based on dataset characteristics and task-specific information.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing research in event extraction predominantly focuses on sentence-level texts, presuming the need for trigger spans to identify events. This paper investigates the necessity and impact of triggers in the more complex task of document-level event extraction.

**Method:** The authors analyze different transformer-based event extraction models (end-to-end and pipelined) across three document-level datasets, evaluating performance using triggers of different qualities, including human-annotated, LLM-generated, keyword-based, and random triggers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First exploration of trigger roles in document-level event extraction
	2. Comparative analysis of trigger effectiveness across various qualities
	3. Insights into the impact of triggers on transformer-based models for event extraction

**Result:** The findings reveal that the effectiveness of trigger extraction is influenced by the dataset characteristics and the availability of task-specific information. Additionally, the presence of triggers—even random ones—plays a crucial role in enhancing performance in prompt-based learning approaches.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that triggers can significantly affect document-level event extraction performance, underlining their varied impact based on contextual factors.

**Abstract:** Most existing work on event extraction has focused on sentence-level texts and presumes the identification of a trigger-span -- a word or phrase in the input that evokes the occurrence of an event of interest. Event arguments are then extracted with respect to the trigger. Indeed, triggers are treated as integral to, and trigger detection as an essential component of, event extraction. In this paper, we provide the first investigation of the role of triggers for the more difficult and much less studied task of document-level event extraction. We analyze their usefulness in multiple end-to-end and pipelined transformer-based event extraction models for three document-level event extraction datasets, measuring performance using triggers of varying quality (human-annotated, LLM-generated, keyword-based, and random). We find that whether or not systems benefit from explicitly extracting triggers depends both on dataset characteristics (i.e. the typical number of events per document) and task-specific information available during extraction (i.e. natural language event schemas). Perhaps surprisingly, we also observe that the mere existence of triggers in the input, even random ones, is important for prompt-based in-context learning approaches to the task.

**Conclusion:** While BERT outperforms SVM models, SVM with BoW and TF-IDF offers competitive performance with lower computational needs.

**Abstract:** The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect fake news. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW), evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.

**Motivation:** To evaluate and improve parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, specifically focusing on sparsity-based approaches that offer greater flexibility compared to traditional methods.

**Method:** The authors conduct rigorous evaluations of salience metrics for SPEFT, using gradient-based metrics for efficiency, and compare static versus dynamic masking strategies for fine-tuning LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that more complex methods are not necessarily better for PEFT, and the study provides an open-source framework for reproducibility in future research.

**Abstract:** Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has gained prominence through low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA. In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple yet effective baseline for SPEFT. Our work challenges the notion that complexity is necessary for effective PEFT, while our open-source framework establishes a reproducible benchmark for future research, which is available at [https://github.com/0-ml/speft].

**Keywords:** long document summarization, transformer models, gradient caching

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** CachED is a new method for training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization without truncating input documents, using gradient caching and non-overlapping sliding windows.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of training transformer-based models for long document summarization due to high memory usage and the mismatch between training and test conditions.

**Method:** CachED uses non-overlapping sliding windows on input documents, caches gradients at the decoder, and recomputes hidden vectors in chunks during backpropagation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CachED for training without truncation
	2. Application of non-overlapping sliding windows for input handling
	3. Enhanced performance in long document summarization tasks

**Result:** CachED BART processes over 500K tokens during training, achieving superior performance compared to traditional methods without additional parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CachED allows the use of entire documents for training transformer models, leading to improved summarization performance.

**Abstract:** Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo), a method to enhance language model pre-training with metadata, improving efficiency and performance across various tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To efficiently learn correct behaviors from diverse language model pre-training corpora, which present challenges due to their varying styles and qualities.

**Method:** MeCo integrates metadata into the training process, followed by a cooldown phase using only standard text, allowing models to operate without metadata post-training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo) for language model training.
	2. Significant reduction in data requirements while maintaining performance.
	3. Capability to steer models using real or fabricated metadata.

**Result:** Models trained with MeCo demonstrate improved pre-training efficiency, achieving the same performance with 33% less data while allowing for the steering of outputs through conditioned metadata.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MeCo provides a simple and effective approach to enhance language model capabilities without added computational costs.

**Abstract:** The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language model pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model capabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors exemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging. To address this, we propose a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training. MeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like www$.$wikipedia$.$org) alongside the text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard text, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata. MeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M to 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For instance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task performance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally, MeCo enables us to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt on either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of the output: for example, prepending wikipedia$.$org to reduce harmful generations or factquizmaster$.$com (fabricated) to improve common knowledge task performance. We also demonstrate that MeCo is compatible with different types of metadata, such as model-generated topics. MeCo is remarkably simple, adds no computational overhead, and demonstrates promise in producing more capable and steerable language models.

**Limitations:** The dataset relies on forum content which may bias the types of problems available and their interpretations.

**Conclusion:** The paper illustrates a scalable method for generating and maintaining high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in this area.

**Abstract:** Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

**Motivation:** The safety and harmlessness of LLMs are as crucial as their performance, especially in the context of malicious queries and safety-performance trade-offs.

**Method:** The STAIR framework integrates SafeTy Alignment with Introspective Reasoning, employing structured reasoning and iterative preference optimization using Safety-Informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (SI-MCTS).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the STAIR framework for aligning LLMs with safety and reasoning capabilities.

	3. Demonstration of effective mitigation of harmful outputs while preserving helpfulness in LLM responses.

**Result:** Experimental results show that STAIR effectively reduces harmful outputs without sacrificing helpfulness, achieving safety performance similar to that of Claude-3.5 against prevalent jailbreak attacks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** STAIR offers a novel approach to aligning LLMs safely, emphasizing introspective reasoning to enhance safety while maintaining usability.

**Abstract:** Ensuring the safety and harmlessness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become equally critical as their performance in applications. However, existing safety alignment methods typically suffer from safety-performance trade-offs and the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, primarily due to their reliance on direct refusals for malicious queries. In this paper, we propose STAIR, a novel framework that integrates SafeTy Alignment with Itrospective Reasoning. We enable LLMs to identify safety risks through step-by-step analysis by self-improving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with safety awareness. STAIR first equips the model with a structured reasoning capability and then advances safety alignment via iterative preference optimization on step-level reasoning data generated using our newly proposed Safety-Informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (SI-MCTS). We further train a process reward model on this data to guide test-time searches for improved responses. Extensive experiments show that STAIR effectively mitigates harmful outputs while better preserving helpfulness, compared to instinctive alignment strategies. With test-time scaling, STAIR achieves a safety performance comparable to Claude-3.5 against popular jailbreak attacks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing RAG models for medical applications often lack diagnostic accuracy for diseases with similar manifestations, leading to potential misdiagnosis.

**Method:** MedRAG constructs a four-tier hierarchical diagnostic knowledge graph that integrates critical diagnostic differences and utilizes a large language model for decision support based on EHRs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a four-tier diagnostic knowledge graph for healthcare applications.
	2. Integration of EHRs with knowledge graph reasoning within a large language model.
	3. Demonstrated improvements in diagnostic accuracy and reduction of misdiagnosis rates compared to existing RAG models.

**Result:** MedRAG outperforms existing methods on the DDXPlus and CPDD datasets by providing more specific diagnostic insights and effectively reducing misdiagnosis rates.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MedRAG's enhanced reasoning capabilities improve medical decision-making and help in delivering more accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework shows that using granular CR rewards effectively enhances environment generalization, with a 7B-parameter system achieving competitive results against strong closed-source models.

**Abstract:** LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Round Attention efficiently manages memory resources in LLMs while preserving the quality of model outputs, making it a significant advancement for dialogue systems.

**Abstract:** The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round Attention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes the KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined through the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54\% to 82\%, while experimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache maintains answer accuracy without performance degradation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The identified knowledge boundary for one VLLM can serve as a surrogate for others, suggesting a broader applicability of the method across different VLLMs.

**Abstract:** Despite the advancements made in Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs), like text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive. Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tunes a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To determine whether quantization methods that prioritize English hinder multilingual performance in LLMs.

**Method:** Quantized the Llama3.3 70B model using importance matrices in English, Norwegian, and Malayalam, then evaluated the model's performance on the MixEval dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of LLM performance under different linguistic importance matrices
	2. Evaluation of quantization impact on multilingual capabilities
	3. Evidence suggesting current practices maintain multilingual performance

**Result:** The experiments conducted showed non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.

**Limitations:** Results are non-significant, suggesting the need for further studies with larger datasets or more diverse languages.

**Conclusion:** Different importance matrices do not seem to lead to significant variations in multilingual performance when quantizing LLMs.

**Abstract:** For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and k\_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to yielded non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TableLoRA shows high potential for improving LLM capabilities in handling tabular tasks, particularly in low-parameter contexts.

**Abstract:** Tabular data are crucial in many fields and their understanding by large language models (LLMs) under high parameter efficiency paradigm is important. However, directly applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to tabular tasks presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of better table serialization and the representation of two-dimensional structured information within a one-dimensional sequence. To address this, we propose TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs' understanding of table structure during PEFT. It incorporates special tokens for serializing tables with special token encoder and uses 2D LoRA to encode low-rank information on cell positions. Experiments on four tabular-related datasets demonstrate that TableLoRA consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA and surpasses various table encoding methods tested in control experiments. These findings reveal that TableLoRA, as a table-specific LoRA, enhances the ability of LLMs to process tabular data effectively, especially in low-parameter settings, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for handling table-related tasks.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the introduction of grammar and concept rewards enhances both grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts in generated descriptions.

**Abstract:** Game Description Generation (GDG) is the task of generating a game description written in a Game Description Language (GDL) from natural language text. Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone. Our code is available at https://github.com/tsunehiko/rlgdg

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces MMCR, a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) reasoning capabilities with cross-source information from scientific papers, revealing significant challenges for current models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for machines to fully comprehend scientific papers represents a key challenge in achieving advanced Artificial General Intelligence, particularly in reasoning across diverse sources.

**Method:** The benchmark MMCR consists of 276 annotated questions across 7 subjects and 10 task types, used to evaluate the performance of 18 VLMs in cross-source reasoning tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MMCR benchmark for evaluating VLMs
	2. Presentation of empirical results showing the challenges in cross-source reasoning
	3. Analysis of the impact of the Chain-of-Thought technique on model performance

**Result:** Experiments show that even the best model, GPT-4o, only achieved 48.55% accuracy overall, with notable poor performance in multi-table comprehension tasks (20% accuracy).

**Limitations:** The benchmark only includes 276 questions which may limit the generalizability of results and insights into reasoning complexity.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate the necessity for more capable VLMs that can effectively reason with cross-source information, especially given the varying effects of the Chain-of-Thought technique on different model sizes.

**Abstract:** Fully comprehending scientific papers by machines reflects a high level of Artificial General Intelligence, requiring the ability to reason across fragmented and heterogeneous sources of information, presenting a complex and practically significant challenge. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly those involving reasoning with evidence source from single image or text page, their ability to use cross-source information for reasoning remains an open problem. This work presents MMCR, a high-difficulty benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' capacity for reasoning with cross-source information from scientific papers. The benchmark comprises 276 high-quality questions, meticulously annotated by humans across 7 subjects and 10 task types. Experiments with 18 VLMs demonstrate that cross-source reasoning presents a substantial challenge for existing models. Notably, even the top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved only 48.55% overall accuracy, with only 20% accuracy in multi-table comprehension tasks, while the second-best model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, reached 39.86% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique on cross-source reasoning and observed a detrimental effect on small models, whereas larger models demonstrated substantially enhanced performance. These results highlight the pressing need to develop VLMs capable of effectively utilizing cross-source information for reasoning.

### [144] [Benchmarking Vision Language Models on German Factual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11108)

*René Peinl, Vincent Tischler*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Vision Language Models, German, Factual Knowledge, Cultural Context, Image Recognition

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Analysis of vision language models (VLMs) revealing poor performance in German language contexts, particularly with local cultural images.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the underperformance of VLMs in languages other than English and Chinese, particularly German, and to identify specific areas of weakness.

**Method:** The study employs accuracy analysis using jury judgments to differentiate between image-related and textual factors in VLMs for both German and English prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comprehensive analysis of VLM performance in German compared to English.
	2. Identification of specific categories where VLMs fail in German (celebrities and sights).
	3. Insights into the accuracy of VLMs for identifying scientific names vs. common names in German.

**Result:** VLMs show significant struggles with German content related to celebrities and sights, but perform reasonably well with scientific names of animals and plants, and equally identify cars and supermarket products in both languages.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on factual knowledge and does not explore other VLM capabilities or metrics.

**Conclusion:** VLMs need improvements in visual cognition specifically for German cultural contexts to enhance their performance in this language.

**Abstract:** Similar to LLMs, the development of vision language models is mainly driven by English datasets and models trained in English and Chinese language, whereas support for other languages, even those considered high-resource languages such as German, remains significantly weaker. In this work we present an analysis of open-weight VLMs on factual knowledge in the German and English language. We disentangle the image-related aspects from the textual ones by analyzing accu-racy with jury-as-a-judge in both prompt languages and images from German and international contexts. We found that for celebrities and sights, VLMs struggle because they are lacking visual cognition of German image contents. For animals and plants, the tested models can often correctly identify the image contents ac-cording to the scientific name or English common name but fail in German lan-guage. Cars and supermarket products were identified equally well in English and German images across both prompt languages.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** semantic representation learning, compositional semantics, autoencoders

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes integrating compositional and symbolic properties into distributional semantic spaces to improve Transformer-based language models' interpretability and generalization.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the interpretability, controllability, and compositionality of language models by bridging symbolic and distributional semantics.

**Method:** The paper surveys different autoencoder architectures (VAE, VQVAE, SAE) and analyzes their latent geometries in relation to semantic structure.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the concept of semantic representation learning that bridges symbolic and distributional semantics.
	2. Compares distinct autoencoder architectures and their effects on latent space geometry.
	3. Provides insights into enhancing language model interpretability through compositional properties.

**Result:** It reveals how different architectures produce distinctive latent spaces that influence interpretability and compositional understanding in language models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating compositional semantics can help improve the performance and understanding of language models in AI applications.

**Abstract:** Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability, compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and interpretability.

### [146] [Time is On My Side: Dynamics of Talk-Time Sharing in Video-chat Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20474)

*Kaixiang Zhang, Justine Zhang, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** talk-time sharing, human-computer interaction, conversational analysis

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a computational framework for analyzing talk-time distribution in conversations, emphasizing the dynamics of speaker engagement and preference for balanced exchanges.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding how talk-time is shared in conversations is essential for improving communication in both human-human and human-AI interactions.

**Method:** The framework quantifies talk-time sharing dynamics and categorizes them into a typology based on various axes of variation, validated using a dataset of video-chats.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a computational framework for analyzing talk-time dynamics in conversations
	2. Derivation of a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics
	3. Insights for designers of communication platforms from empirical findings

**Result:** Analysis reveals that balanced talk-time is preferred by participants, especially those who speak less, with different dynamics influencing perceptions of the conversation even when overall balance is maintained.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduced framework provides valuable insights for designing better communication platforms, enhancing both human-human and human-AI interactions.

**Abstract:** An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who should be talking at every point in time, and for how long? In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that, perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less. Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance -- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology. Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI communication.
