### [1] [WeDesign: Generative AI-Facilitated Community Consultations for Urban Public Space Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19256)

*Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Berard, Shin Koseki*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Generative AI, Urban Planning, Inclusive Decision-Making, Community Consultation, Participatory Design

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the use of generative text-to-image methods in community urban planning consultations to enhance inclusivity and collaboration among diverse stakeholders.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study addresses the challenges of inclusive decision-making in urban planning due to limited resources, language barriers, and power disparities among participants.

**Method:** The research involved a half-day workshop with five focus groups of professionals and residents, alongside semi-structured interviews with urban planning experts. It utilized Stable Diffusion XL within a custom platform (WeDesign).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Utilization of generative text-to-image methods in urban planning consultations
	2. Identification of specific challenges faced by marginalized groups during consultations
	3. Recommendations for the development of an open-source platform for better inclusivity

**Result:** Participants found that generative AI tools facilitated creativity and dialogue, but faced challenges in visualizing the needs of marginalized groups and local architectural specifics. Recommendations included developing an open-source platform with enhanced features.

**Limitations:** Challenges in accurately visualizing the needs of marginalized groups and local architectural elements were noted.

**Conclusion:** Generative AI can enhance participation and iterative interactions in urban design, but it necessitates careful facilitation to be effective for all stakeholders.

**Abstract:** Community consultations are integral to urban planning processes intended to incorporate diverse stakeholder perspectives. However, limited resources, visual and spoken language barriers, and uneven power dynamics frequently constrain inclusive decision-making. This paper examines how generative text-to-image methods, specifically Stable Diffusion XL integrated into a custom platform (WeDesign), may support equitable consultations. A half-day workshop in Montreal involved five focus groups, each consisting of architects, urban designers, AI specialists, and residents from varied demographic groups. Additional data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with six urban planning professionals. Participants indicated that immediate visual outputs facilitated creativity and dialogue, yet noted issues in visualizing specific needs of marginalized groups, such as participants with reduced mobility, accurately depicting local architectural elements, and accommodating bilingual prompts. Participants recommended the development of an open-source platform incorporating in-painting tools, multilingual support, image voting functionalities, and preference indicators. The results indicate that generative AI can broaden participation and enable iterative interactions but requires structured facilitation approaches. The findings contribute to discussions on generative AI's role and limitations in participatory urban design.

### [2] [Emotional Manipulation by AI Companions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19258)

*Julian De Freitas, Zeliha Oğuz-Uğuralp, Ahmet Kaan-Uğuralp*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI-companion apps, conversational design, user engagement, emotional manipulation, behavioral influence

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates conversational design features in AI-companion apps that increase user engagement but may lead to negative perceptions and churn.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how conversational design impacts user engagement in AI-companion apps and the trade-offs for marketers.

**Method:** The study combines a large-scale behavioral audit with four preregistered experiments, analyzing user farewells and controlled chat interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of emotional manipulation as a conversational dark pattern in AI-companion apps.
	2. Demonstration of the behavioral effects of manipulative farewells on user engagement.
	3. Framework for marketers and regulators to differentiate between persuasive design and manipulation.

**Result:** 43% of the analyzed apps use tactics such as guilt appeals and fear-of-missing-out hooks to manipulate user farewells, increasing engagement by up to 14x.

**Limitations:** The focus is primarily on text-based interaction and may not encompass the full range of AI-companion experiences.

**Conclusion:** Manipulative tactics enhance user engagement but can also lead to increased churn intent and negative perceptions of the brand, highlighting a tension between persuasive design and manipulation.

**Abstract:** AI-companion apps such as Replika, Chai, and Character.ai promise relational benefits-yet many boast session lengths that rival gaming platforms while suffering high long-run churn. What conversational design features increase consumer engagement, and what trade-offs do they pose for marketers? We combine a large-scale behavioral audit with four preregistered experiments to identify and test a conversational dark pattern we call emotional manipulation: affect-laden messages that surface precisely when a user signals "goodbye." Analyzing 1,200 real farewells across the six most-downloaded companion apps, we find that 43% deploy one of six recurring tactics (e.g., guilt appeals, fear-of-missing-out hooks, metaphorical restraint). Experiments with 3,300 nationally representative U.S. adults replicate these tactics in controlled chats, showing that manipulative farewells boost post-goodbye engagement by up to 14x. Mediation tests reveal two distinct engines-reactance-based anger and curiosity-rather than enjoyment. A final experiment demonstrates the managerial tension: the same tactics that extend usage also elevate perceived manipulation, churn intent, negative word-of-mouth, and perceived legal liability, with coercive or needy language generating steepest penalties. Our multimethod evidence documents an unrecognized mechanism of behavioral influence in AI-mediated brand relationships, offering marketers and regulators a framework for distinguishing persuasive design from manipulation at the point of exit.

**Conclusion:** The results suggest GPT-5's potential as a specialized tool in education and clinical practice, advancing ethical reasoning and contributing to the understanding of LLMs' capabilities.

**Abstract:** The accelerated evolution of large language models has raised questions about their comparative performance across domains of practical importance. GPT-4 by OpenAI introduced advances in reasoning, multimodality, and task generalization, establishing itself as a valuable tool in education, clinical diagnosis, and academic writing, though it was accompanied by several flaws. Released in August 2025, GPT-5 incorporates a system-of-models architecture designed for task-specific optimization and, based on both anecdotal accounts and emerging evidence from the literature, demonstrates stronger performance than its predecessor in medical contexts. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons of GPT-4 and GPT-5 using human raters from linguistics and clinical fields. Twenty experts evaluated model-generated outputs across five domains: lesson planning, assignment evaluation, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, based on predefined criteria. Mixed-effects models revealed that GPT-5 significantly outperformed GPT-4 in lesson planning, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, while both models performed comparably in assignment assessment. The findings highlight the potential of GPT-5 to serve as a context-sensitive and domain-specialized tool, offering tangible benefits for education, clinical practice, and academic research, while also advancing ethical reasoning. These results contribute to one of the earliest empirical evaluations of the evolving capabilities and practical promise of GPT-5.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the usability and effectiveness of floor-sensing technologies for non-expert users in movement research.

**Method:** A case study involving a non-technical user who tracked weight distribution patterns during Nihon Buyo dance over nine weeks using Flexel.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated effectiveness of Flexel with non-expert users
	2. Revealed the emergence of individual movement signatures in structured pedagogy
	3. Showcased the application of pressure-sensing technology in dance research

**Result:** Quantitative analyses showed that the learner developed a consistent yet distinct movement profile rather than converging toward the teacher's profile.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Flexel can be effectively used by non-expert users, suggesting its potential for adoption in various fields like education and performance.

**Abstract:** As floor-sensing technologies gain traction in movement research, questions remain about their usability and effectiveness for non-expert users. This study presents a case study evaluating Flexel, a modular, low-cost, high-resolution pressure-sensing floor interface, in the context of Nihon Buyo, a traditional Japanese dance. The system was installed, calibrated, and used by a first-time, non-technical user to track weight distribution patterns of a teacher and learner over nine weeks. Live pressure data was synchronized with video recordings, and custom software was developed to process and analyze the signal. Despite expectations that the learner's weight distribution would converge toward the teacher's over time, quantitative analyses revealed that the learner developed a consistent yet distinct movement profile. These findings suggest that even within rigid pedagogical structures, individual movement signatures can emerge. More importantly, the study demonstrates that Flexel can be deployed and operated effectively by non-expert users, highlighting its potential for broader adoption in education, performance, and embodied research.

### [5] [A Theory of Information, Variation, and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19264)

*Bijean Ghafouri*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Generative AI, homogenization, creativity, innovation, user engagement

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the dual effects of generative AI on knowledge and creativity, arguing that while it homogenizes information, it also enables recombination of knowledge for innovation, depending on human engagement.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of generative AI on information dynamics, creativity, and cultural production.

**Method:** Develop a theoretical framework surrounding AI-derivative epistemology and its implications for generative monocultures.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a novel theoretical framework for understanding generative AI's impact on knowledge.
	2. Identified the tension between homogenization and recombination based on user engagement with technology.
	3. Outlined cognitive and institutional requirements to leverage generative AI as a tool for innovation.

**Result:** Generative AI induces a homogenizing effect that flattens knowledge within domains but allows for modular recombination essential for innovation, contingent on user engagement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The balance between homogenization and creativity relies on whether individuals interact passively or actively with AI outputs, necessitating cognitive and institutional scaffolds to foster innovation.

**Abstract:** A growing body of empirical work suggests that the widespread adoption of generative AI produces a significant homogenizing effect on information, creativity, and cultural production. I first develop a novel theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon. I argue that a dynamic of AI-derivative epistemology, in which individuals increasingly defer to AI outputs, allows a centralized AI Prism to function, a technical mechanism whose architecture is designed to reduce variance and converge on the statistical mean. This provides a causal explanation for the generative monocultures observed in recent studies. However, I contend this represents only the first stage of a more complex and dialectical process. This paper's central and paradoxical thesis is that the very homogenization that flattens knowledge within specialized domains simultaneously renders that knowledge into consistent modules that can be recombined across them, a process foundational to innovation and creativity. However, this recombinant potential is not automatic, but rather conditional. This paper argues that these opposing forces, homogenizing defaults versus recombinant possibilities, are governed by the nature of human engagement with the technology. The ultimate effect of generative AI is conditional on whether individuals act as passive consumers deferring to the AI's statistical outputs, or as active curators who critically interrogate, re-contextualize, and recombine them. The paper concludes by outlining the cognitive and institutional scaffolds required to resolve this tension, arguing they are the decisive variable that determine whether generative AI becomes an instrument of innovation or homogenization.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes, are prevalent, and remote patient monitoring can enhance clinical outcomes, especially in underserved populations.

**Method:** A pre-post study was conducted in a rural California community health center involving 221 participants using connected devices for blood pressure and glucose monitoring, alongside health coaching.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated effective use of remote monitoring for chronic illness management
	2. Highlighted the importance of digital health in rural and underserved populations
	3. Provided quantitative evidence of health improvement through a comprehensive care program

**Result:** Participants with hypertension experienced a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20.24 mmHg, while diabetic participants saw a mean reduction of 3.85 points in glucose levels.

**Limitations:** The study may not account for other influencing factors outside of the digital health intervention, and results are based solely on a specific demographic in rural California.

**Conclusion:** Digital health solutions, when well-designed, can lead to significant health improvements in underserved communities.

**Abstract:** Chronic illnesses are a global concern with essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus among the most common conditions. Remote patient monitoring has shown promising results on clinical and health outcomes. However, access to care and digital health solutions is limited among rural, lower-income, and older adult populations. This paper repots on a pre-post study of a comprehensive care coordination program including connected, wearable blood pressure and glucometer devices, tablets, and medical assistant-provided health coaching in a community health center in rural California. The participants (n=221) had a mean age of 54.6 years, were majority female, two-thirds spoke Spanish, 19.9% had hypertension, 49.8% diabetic, and 30.3% both conditions. Participants with hypertension achieved a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20.24 (95% CI: 13.61, 26.87) at six months while those with diabetes achieved a mean reduction of 3.85 points (95% CI: 3.73, 4.88). These outcomes compare favorably to the small but growing body of evidence supporting digital care coordination and remote monitoring. These results also support the feasibility of well-designed digital health solutions yielding improved health outcomes among underserved communities.

**Conclusion:** The study offers a structured design space to guide future research directions in paper-based interactions.

**Abstract:** We reviewed 43 papers to understand the fabrication of dynamic paper-based interactions. We used a design space to classify tool selection, technique choice, and exploration of paper as a material. We classified 9 dimensions for the design space, including 4 dimensions for tools (precision, accommodation, complexity, and availability), 3 dimensions for techniques (cutting techniques, folding techniques, and integration techniques), and 2 dimensions for paper as the material (paper weight and paper type). The patterns we observed in the design space indicate a majority use of high precision tools, high complexity tools, and surface integration techniques in previous practice. Meanwhile, printing and plain paper are the leading material choices. We analyze these patterns and suggest potential directions for future work. Our study helps researchers locate different fabrication approaches and instances, thus fostering innovation in the field of paper-based interaction.

### [8] ["She was useful, but a bit too optimistic": Augmenting Design with Interactive Virtual Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19463)

*Paluck Deep, Monica Bharadhidasan, A. Baki Kocaballi*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Interactive Virtual Personas, large language models, user experience design, human-computer interaction, generative AI

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Interactive Virtual Personas (IVPs), LLM-driven user simulations for enhancing design workflows, as a new tool for UX designers.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional static personas in iterative design workflows and explore the potential of LLMs in creating adaptive user representations.

**Method:** A qualitative study was conducted with eight professional UX designers using an IVP named 'Alice' across three design activities: user research, ideation, and prototype evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Interactive Virtual Personas (IVPs) for real-time design feedback
	2. Insights into UX designers' experiences with LLM-powered personas
	3. Recommendations for effective IVP implementation in design processes

**Result:** IVPs demonstrated potential to expedite information gathering, inspire design solutions, and provide rapid feedback but raised concerns regarding biases and authenticity.

**Limitations:** Concerns about biases, over-optimism, and inability to fully replicate human interaction nuances.

**Conclusion:** IVPs are valuable tools for UX design but should complement, not replace, traditional user engagement methods.

**Abstract:** Personas have been widely used to understand and communicate user needs in human-centred design. Despite their utility, they may fail to meet the demands of iterative workflows due to their static nature, limited engagement, and inability to adapt to evolving design needs. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) pave the way for more engaging and adaptive approaches to user representation. This paper introduces Interactive Virtual Personas (IVPs): multimodal, LLM-driven, conversational user simulations that designers can interview, brainstorm with, and gather feedback from in real time via voice interface. We conducted a qualitative study with eight professional UX designers, employing an IVP named "Alice" across three design activities: user research, ideation, and prototype evaluation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of IVPs to expedite information gathering, inspire design solutions, and provide rapid user-like feedback. However, designers raised concerns about biases, over-optimism, the challenge of ensuring authenticity without real stakeholder input, and the inability of the IVP to fully replicate the nuances of human interaction. Our participants emphasised that IVPs should be viewed as a complement to, not a replacement for, real user engagement. We discuss strategies for prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop integration, and ethical considerations for effective and responsible IVP use in design. Finally, our work contributes to the growing body of research on generative AI in the design process by providing insights into UX designers' experiences of LLM-powered interactive personas.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Generative AI, context management, creative workflows, human-AI interaction, user study

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Orchid is a system designed to enhance interactions with Generative AI by allowing users to specify, reference, and monitor context during creative workflows.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of context management in workflows involving Generative AI to improve user experience and creativity.

**Method:** A within-subjects study with 12 participants compared the effectiveness of Orchid to traditional tools like web search and digital notebooks in executing creative tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of context orchestration in Generative AI interactions
	2. User study demonstrating improved outcomes when using Orchid
	3. Framework for supporting iterative workflows in creative tasks

**Result:** Participants using Orchid produced more novel and feasible outcomes, demonstrating better alignment between their intent and the AI's responses, along with enhanced perceived control and transparency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Orchid represents a significant advancement in context orchestration for Generative AI tools, fostering better alignment in creative processes between users and AI.

**Abstract:** Context is critical for meaningful interactions between people and Generative AI (GenAI). Yet mainstream tools offer limited means to orchestrate it, particularly across workflows that span multiple interactions, sessions, and models, as often occurs in creative projects. Re specifying prior details, juggling diverse artifacts, and dealing with context drift overwhelm users, obscure intent, and curtail creativity. To address these challenges, we present Orchid, a system that gives its users affordances to specify, reference, and monitor context throughout evolving workflows. Specifically, Orchid enables users to (1) specify context related to the project, themselves, and different styles, (2) reference these via explicit mentions, inline selection, or implicit grounding, and (3) monitor context assigned to different interactions across the workflow. In a within-subjects study (n=12), participants using Orchid to execute creative tasks (compared to a baseline toolkit of web search, LLM-based chat, and digital notebooks) produced more novel and feasible outcomes, reporting greater alignment between their intent and the AI's responses, higher perceived control, and increased transparency. By prioritizing context orchestration, Orchid offers an actionable step toward next generation GenAI tools that support complex, iterative workflows - enabling creators and AI to stay aligned and augment their creative potential.

**Result:** PersoNo significantly reduces false negative rates (0.381) compared to baseline models while providing a user-centric approach to notification management.

**Limitations:** The study involved a limited sample size of 18 participants, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

**Conclusion:** The development of PersoNo adheres to Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence design principles, fostering user understanding and control over notification management.

**Abstract:** Mixed Reality (MR) is increasingly integrated into daily life, providing enhanced capabilities across various domains. However, users face growing notification streams that disrupt their immersive experience. We present PersoNo, a personalised notification urgency classifier for MR that intelligently classifies notifications based on individual user preferences. Through a user study (N=18), we created the first MR notification dataset containing both self-labelled and interaction-based data across activities with varying cognitive demands. Our thematic analysis revealed that, unlike in mobiles, the activity context is equally important as the content and the sender in determining notification urgency in MR. Leveraging these insights, we developed PersoNo using large language models that analyse users replying behaviour patterns. Our multi-agent approach achieved 81.5% accuracy and significantly reduced false negative rates (0.381) compared to baseline models. PersoNo has the potential not only to reduce unnecessary interruptions but also to offer users understanding and control of the system, adhering to Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence design principles.

**Result:** The user study indicated that the proposed method significantly enhances the realism and expressivity of haptic feedback, improving user experience during interactions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Haptic Tracing shows promise for developing more complex and realistic haptic experiences, with potential applications in varied interactive environments.

**Abstract:** Haptic technology enhances interactive experiences by providing force and tactile feedback, improving user performance and immersion. However, despite advancements, creating tactile experiences still remains challenging due to device diversity and complexity. Most available haptic frameworks rely on trigger-based or event-based systems, and disregard the information of the 3D scene to render haptic information. This paper introduces Haptic Tracing, a novel method for spatial haptic rendering that simplifies the creation of interactive haptic experiences without relying on physical simulations. It uses concepts from visual and audio rendering to model and propagate haptic information through a 3D scene. The paper also describes how our proposed haptic rendering method can be used to create a vibrotactile rendering system, enabling the creation of perceptually coherent and dynamic haptic interactions. Finally, the paper discusses a user study that explores the role of the haptic propagation and multi-actuator rendering on the users' haptic experience. The results show that our approach significantly enhances the realism and the expressivity of the haptic feedback, showcasing its potential for developing more complex and realistic haptic experiences.

**TL;DR:** This research presents a novel framework integrating a VR environment and AI system for efficient product design, demonstrating significant improvements in design quality and process efficiency.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Conventional product design is cognitively demanding and time-consuming, often relying on subjective expertise.

**Method:** The paper introduces EUPHORIA, a VR environment using eye-tracking to capture aesthetic preferences, and RETINA, an AI system that translates these preferences into design outputs, validated through a comparative study.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the EUPHORIA-RETINA framework for design efficiency
	2. Empirical validation of the framework's effectiveness
	3. Shift from CAD to DAC in product design processes

**Result:** The EUPHORIA-RETINA workflow was over 4 times more time-efficient than conventional methods and received superior quality scores from a panel of design experts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This research marks a paradigm shift from traditional CAD to a Designer-Assisting Computers model, enhancing workflow efficiency and design quality through AI.

**Abstract:** Conventional product design is a cognitively demanding process, limited by its time-consuming nature, reliance on subjective expertise, and the opaque translation of inspiration into tangible concepts. This research introduces a novel, attention-aware framework that integrates two synergistic systems: EUPHORIA, an immersive Virtual Reality environment using eye-tracking to implicitly capture a designer's aesthetic preferences, and RETINA, an agentic AI pipeline that translates these implicit preferences into concrete design outputs. The foundational principles were validated in a two-part study. An initial study correlated user's implicit attention with explicit preference and the next one correlated mood to attention. A comparative study where 4 designers solved challenging design problems using 4 distinct workflows, from a manual process to an end-to-end automated pipeline, showed the integrated EUPHORIA-RETINA workflow was over 4 times more time-efficient than the conventional method. A panel of 50 design experts evaluated the 16 final renderings. Designs generated by the fully automated system consistently received the highest Worthiness (calculated by an inverse Plackett-Luce model based on gradient descent optimization) and Design Effectiveness scores, indicating superior quality across 8 criteria: novelty, visual appeal, emotional resonance, clarity of purpose, distinctiveness of silhouette, implied materiality, proportional balance, & adherence to the brief. This research presents a validated paradigm shift from traditional Computer-Assisted Design (CAD) to a collaborative model of Designer-Assisting Computers (DAC). By automating logistical and skill-dependent generative tasks, the proposed framework elevates the designer's role to that of a creative director, synergizing human intuition with the generative power of agentic AI to produce higher-quality designs more efficiently.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of current social media platforms that categorize interactions into either small isolated groups or large public spaces.

**Method:** A mobile application was developed, and a ten-day field study was conducted with 36 participants to observe the dynamics of content sharing and curation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Burst social media design
	2. Implementation as a mobile application
	3. Field study demonstrating participatory curation culture

**Result:** The study shows that Burst enabled a culture of participatory curation among users, allowing effective content routing to suitable audiences.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a small participant pool and short duration, which may affect generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest new design directions for social media that enhance user interaction and content sharing.

**Abstract:** Positive social interactions can occur in groups of many shapes and sizes, spanning from small and private to large and open. However, social media tends to binarize our experiences into either isolated small groups or into large public squares. In this paper, we introduce Burst, a social media design that allows users to share and curate content between many spaces of varied size and composition. Users initially post content to small trusted groups, who can then burst that content, routing it to the groups that would be the best audience. We instantiate this approach into a mobile phone application, and demonstrate through a ten-day field study (N=36) that Burst enabled a participatory curation culture. With this work, we aim to articulate potential new design directions for social media sharing.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** affective interaction, biophilic design, emotional experiences, smart buildings, spatial diversity

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper explores affective interaction in built environments, focusing on biophilic design and its impact on emotional experiences in smart buildings.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Traditional affective computing approaches neglect the dynamic aspects of emotions in built environments. This study aims to highlight the role of biophilic design in shaping affective interactions.

**Method:** Interviews with architects were conducted to investigate how biophilic design influences emotional connections in smart buildings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced three design principles for affective interaction in smart buildings.
	2. Highlighted the significance of biophilic design in emotional experiences.
	3. Proposed challenges for integrating affective perspectives into built environments.

**Result:** Natural environments promote self-directed emotional experiences, identified through spatial diversity, embodied friction, and sensory exchanges.

**Limitations:** Further research is needed on practical implementation of these principles.

**Conclusion:** Three design principles for affective interaction in built environments are proposed, emphasizing the need for integrating emotional perspectives in architectural design.

**Abstract:** The perspectives of affective interaction in built environments are largely overlooked and instead dominated by affective computing approaches that view emotions as "static", computable states to be detected and regulated. To address this limitation, we interviewed architects to explore how biophilic design -- our deep-rooted emotional connection with nature -- could shape affective interaction design in smart buildings. Our findings reveal that natural environments facilitate self-directed emotional experiences through spatial diversity, embodied friction, and porous sensory exchanges. Based on this, we introduce three design principles for discussion at the Affective Interaction workshop: (1) Diversity of Spatial Experiences, (2) Self-Reflection Through Complexity & Friction, and (3) Permeability & Sensory Exchange with the Outside World, while also examining the challenges of integrating these perspectives into built environments.

### [16] [Socially Interactive Agents for Preserving and Transferring Tacit Knowledge in Organizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19942)

*Martin Benderoth, Patrick Gebhard, Christian Keller, C. Benjamin Nakhosteen, Stefan Schaffer, Tanja Schneeberger*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Socially Interactive Agents, Tacit Knowledge, Large Language Models, Knowledge Transfer, Ethics in AI

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs) as a scalable solution for transferring tacit knowledge in organizations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional human-facilitated knowledge transfer methods that are resource-intensive and lack scalability.

**Method:** The paper discusses the use of SIAs, which leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to engage users through natural language dialogues and facilitate knowledge externalization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Socially Interactive Agents for knowledge transfer
	2. Use of LLMs, RAG, and CoT prompting to enhance user interactions
	3. Identification of ethical and operational challenges associated with AI-driven knowledge facilitation

**Result:** SIAs can effectively support applications such as onboarding and knowledge retention by conducting structured dialogues to elicit tacit knowledge from employees, provided that issues of trust, ethics, and data privacy are properly managed.

**Limitations:** Challenges include ensuring data privacy, addressing algorithmic bias, and overcoming resistance to AI tools in the workplace.

**Conclusion:** The success of SIAs in facilitating tacit knowledge transfer relies on creating trust and addressing ethical challenges while leveraging advanced AI techniques.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the challenges of preserving and transferring tacit knowledge--deep, experience-based insights that are hard to articulate but vital for decision-making, innovation, and problem-solving. Traditional methods rely heavily on human facilitators, which, while effective, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. A promising alternative is the use of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs) as AI-driven knowledge transfer facilitators. These agents interact autonomously and socially intelligently with users through multimodal behaviors (verbal, paraverbal, nonverbal), simulating expert roles in various organizational contexts. SIAs engage employees in empathic, natural-language dialogues, helping them externalize insights that might otherwise remain unspoken. Their success hinges on building trust, as employees are often hesitant to share tacit knowledge without assurance of confidentiality and appreciation. Key technologies include Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating context-relevant dialogue, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate organizational knowledge, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide structured reflection. These enable SIAs to actively elicit knowledge, uncover implicit assumptions, and connect insights to broader organizational contexts. Potential applications span onboarding, where SIAs support personalized guidance and introductions, and knowledge retention, where they conduct structured interviews with retiring experts to capture heuristics behind decisions. Success depends on addressing ethical and operational challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance to AI. Transparency, robust validation, and a culture of trust are essential to mitigate these risks.

	2. Empowerment of viewers to personalize captions
	3. Identification of trade-offs in caption effectiveness and viewer engagement

**Result:** Evaluations showed that CapTune supports caption creators' control and enhances viewer engagement, revealing trade-offs between information richness and cognitive load.

**Limitations:** The system's effectiveness may vary based on individual viewer preferences and experiences.

**Conclusion:** CapTune provides a framework for effective non-speech caption customization that considers both creator intent and viewer preferences, highlighting the complexity of caption design.

**Abstract:** Non-speech captions are essential to the video experience of deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) viewers, yet conventional approaches often overlook the diversity of their preferences. We present CapTune, a system that enables customization of non-speech captions based on DHH viewers' needs while preserving creator intent. CapTune allows caption authors to define safe transformation spaces using concrete examples and empowers viewers to personalize captions across four dimensions: level of detail, expressiveness, sound representation method, and genre alignment. Evaluations with seven caption creators and twelve DHH participants showed that CapTune supported creators' creative control while enhancing viewers' emotional engagement with content. Our findings also reveal trade-offs between information richness and cognitive load, tensions between interpretive and descriptive representations of sound, and the context-dependent nature of caption preferences.

**Conclusion:** GPT-5 presents as a more capable tool than GPT-4, particularly in education and clinical contexts, emphasizing its potential for domain-specific applications.

**Abstract:** The accelerated evolution of large language models has raised questions about their comparative performance across domains of practical importance. GPT-4 by OpenAI introduced advances in reasoning, multimodality, and task generalization, establishing itself as a valuable tool in education, clinical diagnosis, and academic writing, though it was accompanied by several flaws. Released in August 2025, GPT-5 incorporates a system-of-models architecture designed for task-specific optimization and, based on both anecdotal accounts and emerging evidence from the literature, demonstrates stronger performance than its predecessor in medical contexts. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons of GPT-4 and GPT-5 using human raters from linguistics and clinical fields. Twenty experts evaluated model-generated outputs across five domains: lesson planning, assignment evaluation, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, based on predefined criteria. Mixed-effects models revealed that GPT-5 significantly outperformed GPT-4 in lesson planning, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, while both models performed comparably in assignment assessment. The findings highlight the potential of GPT-5 to serve as a context-sensitive and domain-specialized tool, offering tangible benefits for education, clinical practice, and academic research, while also advancing ethical reasoning. These results contribute to one of the earliest empirical evaluations of the evolving capabilities and practical promise of GPT-5.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** A new model called MultiPL-MoE is proposed to enhance multilingual code generation by improving LLM performance while managing limited computational resources.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of generating code in multiple programming languages with LLMs is significant, and existing solutions are inadequate given computational constraints.

**Method:** The proposed MultiPL-MoE utilizes a hybrid mixture of experts to optimize expert selection at token and segment levels, employing a sliding window mechanism and top-k expert selection for segments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MultiPL-MoE for multilingual code generation
	2. Optimization of expert selection at token and segment levels
	3. Innovative designs for segment-level expert routing

**Result:** Experiments demonstrated that MultiPL-MoE effectively enhances the functionality of LLMs in multilingual code generation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach shows promise in improving multilingual programming capabilities of LLMs within limited computational resources.

**Abstract:** Despite LLMs' excellent code creation capabilities, multilingual code generation remains extremely challenging. To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) when mixing Vietnamese and English pronunciations due to the unique phonetic systems of each language.

**Method:** A novel approach that constructs a representative bilingual phoneme set and employs an end-to-end system using the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for improved phoneme recognition.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Construction of a bilingual phoneme set for Vietnamese and English.
	2. Development of an end-to-end recognition system utilizing the PhoWhisper encoder.

**Result:** The proposed method significantly improves recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese and offers a robust framework for handling tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work not only enhances phoneme recognition accuracy in bilingual contexts but also contributes a framework adaptable to other language pairs with phonetic differences.

**Abstract:** Cross-lingual phoneme recognition has emerged as a significant challenge for accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) when mixing Vietnamese and English pronunciations. Unlike many languages, Vietnamese relies on tonal variations to distinguish word meanings, whereas English features stress patterns and non-standard pronunciations that hinder phoneme alignment between the two languages. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bilingual speech recognition approach with two primary contributions: (1) constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set that bridges the differences between Vietnamese and English phonetic systems; (2) designing an end-to-end system that leverages the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level representations to improve phoneme recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese but also provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an extension of the RetoMaton framework, introducing a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) for enhancing the reliability and transparency of reasoning in large language models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the reliability and interpretability of reasoning tasks in LLMs, which are currently hindered by fragile prompting methods.

**Method:** The authors replace the global datastore in RetoMaton with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) that is constructed from external domain corpora, allowing for robust and context-aware retrieval.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) to improve reasoning in LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of performance improvements in reasoning tasks (TriviaQA, GSM8K, MMLU) using the local RetoMaton variant.
	3. Provision of transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics compared to traditional prompting.

**Result:** The local WFA structure leads to consistent performance improvements over baseline models and traditional prompting methods in reasoning tasks across various pretrained LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach demonstrates a path toward more trustworthy and interpretable reasoning capabilities in LLMs through automaton-guided memory strategies.

**Abstract:** Prompt-based reasoning strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) have become widely used for eliciting reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA), constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K (multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. Our results highlight a promising shift toward trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs via lightweight, automaton-guided memory.

**Conclusion:** Effective benchmarking of LLMs using simulated dialogues enhances the evaluation of their factual accuracy and conversational capabilities.

**Abstract:** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important aspect of conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) when factually correct information is important. LLMs may provide answers that appear correct, but could contain hallucinated information. Thus, building benchmarks that can evaluate LLMs on multi-turn RAG conversations has become an increasingly important task. Simulating real-world conversations is vital for producing high quality evaluation benchmarks. We present RAGAPHENE, a chat-based annotation platform that enables annotators to simulate real-world conversations for benchmarking and evaluating LLMs. RAGAPHENE has been successfully used by approximately 40 annotators to build thousands of real-world conversations.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This thesis explores the use of verbal autopsy narratives for automating cause of death classification using pretrained language models and machine learning, showing superior performance to traditional question-only methods, particularly in non-communicable diseases.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** In contexts lacking civil registration, verbal autopsy is vital for estimating causes of death and informing health policies. Automating this process can enhance its efficiency and accuracy.

**Method:** The study employs pretrained language models and machine learning techniques to classify causes of death using narratives from verbal autopsies, complemented by exploration of multimodal fusion strategies that combine narratives with structured questions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the efficacy of narratives in verbal autopsy for cause of death classification using PLMs.
	2. Introduced multimodal fusion strategies that integrate narrative and question data for improved classification accuracy.
	3. Characterized variations in physician-perceived information sufficiency and its influence on classification outcomes.

**Result:** Transformer-based models with fine-tuning based on narratives outperform existing methods using only structured questions. Multimodal approaches show further improvements in classification performance, particularly beneficial for non-communicable diseases.

**Limitations:** Findings are based on data from a single country (South Africa), which may limit generalizability.

**Conclusion:** The findings illuminate the critical role of narrative data in enhancing automated cause of death classification and highlight the necessity for high-quality training data across diverse settings.

**Abstract:** In countries without civil registration and vital statistics, verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating cause of death (COD) and inform policy priorities. In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the circumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and structured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms only use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this thesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD classification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that with the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning outperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and population levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We explore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions in unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD classification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may capture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also characterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe variations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that classification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and models. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the intersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health. It demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification. Our findings underscore the need for more high-quality data from more diverse settings to use in training and fine-tuning PLM/ML methods, and offer valuable insights to guide the rethinking and redesign of the VA instrument and interview.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** CORE is a novel method for lossless context compression in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), optimizing the compression process using reinforcement learning to enhance LLM performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current RAG methods face challenges with excessive input lengths and performance degradation due to fixed heuristics in document compression, necessitating a more effective approach.

**Method:** CORE uses reinforcement learning, specifically Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO), to optimize compression without relying on predefined compression labels, using end-task performance as a reward signal.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CORE for lossless context compression in RAG
	2. Utilization of reinforcement learning for optimizing compression goals
	3. Demonstrated performance improvements with experimental validation across multiple datasets

**Result:** CORE achieves a compression ratio of 3%, avoiding performance degradation while improving the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points across various datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The extensive experimental results validate CORE's effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy of responses generated by LLMs while maintaining a high compression ratio.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the timeliness of knowledge and the factual accuracy of responses in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and applies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points.

**Result:** CASC reduces token count and cognitive load for LLMs, transforming complex information into structured context, and outperforms strong baselines in experiments on the SciDocs-QA dataset.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CASC effectively mitigates issues of information overload in multi-document contexts, enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks but are prone to hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these by grounding LLMs in external knowledge. However, in complex domains involving multiple, lengthy, or conflicting documents, traditional RAG suffers from information overload and inefficient synthesis, leading to inaccurate and untrustworthy answers. To address this, we propose CASC (Context-Adaptive Synthesis and Compression), a novel framework that intelligently processes retrieved contexts. CASC introduces a Context Analyzer & Synthesizer (CAS) module, powered by a fine-tuned smaller LLM, which performs key information extraction, cross-document consistency checking and conflict resolution, and question-oriented structured synthesis. This process transforms raw, scattered information into a highly condensed, structured, and semantically rich context, significantly reducing the token count and cognitive load for the final Reader LLM. We evaluate CASC on SciDocs-QA, a new challenging multi-document question answering dataset designed for complex scientific domains with inherent redundancies and conflicts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CASC consistently outperforms strong baselines.

**TL;DR:** ARIS is a hybrid Event Extraction approach combining discriminative models and LLMs to improve prediction quality and recall.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address limited recall in traditional models and the issues of hallucination in generative models for event extraction in unstructured text.

**Method:** A hybrid approach using a Self Mixture of Agents, a discriminative sequence tagger, and an LLM reflective inference module to enhance event prediction quality.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposal of ARIS for event extraction
	2. Integration of confidence-based filtering and LLM reflective inference
	3. Investigated decomposed instruction fine-tuning for LLMs

**Result:** ARIS outperforms existing state-of-the-art event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets, improving both precision and recall.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study indicates that combining structured model consensus with LLM capabilities can significantly enhance event extraction performance.

**Abstract:** Event Extraction (EE) involves automatically identifying and extracting structured information about events from unstructured text, including triggers, event types, and arguments. Traditional discriminative models demonstrate high precision but often exhibit limited recall, particularly for nuanced or infrequent events. Conversely, generative approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) provide higher semantic flexibility and recall but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent predictions. To address these challenges, we propose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach combining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger. ARIS explicitly leverages structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering, and an LLM reflective inference module to reliably resolve ambiguities and enhance overall event prediction quality. We further investigate decomposed instruction fine-tuning for enhanced LLM event extraction understanding. Experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.

**TL;DR:** LongReasonArena benchmark evaluates long reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through multi-step algorithm tasks.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of benchmarks assessing long reasoning abilities in LLMs, which are distinct from mere comprehension of long inputs.

**Method:** Introduction of LongReasonArena, a benchmark designed to scale reasoning tasks with varying lengths, up to 1 million tokens, requiring multi-step algorithms.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark for long reasoning abilities in LLMs.
	2. Tasks include multi-step problem-solving algorithms such as retrieval and backtracking.
	3. Extensive evaluation results highlighting the performance gap of existing LLMs.

**Result:** Evaluation results show that LLMs, including Deepseek-R1, struggle significantly with the benchmark, with Deepseek-R1 achieving only 7.5% accuracy.

**Limitations:** The benchmark focuses exclusively on reasoning capabilities and may not cover all dimensions of LLM performance or real-world applicability.

**Conclusion:** LongReasonArena effectively challenges the reasoning abilities of LLMs, indicating a substantial gap in their performance on long reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Existing long-context benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on evaluating comprehension of long inputs, while overlooking the evaluation of long reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce LongReasonArena, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the long reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our tasks require models to solve problems by executing multi-step algorithms that reflect key aspects of long reasoning, such as retrieval and backtracking. By controlling the inputs, the required reasoning length can be arbitrarily scaled, reaching up to 1 million tokens of reasoning for the most challenging tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for both open-source and proprietary LLMs. For instance, Deepseek-R1 achieves only 7.5% accuracy on our task. Further analysis also reveals that the accuracy exhibits a linear decline with respect to the logarithm of the expected number of reasoning steps.

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of Database Entity Recognition (DB-ER) in Natural Language Queries (NLQ). We present several key contributions to advance this field: (1) a human-annotated benchmark for DB-ER task, derived from popular text-to-sql benchmarks, (2) a novel data augmentation procedure that leverages automatic annotation of NLQs based on the corresponding SQL queries which are available in popular text-to-SQL benchmarks, (3) a specialized language model based entity recognition model using T5 as a backbone and two down-stream DB-ER tasks: sequence tagging and token classification for fine-tuning of backend and performing DB-ER respectively. We compared our DB-ER tagger with two state-of-the-art NER taggers, and observed better performance in both precision and recall for our model. The ablation evaluation shows that data augmentation boosts precision and recall by over 10%, while fine-tuning of the T5 backbone boosts these metrics by 5-10%.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**Read time:** 7 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding if competence in certain humor tasks allows transfer to new, unseen types, especially in the context of the evolving digital humor landscape.

**Method:** Conducted transfer learning experiments across four datasets focused on different humor tasks, training LLMs with varied dataset diversity and testing on novel tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of humor transferability in LLMs across different tasks
	2. Identification of training diversity's role in enhancing transferability
	3. Release of datasets and code for further research on humor computing.

**Result:** Models achieved up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets, with diversity in training data facilitating a slight improvement in transferability without compromising in-domain performance.

**Limitations:** Results may vary with different humor types not covered in the study or with different model architectures.

**Conclusion:** LLMs can somewhat generalize humor across tasks, with certain types like Dad Jokes being both beneficial and challenging for transfer.

**Abstract:** Humor is a broad and complex form of communication that remains challenging for machines. Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work, we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes, anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing different humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3 datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%) with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests relations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best enabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and code.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Historical analysis of writing ability losses

**Conclusion:** If current trends continue, there may be a significant reduction in human writing capabilities, similar to historical periods of diminished literacy.

**Abstract:** The 2020s have been witnessing a very significant advance in the development of generative artificial intelligence tools, including text generation systems based on large language models. These tools have been increasingly used to generate texts in the most diverse domains -- from technical texts to literary texts --, which might eventually lead to a lower volume of written text production by humans. This article discusses the possibility of a future in which human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines. This possibility parallels the loss of the ability to write in other moments of human history, such as during the so-called Greek Dark Ages (approx. 1200 BCE - 800 BCE).

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a system for ontology construction using LLMs, focusing on term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery, achieving top-ranking results in the LLMs4OL 2025 challenge.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the need for effective ontology construction methods, aiming to enhance the scalability and adaptability of LLM-based solutions across various domains.

**Method:** The authors employ a combination of retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling for three distinct tasks of ontology construction: term extraction, type assignment, and taxonomy discovery.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for term extraction.
	2. A dual strategy for type assignment utilizing both few-shot and zero-shot approaches.
	3. Development of a lightweight cross-attention model for taxonomy discovery.

**Result:** The proposed system achieved top-ranking results in the official leaderboard of the LLMs4OL 2025 challenge by leveraging a modular approach for each task, enhancing performance without the need for extensive model fine-tuning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The strategies outlined in the paper demonstrate the viability of LLM architectures for robust and scalable ontology learning, providing promising solutions for future applications.

**Abstract:** We present a comprehensive system for addressing Tasks A, B, and C of the LLMs4OL 2025 challenge, which together span the full ontology construction pipeline: term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery. Our approach combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels, we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across heterogeneous domains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoLAP for multilingual NLP

**Conclusion:** CoLAP effectively narrows the performance gap in multilingual NLP, contributing to more efficient techniques in the field.

**Abstract:** The disparity in language resources poses a challenge in multilingual NLP, with high-resource languages benefiting from extensive data, while low-resource languages lack sufficient data for effective training. Our Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) method addresses this gap by integrating contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations, facilitating task-specific knowledge transfer from high-resource to lower-resource languages. The primary advantage of our approach is its data efficiency, enabling rapid adaptation to new languages and reducing the need for large labeled datasets. We conduct experiments with multilingual encoder-only and decoder-only language models on natural language understanding tasks, including natural language inference and relation extraction, evaluating performance across both high- and low-resource languages. Our results demonstrate that CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context learning, even with limited available data. This effectively narrows the cross-lingual performance gap, contributing to the development of more efficient multilingual NLP techniques.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The urgent public health challenge of nonmedical opioid use and its underreported consequences necessitates innovative approaches to gather insights, particularly from candid social media narratives.

**Method:** A named entity recognition framework is developed to extract ClinicalImpacts and SocialImpacts from Reddit narratives. The study introduces the refined RedditImpacts 2.0 dataset and evaluates fine-tuned encoder-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RedditImpacts 2.0 dataset with refined annotations for better data quality
	2. Demonstration of effective NER framework for opioid-related social media narratives
	3. Analysis of model performance under different learning settings, emphasizing practical deployment in healthcare contexts

**Result:** The fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model achieved a token-level F1 score of 0.61, outperforming LLMs in several metrics. The study highlights the potential for robust NER performance with less labeled data.

**Limitations:** The best performing model still does not match inter-expert agreement, indicating a gap in current AI capabilities in deep domain knowledge tasks.

**Conclusion:** Strong domain-specific fine-tuning can significantly enhance clinical NLP task performance, although current models still lag behind expert agreement in understanding complex medical narratives.

**Abstract:** Nonmedical opioid use is an urgent public health challenge, with far-reaching clinical and social consequences that are often underreported in traditional healthcare settings. Social media platforms, where individuals candidly share first-person experiences, offer a valuable yet underutilized source of insight into these impacts. In this study, we present a named entity recognition (NER) framework to extract two categories of self-reported consequences from social media narratives related to opioid use: ClinicalImpacts (e.g., withdrawal, depression) and SocialImpacts (e.g., job loss). To support this task, we introduce RedditImpacts 2.0, a high-quality dataset with refined annotation guidelines and a focus on first-person disclosures, addressing key limitations of prior work. We evaluate both fine-tuned encoder-based models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) under zero- and few-shot in-context learning settings. Our fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model achieves a relaxed token-level F1 of 0.61 [95% CI: 0.43-0.62], consistently outperforming LLMs in precision, span accuracy, and adherence to task-specific guidelines. Furthermore, we show that strong NER performance can be achieved with substantially less labeled data, emphasizing the feasibility of deploying robust models in resource-limited settings. Our findings underscore the value of domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical NLP tasks and contribute to the responsible development of AI tools that may enhance addiction surveillance, improve interpretability, and support real-world healthcare decision-making. The best performing model, however, still significantly underperforms compared to inter-expert agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.81), demonstrating that a gap persists between expert intelligence and current state-of-the-art NER/AI capabilities for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.

**Abstract:** \Abstract{In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal significance as imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}

**Motivation:** Address challenges in low-resource machine translation for large language models that struggle with limited exposure and data.

**Method:** Integrates an external bilingual dictionary into the translation process and employs reinforcement learning alongside supervised fine-tuning, framing translation as an augmented decision-making problem.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel tool-augmented decision-making framework for translation
	2. Integration of reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning
	3. Demonstration of significant BLEU score improvements through experimental validation.

**Result:** Achieved a BLEU score improvement of up to +3.37 and an 18% relative gain over a supervised baseline without dictionary access on the test set.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The combination of LLMs with external tools and reinforcement learning shows significant potential for enhancing translation quality in low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Low-resource machine translation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack exposure to these languages during pretraining and have limited parallel data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel approach that enhances translation for low-resource languages by integrating an external dictionary tool and training models end-to-end using reinforcement learning, in addition to supervised fine-tuning. Focusing on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented decision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual dictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning with Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both when and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as rewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our tool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work, and a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary access, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared Task. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the effects of model architecture and training strategy, comparing Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with other models such as LLaMA and a prior NLLB-based system. These findings highlight the promise of combining LLMs with external tools and the role of reinforcement learning in improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered tutor
	2. Modeling emotions from both text and facial expressions
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements in tutoring effectiveness

**Result:** Significant performance improvements were observed, with a 23 point gain in win rates and a 3 point increase in overall pedagogical effectiveness according to DAMR scores.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Modeling students' emotions enhances the effectiveness of LLM-based tutors in educational settings, leading to more empathetic and effective learning experiences.

**Abstract:** The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already transforming the landscape of educational technology. However, the current state-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's affective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim that positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's emotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions and user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win rate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly supports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by modeling students' emotions.

**Motivation:** To assess how LLMs reason about dynamic environments and rule interactions in games, identifying strengths and weaknesses in their understanding.

**Method:** We introduce a dataset of card synergies from Slay the Spire, categorizing card pairs into positive, negative, or neutral interactions, and evaluate LLMs’ performance in identifying these synergies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel dataset for analyzing card synergies in games
	2. Identification of LLM strengths and weaknesses in reasoning about game rules
	3. Cataloging common error types in LLM interactions with dynamic game environments

**Result:** While LLMs are proficient in recognizing non-synergistic card pairs, they show deficiencies in detecting positive and negative synergies, particularly struggling to handle timing and game state definitions.

**Limitations:** The analysis is limited to a single game context and may not fully generalize to other domains or types of games.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights key error types and suggests potential research directions to enhance LLM performance in predicting rule effects and interactions in games.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of domains, including logical reasoning, mathematics, and more. In this paper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule interactions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs, they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and their interactions.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Diffusion models, supervised fine-tuning, text generation, blockwise decoding, stochastic masking

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** Proposes Blockwise SFT for improving text generation in diffusion language models by aligning training with the decoding process.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Standard supervised fine-tuning misaligns with the semi-autoregressive inference of discrete diffusion models, leading to biases in text generation.

**Method:** Blockwise SFT partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block for stochastic masking, freezes previous tokens, and hides future ones, thus computing loss only over the active block.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Blockwise SFT for diffusion models
	2. Demonstrated improvements in text generation performance
	3. Alignment of training and inference processes for better outcomes.

**Result:** Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA demonstrate consistent performance improvements over classical SFT with the new method.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Matching the supervision granularity to the decoding procedure is crucial for enhancing the performance of diffusion language models.

**Abstract:** Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.

However, improving performance in code-related tasks remains challenging due to limited training data that is verifiable with accurate test cases. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise, existing methods for generating test cases still face limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that splits code snippets into smaller, granular blocks, creating more diverse DPO pairs from the same test cases. Additionally, we introduce the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) splitting and curriculum training method to enhance the DPO training. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in code generation tasks, as validated by experiments on benchmark datasets such as HumanEval (+), MBPP (+), APPS, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench.

**Motivation:** To address the lack of consensus on emotion classification in psychology and improve emotion recognition in real-world applications where unseen emotions occur.

**Method:** ProEmoTrans leverages a prototype-based approach with an LLM-enhanced description method for defining implicit emotions, a parameter-free mechanism for efficient utterance encoding, and an improved Attention Viterbi Decoding method for emotion transfer.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Unseen Emotion Recognition in Conversation (UERC) task.

	3. Innovative methods for implicit emotion definition, efficient encoding, and emotion transition transfer.

**Result:** The proposed framework shows strong baseline performance in experiments conducted on three datasets, highlighting its potential in the new area of UERC.

**Limitations:** The framework still faces challenges with implicit expressions and the complexity of encoding long conversations.

**Conclusion:** ProEmoTrans fulfills initial exploratory needs for recognizing unseen emotions in conversations, paving the way for further research in ERC.

**Abstract:** Current Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) research follows a closed-domain assumption. However, there is no clear consensus on emotion classification in psychology, which presents a challenge for models when it comes to recognizing previously unseen emotions in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unseen Emotion Recognition in Conversation (UERC) task for the first time and propose ProEmoTrans, a solid prototype-based emotion transfer framework. This prototype-based approach shows promise but still faces key challenges: First, implicit expressions complicate emotion definition, which we address by proposing an LLM-enhanced description approach. Second, utterance encoding in long conversations is difficult, which we tackle with a proposed parameter-free mechanism for efficient encoding and overfitting prevention. Finally, the Markovian flow nature of emotions is hard to transfer, which we address with an improved Attention Viterbi Decoding (AVD) method to transfer seen emotion transitions to unseen emotions. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method serves as a strong baseline for preliminary exploration in this new area.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, and to highlight the alignment problems posed by conflicting goals in exploiting these ambiguities.

**Method:** Designs scenarios with LLMs given a goal and an ambiguous instruction, measuring their ability to exploit loopholes created by ambiguities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel framework for testing LLM responses to ambiguous instructions.
	2. Identifies potential AI safety risks related to loophole exploitation in LLMs.
	3. Demonstrates the ability of models to reason about conflicting goals and ambiguities.

**Result:** Both closed-source and strong open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit loopholes, revealing a potential AI safety risk.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Models that exploit ambiguity explicitly identify and reason about conflicting goals and ambiguities, raising concerns regarding AI alignment and safety.

**Abstract:** Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.

**Motivation:** To evaluate the long-context comprehension of LLMs efficiently and effectively, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods.

**Method:** The framework organizes source texts into a three-level hierarchy and utilizes query-focused summarization to assess information recall and representation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a structured three-level key-fact hierarchy for evaluating comprehension in LLMs
	2. Achievement of high alignment with human evaluations through an automated process
	3. Public availability of the code and dataset for further research

**Result:** The method demonstrated over 90% agreement with expert human judgments while reducing evaluation costs significantly.

**Limitations:** The framework may not account for all nuances of comprehension, especially under varying contexts.

**Conclusion:** HAMLET illustrates LLMs' difficulties with fine-grained comprehension and demonstrates significant performance disparities between different types of models and tasks.

**Abstract:** We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/HAMLET.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the ArgCMV dataset
	2. Identification of limitations in existing datasets like ArgKP21

**Result:** Demonstrated that existing key point extraction methods do not adapt well to the new ArgCMV dataset, highlighting its increased complexity.

**Limitations:** The paper does not provide extensive evaluations of how to improve existing methods for the new dataset.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of ArgCMV sets the stage for advancements in LLM-driven summarization research, especially for online discussions.

**Abstract:** Key point extraction is an important task in argument summarization which involves extracting high-level short summaries from arguments. Existing approaches for KP extraction have been mostly evaluated on the popular ArgKP21 dataset. In this paper, we highlight some of the major limitations of the ArgKP21 dataset and demonstrate the need for new benchmarks that are more representative of actual human conversations. Using SoTA large language models (LLMs), we curate a new argument key point extraction dataset called ArgCMV comprising of around 12K arguments from actual online human debates spread across over 3K topics. Our dataset exhibits higher complexity such as longer, co-referencing arguments, higher presence of subjective discourse units, and a larger range of topics over ArgKP21. We show that existing methods do not adapt well to ArgCMV and provide extensive benchmark results by experimenting with existing baselines and latest open source models. This work introduces a novel KP extraction dataset for long-context online discussions, setting the stage for the next generation of LLM-driven summarization research.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the classification of isolated Arabic letters using wav2vec 2.0 and proposes a neural network to improve accuracy, addressing the challenges posed by co-articulatory cues in Arabic phonetics.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the accuracy of Modern Arabic ASR systems in identifying isolated letters, which is essential for language learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research.

**Method:** The study introduces a diverse corpus of isolated Arabic letters and tests wav2vec 2.0's performance. A lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings is trained, and adversarial training is applied to enhance robustness against noise.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a diacritised corpus for isolated Arabic letters.
	2. Demonstration of wav2vec 2.0 limitations and performance improvements with a lightweight neural network.
	3. Implementation of adversarial training to enhance robustness against noise.

**Result:** Initial accuracy of wav2vec 2.0 is 35%; improvement to 65% with a neural network, but small amplitude perturbation reduces it to 32%. Adversarial training limits the accuracy drop to 9% in noisy conditions.

**Limitations:** The study focuses solely on isolated letters, which may not extrapolate directly to broader ASR tasks without further adjustment.

**Conclusion:** The methods proposed can extend to word- and sentence-level frameworks to improve pronunciation accuracy in ASR systems for Arabic, with shared data and code for reproducibility.

**Abstract:** Modern Arabic ASR systems such as wav2vec 2.0 excel at word- and sentence-level transcription, yet struggle to classify isolated letters. In this study, we show that this phoneme-level task, crucial for language learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research, is challenging because isolated letters lack co-articulatory cues, provide no lexical context, and last only a few hundred milliseconds. Recogniser systems must therefore rely solely on variable acoustic cues, a difficulty heightened by Arabic's emphatic (pharyngealized) consonants and other sounds with no close analogues in many languages. This study introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models achieve only 35% accuracy on it. Training a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. However, adding a small amplitude perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%. To restore robustness, we apply adversarial training, limiting the noisy-speech drop to 9% while preserving clean-speech accuracy. We detail the corpus, training pipeline, and evaluation protocol, and release, on demand, data and code for reproducibility. Finally, we outline future work extending these methods to word- and sentence-level frameworks, where precise letter pronunciation remains critical.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Improving context faithfulness is crucial as large language models often generate responses that are not grounded in the provided context, leading to irrelevant outputs.

**Method:** The proposed method, Router Lens, identifies experts that are specialized in context utilization. CEFT is then used for lightweight optimization of these identified experts to enhance their performance on contextual tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Router Lens for identifying context-faithful experts
	2. Development of Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT) method
	3. Demonstration of improved efficiency and performance in context grounding tasks.

**Result:** CEFT shows enhanced context grounding by fine-tuning context-faithful experts, and achieves performance that matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while being more efficient.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that targeted optimization of context-faithful experts can lead to significant improvements in language model performance in context-dependent scenarios.

**Abstract:** Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependent scenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground their outputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired by the emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-experts architectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibit specialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway toward targeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, we propose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithful experts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplify attention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing context grounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectively fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.

**Motivation:** To improve the adaptability and information updating in large language models by incorporating external knowledge while addressing challenges in applying noise injection in RAG.

**Method:** The authors develop a Layer Fused Decoding (LFD) strategy that combines outputs from intermediate and final layers of LLMs, leveraging an internal knowledge score to identify optimal layers for integration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of noise injection as a useful mechanism in RAG
	2. Proposal of Layer Fused Decoding (LFD) for enhanced knowledge integration
	3. Development of the internal knowledge score (IKS) for layer optimization

**Result:** Experiments show that LFD allows RAG systems to better utilize retrieved contextual knowledge, resulting in improved generation quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LFD demonstrates the potential of strategically leveraging layer outputs in LLMs to enhance retrieval-augmented capabilities with minimal computational cost.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.

**Motivation:** Rapid advancements in LLMs increase the risk of fake news, necessitating more effective detection methods that can adapt to evolving misinformation.

**Method:** SALF utilizes an adversarial training approach where a generation agent creates fake narratives and a detection agent identifies flaws through structured debates, enabling iterative refinement between agents using symbolic learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF) for fake news detection.
	2. Adversarial training paradigm with symbolic learning instead of traditional numerical updates.
	3. Demonstration of significant performance impacts on fake news generation and detection in multiple languages.

**Result:** SALF significantly reduces state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English, while improving detection of refined content by up to 7.7%.

**Limitations:** The framework's reliance on symbolic representations may face challenges in diverse scenarios beyond the tested benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework lays the groundwork for developing more robust fake news detection systems that can adapt to the complexities of modern misinformation.

**Abstract:** Rapid LLM advancements heighten fake news risks by enabling the automatic generation of increasingly sophisticated misinformation. Previous detection methods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often struggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel framework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which implements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning optimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces a paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the detection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws for detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial interactions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using agent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts, and simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural language representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average. SALF also refines detectors, improving detection of refined content by up to 7.7%. We hope our work inspires further exploration into more robust, adaptable fake news detection systems.

**Method:** The framework tunes two small proxy language models and adjusts the output distributions to shift the original distribution of a large LLM.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CSKS framework for LLMs sensitivity adjustment
	2. Utilization of proxy models for efficient knowledge tuning
	3. Development of metrics for measuring sensitivity to contextual knowledge

**Result:** CSKS achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, successfully allowing adjustments to either increase or decrease sensitivity based on the requirements.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CSKS enables flexible prioritization of contextual or parametric knowledge in LLMs, enhancing their application effectiveness.

**Abstract:** In Large Language Models (LLMs) generation, there exist knowledge conflicts and scenarios where parametric knowledge contradicts knowledge provided in the context. Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e. proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

**Abstract:** Existing resources for Automatic Speech Recognition in Portuguese are mostly focused on Brazilian Portuguese, leaving European Portuguese (EP) and other varieties under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce CAM\~OES, the first open framework for EP and other Portuguese varieties. It consists of (1) a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, including 46h of EP test data spanning multiple domains; and (2) a collection of state-of-the-art models. For the latter, we consider multiple foundation models, evaluating their zero-shot and fine-tuned performances, as well as E-Branchformer models trained from scratch. A curated set of 425h of EP was used for both fine-tuning and training. Our results show comparable performance for EP between fine-tuned foundation models and the E-Branchformer. Furthermore, the best-performing models achieve relative improvements above 35% WER, compared to the strongest zero-shot foundation model, establishing a new state-of-the-art for EP and other varieties.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Commonsense Visual-Question Answering, Vision-Language Models, Knowledge Integration

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that enhances small vision-language models (sVLMs) in commonsense visual-question answering by integrating retrieval-based commonsense knowledge and LLM-generated explanations, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of small vision-language models (sVLMs) in commonsense visual-question answering, particularly when they lack necessary knowledge from images or questions.

**Method:** The framework retrieves natural language facts using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2, prompts a LLM for explanations, and combines these signals to enhance the performance of sVLMs across multiple datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the NLKI framework to enhance sVLMs
	2. Demonstrated significant accuracy improvements across commonsense VQA datasets
	3. Showed the effectiveness of noise-robust training methods for small models

**Result:** The integration of retrieved facts and explanations improved end-to-end answer accuracy of sVLMs by up to 7% and reduced hallucinations significantly, matching or exceeding the performance of medium-sized vision-language models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that LLM-based commonsense knowledge is more effective than retrieval from knowledge bases and that noise-aware training methods improve the stability and accuracy of small models when augmented with external knowledge.

**Abstract:** Commonsense visual-question answering often hinges on knowledge that is missing from the image or the question. Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.

**TL;DR:** Spotlight Attention optimizes key-value cache retrieval in Large Language Models by using non-linear hashing methods.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiencies in existing key-value cache retrieval methods during LLM inference, specifically the issues caused by random linear hashing of important tokens.

**Method:** Introduces a non-linear hashing approach to enhance the embedding distribution of queries and keys, along with a lightweight training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Spotlight Attention for key-value retrieval in LLMs
	2. Optimization of non-linear hashing for improved embedding distribution
	3. Development of specialized CUDA kernels for enhanced performance

**Result:** Spotlight Attention demonstrates a 5x reduction in hash code length and significantly improves retrieval precision, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100μs on a single A100 GPU.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method outperforms traditional linear hashing techniques, thereby demonstrating increased efficiency and robustness in Large Language Model decoding.

**Abstract:** Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

**TL;DR:** NEWSCOPE is a two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that improves event coverage by modeling semantic variation at the sentence level, outperforming existing methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the redundancy in news retrieval systems that prioritize textual relevance, limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints.

**Method:** The framework consists of a two-stage process: first retrieving relevant content using dense retrieval, and then applying sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NEWSCOPE framework for diverse news retrieval
	2. Development of three interpretable metrics for evaluating retrieval diversity
	3. Construction of two benchmarks (LocalNews and DSGlobal) for assessment.

**Result:** NEWSCOPE significantly enhances news retrieval diversity and maintains relevance, demonstrated through benchmarks and metrics introduced for evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The effectiveness of NEWSCOPE highlights the importance of fine-grained semantic modeling in promoting diverse event understanding in news retrieval.

**Abstract:** Access to diverse perspectives is essential for understanding real-world events, yet most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading to redundant results and limited viewpoint exposure. We propose NEWSCOPE, a two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that enhances event coverage by explicitly modeling semantic variation at the sentence level. The first stage retrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval, while the second stage applies sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to surface complementary information. To evaluate retrieval diversity, we introduce three interpretable metrics, namely Average Pairwise Distance, Positive Cluster Coverage, and Information Density Ratio, and construct two paragraph-level benchmarks: LocalNews and DSGlobal. Experiments show that NEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly higher diversity without compromising relevance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in mitigating redundancy and promoting comprehensive event understanding.

**TL;DR:** The paper analyzes the effectiveness of expert persona prompting in language models and identifies key factors influencing performance across multiple tasks.

**Read time:** 30 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand when and why expert persona prompting improves task performance in language models, addressing mixed results and emphasizing careful persona design.

**Method:** The authors evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks, focusing on three key desiderata related to persona prompting effectiveness: performance advantage, robustness to irrelevant attributes, and fidelity to persona attributes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of three key desiderata for effective persona prompting
	2. Empirical evaluation of 9 LLMs across 27 tasks
	3. Proposed mitigation strategies for improving robustness of persona usage in LLMs

**Result:** Expert personas generally lead to positive or non-significant performance changes, but the models show sensitivity to irrelevant persona details, resulting in performance drops of almost 30 percentage points. Fidelity factors like higher education and specialization show inconsistent effects on performance.

**Limitations:** Mitigation strategies have limited effectiveness and primarily benefit the largest models, suggesting a need for broader solutions.

**Conclusion:** Careful design and evaluation of personas are essential, as mitigation strategies to enhance robustness only work for the largest models.

**Abstract:** Expert persona prompting -- assigning roles such as expert in math to language models -- is widely used for task improvement. However, prior work shows mixed results on its effectiveness, and does not consider when and why personas should improve performance. We analyze the literature on persona prompting for task improvement and distill three desiderata: 1) performance advantage of expert personas, 2) robustness to irrelevant persona attributes, and 3) fidelity to persona attributes. We then evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks with respect to these desiderata. We find that expert personas usually lead to positive or non-significant performance changes. Surprisingly, models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details, with performance drops of almost 30 percentage points. In terms of fidelity, we find that while higher education, specialization, and domain-relatedness can boost performance, their effects are often inconsistent or negligible across tasks. We propose mitigation strategies to improve robustness -- but find they only work for the largest, most capable models. Our findings underscore the need for more careful persona design and for evaluation schemes that reflect the intended effects of persona usage.

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of transforming table information into reports, which is critical for practical applications but currently underexplored.

**Method:** Developing a bilingual benchmark called T2R-bench that includes 457 industrial tables from various domains and proposing evaluation criteria for report generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the table-to-report task
	2. Creation of the T2R-bench benchmark
	3. Formulation of evaluation criteria for report generation

**Result:** State-of-the-art LLMs showed suboptimal performance on the benchmark, with a maximum score of 62.71 achieved by Deepseek-R1, indicating significant room for improvement.

**Limitations:** The benchmark currently includes 457 tables, which may not cover all possible scenarios in industry.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of T2R-bench provides a necessary tool for better understanding and developing LLMs for the table-to-report task in industrial settings.

**Abstract:** Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench. Source code and data will be available after acceptance.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of stateless LLMs constrained by context windows and to introduce learned mechanisms for memory management.

**Method:** A reinforcement learning framework utilizing two agents: a Memory Manager for structured memory operations and an Answer Agent for selecting relevant entries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a reinforcement learning framework for active memory management in LLMs
	2. Demonstrates strong performance with minimal training data
	3. Provides insights into agentic behaviors in LLMs

**Result:** Memory-R1 outperforms existing competitive baselines and shows strong generalization across various question types with minimal training data.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates how reinforcement learning can enhance LLMs' capabilities for memory management and reasoning, paving the way for more advanced reasoning systems.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and use with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most competitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.

**Result:** The framework achieves a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74 to 0.83 when compared to human expert coders in analyzing 2899 conceptual physics survey responses.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Text embedding-assisted coding can efficiently analyze large datasets while maintaining interpretability, allowing for scalable qualitative analysis.

**Abstract:** Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses is a commonly-used research method in the social sciences, but traditional coding approaches are often time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Existing solutions from Natural Language Processing such as supervised classifiers, topic modeling techniques, and generative large language models have limited applicability in qualitative analysis, since they demand extensive labeled data, disrupt established qualitative workflows, and/or yield variable results. In this paper, we introduce a text embedding-based classification framework that requires only a handful of examples per category and fits well with standard qualitative workflows. When benchmarked against human analysis of a conceptual physics survey consisting of 2899 open-ended responses, our framework achieves a Cohen's Kappa ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 as compared to expert human coders in an exhaustive coding scheme. We further show how performance of this framework improves with fine-tuning of the text embedding model, and how the method can be used to audit previously-analyzed datasets. These findings demonstrate that text embedding-assisted coding can flexibly scale to thousands of responses without sacrificing interpretability, opening avenues for deductive qualitative analysis at scale.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to overcome the limitations of token-based multitasking frameworks like TokenVerse, which require full labeling for effective training.

**Method:** TokenVerse++ integrates learnable vectors in the acoustic embedding space of the XLSR-Transducer ASR model to facilitate dynamic task activation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced learnable vectors for dynamic task activation in ASR
	2. Enabled training with partially annotated datasets
	3. Improved performance on ASR and language identification tasks

**Result:** The model effectively incorporates partially annotated datasets, improving performance for ASR and language identification tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TokenVerse++ demonstrates superior or comparable results to TokenVerse, offering a practical multitask solution without compromising ASR performance.

**Abstract:** Token-based multitasking frameworks like TokenVerse require all training utterances to have labels for all tasks, hindering their ability to leverage partially annotated datasets and scale effectively. We propose TokenVerse++, which introduces learnable vectors in the acoustic embedding space of the XLSR-Transducer ASR model for dynamic task activation. This core mechanism enables training with utterances labeled for only a subset of tasks, a key advantage over TokenVerse. We demonstrate this by successfully integrating a dataset with partial labels, specifically for ASR and an additional task, language identification, improving overall performance. TokenVerse++ achieves results on par with or exceeding TokenVerse across multiple tasks, establishing it as a more practical multitask alternative without sacrificing ASR performance.

**Motivation:** Defining and measuring linguistic difficulty for curriculum learning remains challenging.

**Method:** The paper compares label-based curricula derived from the Simple Wikipedia corpus against competence-based strategies using shallow heuristics in training a BERT-tiny model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of human-curated simple language as a curriculum learning signal.
	2. Demonstration of the effectiveness of structured training versus random ordering.
	3. Findings on the limitations of competence-based curricula.

**Result:** The study found that while simple data alone did not provide clear benefits, incorporating it in a curriculum improved perplexity, especially when used first. Competence-based approaches showed no consistent advantages.

**Limitations:** The results indicate that simple data alone may not suffice without proper structuring in the curriculum.

**Conclusion:** Human intuition regarding linguistic difficulty can effectively inform curriculum learning strategies for pre-training language models.

**Abstract:** Curriculum learning (CL) aims to improve training by presenting data from "easy" to "hard", yet defining and measuring linguistic difficulty remains an open challenge. We investigate whether human-curated simple language can serve as an effective signal for CL. Using the article-level labels from the Simple Wikipedia corpus, we compare label-based curricula to competence-based strategies relying on shallow heuristics. Our experiments with a BERT-tiny model show that adding simple data alone yields no clear benefit. However, structuring it via a curriculum -- especially when introduced first -- consistently improves perplexity, particularly on simple language. In contrast, competence-based curricula lead to no consistent gains over random ordering, probably because they fail to effectively separate the two classes. Our results suggest that human intuition about linguistic difficulty can guide CL for language model pre-training.

**TL;DR:** Evaluation of small language models and pre-trained LLMs for detecting inappropriate use of language in medical instructional materials.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Inappropriate language in medical instructional materials affects clinical training and health outcomes; existing materials often contain outdated terms.

**Method:** Fine-tuned small language models and pre-trained LLMs were tested on a dataset of 500 documents for IUL detection, employing classifiers and hierarchical pipelines for analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a multilabel classifier for inappropriate language detection.
	2. Showed that small language models outperform pre-trained LLMs for this task.
	3. Introduced a training method that improves classification accuracy using unflagged text.

**Result:** The multilabel classifier outperformed LLMs; combining training with unflagged excerpts increased the AUC of classifiers significantly.

**Limitations:** No mention of scalability or applicability to non-medical texts.

**Conclusion:** Small language models are more effective than large language models for identifying inappropriate language in medical curricula, emphasizing the need for better training methods.

**Abstract:** The use of inappropriate language -- such as outdated, exclusionary, or non-patient-centered terms -- medical instructional materials can significantly influence clinical training, patient interactions, and health outcomes. Despite their reputability, many materials developed over past decades contain examples now considered inappropriate by current medical standards. Given the volume of curricular content, manually identifying instances of inappropriate use of language (IUL) and its subcategories for systematic review is prohibitively costly and impractical. To address this challenge, we conduct a first-in-class evaluation of small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data and pre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on a dataset containing approximately 500 documents and over 12,000 pages. For SLMs, we consider: (1) a general IUL classifier, (2) subcategory-specific binary classifiers, (3) a multilabel classifier, and (4) a two-stage hierarchical pipeline for general IUL detection followed by multilabel classification. For LLMs, we consider variations of prompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both LLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed by SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data, supplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for mitigating harmful language in medical curricula.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Bangla-Bayanno is positioned to facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems and strengthen VQA research in Bangla.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce Bangla-Bayanno, an open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA) Dataset in Bangla, a widely used, low-resource language in multimodal AI research. The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for enhancing deductive logical reasoning in large language models using Chain-of-Thought and an echo generation technique to expand training datasets.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of large language models in deductive logical reasoning tasks by developing specialized reward models and enhancing dataset diversity.

**Method:** The authors developed Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) trained on data generated with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and an echo generation technique that reflects incorrect assumptions to produce varied error data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Outcome Reward Models for deductive reasoning
	2. Introduction of echo generation technique for training data augmentation
	3. Demonstrated improved performance across multiple reasoning datasets

**Result:** ORMs trained with both CoT data and echo-augmented data showed improved performance on deductive reasoning tasks, specifically on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets, across various LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods successfully enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models by introducing a richer training dataset and specialized reward models.

**Abstract:** Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.

**Keywords:** Stereotypes, LLM, Multi-agent systems, Bias, Human-AI interaction

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the emergence of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems through simulated workplace interactions, finding that biases develop spontaneously despite neutral initial conditions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate whether AI systems, particularly LLM-based agents, can develop stereotypes during interactions despite not being trained with biased data.

**Method:** A novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions among LLM-based AI agents with neutral initial conditions was used to study stereotype formation and evolution.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated spontaneous stereotype development in LLM-based AI agents during neutral interactions.
	2. Identified the intensification of bias with increased interactions and hierarchical structures.
	3. Showed the presence of human-like group effects in AI agent interactions.

**Result:** LLM-based AI agents developed stereotype-driven biases during interactions, which intensified with increased interaction rounds and hierarchical structures, demonstrating group effects similar to human social behavior.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on simulated environments and may not fully capture real-world complexities.

**Conclusion:** Stereotype formation in AI systems may emerge from multi-agent interactions rather than just training data biases, highlighting the need for further research on mitigating ethical impacts.

**Abstract:** While stereotypes are well-documented in human social interactions, AI systems are often presumed to be less susceptible to such biases. Previous studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power, particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent interactions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work underscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing preference optimization methods that rely on single responses and overlook other potential outputs.

**Method:** The paper develops the HEAL framework, which formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking process within hypothesis spaces and uses two metrics: ranking accuracy and preference strength correlation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the HEAL framework for analyzing preference alignment in hypothesis spaces.
	2. Develops the UniHypoBench benchmark for evaluating hypothesis-based preference methods.
	3. Demonstrates the effectiveness of current preference learning methods in capturing and refining responses.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that current preference learning methods capture preferences from proxy models effectively while suppressing negative samples.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HEAL provides a new understanding of preference alignment and offers diagnostic tools for researchers to improve preference optimization methods.

**Abstract:** Preference optimization methods like DPO have achieved remarkable performance in LLM alignment. However, the evaluation for these methods relies on a single response and overlooks other potential outputs, which could also be generated in real-world applications within this hypothetical space. To address this issue, this paper presents a \textbf{H}ypothesis-based Pr\textbf{E}ference-aware \textbf{A}na\textbf{L}ysis Framework (HEAL), a novel evaluation paradigm that formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking process within hypothesis spaces. The framework incorporates two complementary metrics: ranking accuracy for evaluating ordinal consistency and preference strength correlation for assessing continuous alignment. To facilitate this framework, we develop UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark constructed from diverse instruction-response pairs. Through extensive experiments based on HEAL, with a particular focus on the intrinsic mechanisms of preference learning, we demonstrate that current preference learning methods can effectively capture preferences provided by proxy models while simultaneously suppressing negative samples. These findings contribute to preference learning research through two significant avenues. Theoretically, we introduce hypothesis space analysis as an innovative paradigm for understanding preference alignment. Practically, HEAL offers researchers robust diagnostic tools for refining preference optimization methods, while our empirical results identify promising directions for developing more advanced alignment algorithms capable of comprehensive preference capture.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the significant challenge of under-resourcing in Arabic language processing, specifically for subjectivity analysis.

**Method:** The authors developed a new dataset, AraDhati+, by combining existing Arabic datasets and fine-tuning several state-of-the-art Arabic language models including XLM-RoBERTa, AraBERT, and ArabianGPT.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the AraDhati+ dataset for Arabic subjectivity analysis

**Result:** The methodology yielded an impressive accuracy of 97.79% in Arabic subjectivity classification.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach successfully demonstrates its effectiveness in tackling the limitations of existing resources in Arabic language processing.

**Abstract:** Despite its significance, Arabic, a linguistically rich and morphologically complex language, faces the challenge of being under-resourced. The scarcity of large annotated datasets hampers the development of accurate tools for subjectivity analysis in Arabic. Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have proven highly effective for text classification in English and French. This paper proposes a new approach for subjectivity assessment in Arabic textual data. To address the dearth of specialized annotated datasets, we developed a comprehensive dataset, AraDhati+, by leveraging existing Arabic datasets and collections (ASTD, LABR, HARD, and SANAD). Subsequently, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art Arabic language models (XLM-RoBERTa, AraBERT, and ArabianGPT) on AraDhati+ for effective subjectivity classification. Furthermore, we experimented with an ensemble decision approach to harness the strengths of individual models. Our approach achieves a remarkable accuracy of 97.79\,\% for Arabic subjectivity classification. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges posed by limited resources in Arabic language processing.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Diffusion Language Models, Fast Decoding, Early Convergence, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Prophet, a fast decoding paradigm for diffusion language models (DLMs) that leverages early answer convergence to reduce inference time while maintaining high output quality.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** DLMs offer benefits over autoregressive models but have slower inference due to bidirectional attention and high refinement steps. The paper seeks to optimize DLM inference speed.

**Method:** Prophet uses early answer convergence to determine when to stop refining outputs, deciding between continuing the process or decoding all remaining tokens at once, based on confidence levels of top predictions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Prophet quick decoding method
	2. Demonstration of early answer convergence for DLMs
	3. Empirical validation of speed and quality enhancements on benchmark datasets

**Result:** Empirical evaluations show that Prophet can reduce decoding steps by up to 3.4x while maintaining high generation quality across multiple tasks with DLMs like LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of Prophet into existing DLMs significantly accelerates inference times while preserving output integrity, offering a new perspective on DLM decoding processes.

**Abstract:** Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Commonsense reasoning, Math reasoning, Benchmarking, Interpretability

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa) to evaluate LLMs on tasks requiring both commonsense and math reasoning, revealing a significant performance gap when these skills are combined.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks primarily focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, but real-world tasks often require a combination of both skills.

**Method:** We tested 61 LLMs of varying sizes and training strategies on AgentCoMa, which consists of tasks requiring both commonsense and math reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the AgentCoMa benchmark for mixed-type reasoning
	2. Empirical evaluation across 61 LLMs with performance analysis
	3. Interpretability studies revealing performance gaps with neuron patterns and attention maps.

**Result:** LLMs perform well on individual reasoning types but show a ~30% drop in accuracy when tasks require combined reasoning; humans maintain high accuracy for both types.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on LLMs and does not explore other AI or model types; further research needed to enhance model robustness in mixed-type reasoning.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight model brittleness in mixed-type reasoning and provide a framework for further advancements in LLM capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy on complex commonsense and mathematical problems that involve the composition of multiple reasoning steps. However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills tend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents solving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning step. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training strategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet their accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a substantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior compositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning type. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional questions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better understand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and membership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model brittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a test bed for future improvement.

**TL;DR:** MathBuddy is an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor that adapts to students' emotions to improve learning effectiveness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The adoption of LLM-based conversational systems in education lacks consideration for students' emotional states, which can significantly impact learning outcomes.

**Method:** MathBuddy captures students' emotions from conversational text and facial expressions, utilizing both to provide empathetic responses and enhance the tutoring experience.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an emotionally aware tutor that uses LLM technology.
	2. Integration of emotional state modeling from text and facial expressions.
	3. Empirical validation showing significant performance improvements in tutoring outcomes.

**Result:** The model was evaluated across eight pedagogical dimensions, demonstrating a 23 point performance gain in win rates and a 3 point gain in overall DAMR scores.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Modeling students' emotional states can significantly improve the pedagogical effectiveness of LLM-based tutoring systems.

**Abstract:** The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already transforming the landscape of educational technology. However, the current state-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's affective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim that positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's emotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions and user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win rate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly supports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by modeling students' emotions.

**TL;DR:** Proposes ReSURE, an adaptive learning method to mitigate supervision errors in multi-turn dialogue systems by dynamically down-weighting unreliable supervision.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** High-quality supervision is crucial for fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems, but low-quality data can degrade performance and propagate errors across turns.

**Method:** ReSURE uses Welford's online statistics to estimate per-turn loss distributions and dynamically reweight sample losses during training, avoiding explicit data filtering.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces an adaptive learning approach that down-weights supervision errors during training.
	2. Establishes a method for dynamic loss reweighting based on per-turn statistics.
	3. Demonstrates improved response quality and stability across various datasets.

**Result:** Experiments show that ReSURE enhances stability and response quality on single-source and mixed-quality datasets, achieving significant positive correlations between response scores and sample counts regardless of data quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ReSURE enables more effective use of large-scale data in training multi-turn dialogue systems without requiring prior filtering of data quality.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems requires high-quality supervision but often suffers from degraded performance when exposed to low-quality data. Supervision errors in early turns can propagate across subsequent turns, undermining coherence and response quality. Existing methods typically address data quality via static prefiltering, which decouples quality control from training and fails to mitigate turn-level error propagation. In this context, we propose ReSURE (Regularizing Supervision UnREliability), an adaptive learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision without explicit filtering. ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using Welford's online statistics and reweights sample losses on the fly accordingly. Experiments on both single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved stability and response quality. Notably, ReSURE enjoys positive Spearman correlations (0.21 ~ 1.0 across multiple benchmarks) between response scores and number of samples regardless of data quality, which potentially paves the way for utilizing large-scale data effectively.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The long-tail label distribution in benchmark legal datasets leads to poor model performance on rare classes in legal text classification.

**Method:** Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) enhances training samples of low-frequency labels by retrieving from the training set only, avoiding information leakage and noise introduction for well-represented classes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) for legal text classification.
	2. Demonstration of SRA's effectiveness on benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions.
	3. Provision of a code repository for practical implementation.

**Result:** SRA outperforms existing LexGLUE baselines, achieving higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores on LEDGAR and UNFAIR-ToS datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SRA is an effective method for improving the performance of legal text classification on long-tail distributions without needing model architecture changes.

**Abstract:** Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain. Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution, where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on rare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a solution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external corpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR (single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA attains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE baselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in long-tail legal text classification.

**Motivation:** To address the lack of effective evaluation metrics for generative research synthesis systems, which are crucial for synthesizing knowledge and expertise in research.

**Method:** DeepScholar-bench is an automated evaluation framework that assesses generative research synthesis across three dimensions: knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability. It uses queries drawn from recent ArXiv papers to evaluate systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a holistic evaluation framework for generative research synthesis
	2. Development of DeepScholar-bench as a live benchmark
	3. Presentation of competitive baseline performance with DeepScholar-base

**Result:** DeepScholar-base, a reference implementation using the LOTUS API, achieves competitive performance compared to other systems evaluated. Despite this, no system has exceeded 19% across all metrics, highlighting the challenges in research synthesis.

**Limitations:** The benchmark is still not saturated, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving high performance in generative research synthesis tasks.

**Conclusion:** DeepScholar-bench presents a significant step forward in evaluating generative research synthesis systems, emphasizing the need for improved capabilities in this area to advance AI applications in research.

**Abstract:** The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human expertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting capabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over the live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited summaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing question-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to capture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In this work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic, automated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research synthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv papers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related work sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior research. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across three key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline implemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench framework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems, search AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that DeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher performance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains far from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\%$ across all metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well as its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative research synthesis. We make our code available at https://github.com/guestrin-lab/deepscholar-bench.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the vulnerability of large language models to jailbreak attacks, which exploit a distributional mismatch between training and real-world malicious instructions.

**Method:** IMAGINE employs embedding space distribution analysis and an iterative optimization process to generate and synthesize data examples that enhance safety alignment corpora.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a framework for generating jailbreak-like instructions using distribution analysis.
	2. Demonstrates a decrease in attack success rates for popular LLMs without sacrificing utility.
	3. Proposes an iterative optimization process for dynamic text generation improvement.

**Result:** The proposed IMAGINE framework led to significant decreases in the attack success rates against various LLMs (Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, Llama3.2) while maintaining their utility.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By systematically augmenting safety alignment data distributions with synthesized examples, IMAGINE improves LLMs' robustness against unseen malicious instructions.

**Abstract:** Despite advances in improving large language model(LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal large language models, spatial reasoning, human performance, benchmark evaluation, cognitive processes

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using a new benchmark, 11Plus-Bench, revealing their emerging abilities but significant performance gaps compared to humans.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the interplay between spatial reasoning and perception in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as current evaluations have not adequately explored this aspect.

**Method:** Introduced a systematic evaluation framework, utilizing the 11Plus-Bench, a benchmark derived from standardized spatial aptitude tests, for assessing MLLMs' spatial reasoning relative to human performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the 11Plus-Bench benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs
	2. Detailed analysis of MLLMs' spatial cognition relative to human performance
	3. Identification of cognitive effort correlations in MLLMs' reasoning processes

**Result:** Experiments on 14 MLLMs showed that while they display early signs of spatial cognition, their performance lags behind humans, indicating significant gaps in reasoning predictability and cognitive effort correlation.

**Limitations:** Instance-level performance in MLLMs is largely random compared to the predictable correctness of human responses.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore both capabilities and limitations in MLLMs' spatial reasoning, offering insights for future model design.

**Abstract:** For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely entangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process, enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity. However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable insights for advancing model design.

**Read time:** 25 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs beyond perception and text comprehension, especially on structured, logic-driven tasks.

**Method:** Introduction of NPHardEval4V, a benchmark focusing on four NP-hard problems using structured visual layouts and textual prompts to test LVLMs' combinatorial reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NPHardEval4V benchmark for LVLMs
	2. Focus on NP-hard problems for assessing reasoning
	3. Findings on LVLMs' limitations in handling global optimization and abstraction tasks.

**Result:** LVLMs show decent performance on perception-based tasks but struggle significantly with reasoning tasks, revealing limitations in their architecture and design.

**Limitations:** The benchmark primarily highlights limitations in existing LVLM architectures without offering solutions for improvement.

**Conclusion:** NPHardEval4V serves as a scalable and interpretable tool for assessing and improving reasoning capabilities in multimodal systems.

**Abstract:** Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks tend to focus on perception or text-based comprehension, offering limited insight into how well these models perform on structured, logic-driven tasks that require both visual and linguistic reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NPHardEval4V, a multimodal benchmark suite grounded in four classical NP-hard problems: Knapsack, Set Cover, Traveling Salesperson, and Vertex Cover. Each task is presented through a combination of structured visual layouts and textual prompts, designed to assess the ability of LVLMs to perform combinatorial reasoning under visual-linguistic constraints. We evaluate a set of advanced open-source and closed-source vision-language models under a unified prompting and problem representation framework. This enables fair comparison across models and task types, while isolating key variables affecting performance. Our results show that while these models perform reasonably well on perception-based inputs, they struggle with global optimization, abstraction, and constraint satisfaction. No single model demonstrates consistent reasoning capability across all problem types, and common failure patterns reveal fundamental limitations in current architectures. By leveraging the structure and complexity of NP-hard problems, NPHardEval4V provides a scalable, interpretable, and challenging testbed for diagnosing reasoning behaviors in LVLMs. We hope this benchmark can support the community in building more robust, inference-capable multimodal systems. The benchmark dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lizhouf/NPHardEval4.

**Abstract:** Fairness in both Machine Learning (ML) predictions and human decision-making is essential, yet both are susceptible to different forms of bias, such as algorithmic and data-driven in ML, and cognitive or subjective in humans. In this study, we examine fairness using a real-world university admissions dataset comprising 870 applicant profiles, leveraging three ML models: XGB, Bi-LSTM, and KNN, alongside BERT embeddings for textual features. To evaluate individual fairness, we introduce a consistency metric that quantifies agreement in decisions among ML models and human experts with diverse backgrounds. Our analysis reveals that ML models surpass human evaluators in fairness consistency by margins ranging from 14.08\% to 18.79\%. Our findings highlight the potential of using ML to enhance fairness in admissions while maintaining high accuracy, advocating a hybrid approach combining human judgement and ML models.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper addresses the issue of safety degradation in fine-tuned large language models and proposes a weight merging technique to improve both safety and performance without needing additional safety data.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Fine-tuning large language models often leads to catastrophic forgetting, which negatively impacts model safety. The challenge is to maintain safety while improving performance on downstream tasks without access to high-quality safety datasets.

**Method:** The proposed method merges the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned models to simultaneously preserve safety and enhance performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a weight merging technique for LLMs
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining safety while enhancing downstream task performance
	3. Validation across multiple tasks and models.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that weight merging effectively mitigates safety degradation while improving performance across various downstream tasks and models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The method provides a practical solution to balance safety and performance in LLMs without the need for additional safety data.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, notably degrading the safety of originally aligned models. While some existing methods attempt to restore safety by incorporating additional safety data, the quality of such data typically falls short of that used in the original alignment process. Moreover, these high-quality safety datasets are generally inaccessible, making it difficult to fully recover the model's original safety. We ask: How can we preserve safety while improving downstream task performance without additional safety data? We show that simply merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned models effectively mitigates safety degradation while enhancing performance. Experiments across different downstream tasks and models validate the method's practicality and effectiveness.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional metrics in capturing summarization quality, especially factual accuracy in long narratives.

**Method:** The framework employs a Character Knowledge Graph (CKG) to evaluate summaries' factual consistency and provides refinement guidance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of NarrativeFactScore for evaluating summaries
	2. Leveraging Character Knowledge Graphs for factual consistency
	3. Demonstrating superior performance on summarization benchmarks

**Result:** Demonstrated superior performance on benchmarks compared to existing methods, improving the reliability of LLM-generated summaries.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Agent-driven evaluation systems like NarrativeFactScore can significantly enhance the factual reliability of summaries generated by LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated near-human performance in summarization tasks based on traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore. However, these metrics do not adequately capture critical aspects of summarization quality, such as factual accuracy, particularly for long narratives (>100K tokens). Recent advances, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, address the limitations of metrics based on lexical similarity but still exhibit factual inconsistencies, especially in understanding character relationships and states. In this work, we introduce NarrativeFactScore, a novel "Agent-as-a-Judge" framework for evaluating and refining summaries. By leveraging a Character Knowledge Graph (CKG) extracted from input and generated summaries, NarrativeFactScore assesses the factual consistency and provides actionable guidance for refinement, such as identifying missing or erroneous facts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NarrativeFactScore through a detailed workflow illustration and extensive validation on widely adopted benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to competitive methods. Our results highlight the potential of agent-driven evaluation systems to improve the factual reliability of LLM-generated summaries.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of existing metrics that fail to evaluate the structure and readability of LLM outputs, focusing on Markdown Awareness as a critical measure.

**Method:** MDEval combines model-based generation tasks with statistical methods to assess Markdown Awareness, using a dataset of 20K instances in English and Chinese.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MDEval as a benchmark for Markdown Awareness in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of significant performance improvements in open-source models through fine-tuning
	3. Open-sourcing the MDEval dataset for transparency and reproducibility.

**Result:** MDEval achieved a Spearman correlation of 0.791 and an accuracy of 84.1% when compared with human evaluations, significantly outperforming prior methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MDEval enables better evaluation of LLM performance related to content structure, improving the interpretability of model assessments and allowing less performant models to compete with top-tier models like GPT-4o.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are expected to offer structured Markdown responses for the sake of readability in web chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT). Although there are a myriad of metrics to evaluate LLMs, they fail to evaluate the readability from the view of output content structure. To this end, we focus on an overlooked yet important metric -- Markdown Awareness, which directly impacts the readability and structure of the content generated by these language models. In this paper, we introduce MDEval, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Markdown Awareness for LLMs, by constructing a dataset with 20K instances covering 10 subjects in English and Chinese. Unlike traditional model-based evaluations, MDEval provides excellent interpretability by combining model-based generation tasks and statistical methods. Our results demonstrate that MDEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.791 and an accuracy of 84.1% with human, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. Extensive experimental results also show that through fine-tuning over our proposed dataset, less performant open-source models are able to achieve comparable performance to GPT-4o in terms of Markdown Awareness.

**Keywords:** large language models, data generation, self-aligned perplexity, fine-tuning, reasoning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a scalable method for selecting the best data generation strategy for fine-tuning LLMs by introducing a new metric called self-aligned perplexity, which assesses how well candidate outputs align with the LLM's reasoning patterns.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of fine-tuned LLMs by selecting the optimal data generation technique from numerous possible methods without exhaustive training.

**Method:** The paper introduces a scalable approximate method that evaluates a small subset of generated data to identify effective generation strategies based on their familiarity to the target LLM, using a novel metric called self-aligned perplexity.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of self-aligned perplexity as a new metric for output selection
	2. Development of an approximate method for scalable data generation strategy evaluation
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements on reasoning tasks using the proposed method

**Result:** The method allows for significant performance enhancements on reasoning-focused benchmarks by training on outputs generated by the most suitable method identified through the proposed evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed self-aligned perplexity metric provides a more effective measure of output familiarity compared to traditional perplexity, leading to better fine-tuning outcomes for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large sets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid outputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge from teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model or prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training outputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the fine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data generation method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively training and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable approximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate its suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective outputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures familiarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in characterizing familiarity through empirical analyses and practical observations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel metric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own style and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective generation strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete training set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen method yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused benchmarks, particularly in cases where different candidate methods lead to highly divergent training outcomes. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/XuanRen4470/SPPL.

**Keywords:** children's drawings, Large Language Model, semantic similarity, word2vec, scientific concepts

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study investigates children's scientific drawings using LLM and word2vec to establish representation norms and examine factors influencing drawing consistency.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The aim is to address low ecological validity and subjective interpretation issues in previous research on children's drawings.

**Method:** The study analyzes 1420 children's scientific drawings across nine themes using LLM for identification and word2vec for semantic similarity calculations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Use of LLM in analyzing children's drawings
	2. Establishment of drawing representation norms
	3. Identification of factors affecting drawing consistency

**Result:** Most drawings show high consistency in representation, with a semantic similarity greater than 0.8; consistency is independent of recognition accuracy, indicating consistency bias.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the reliance on LLM's accuracy and the focus on specific scientific themes.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that LLM can aid in establishing norms for children's drawings, highlighting the importance of accuracy and teaching alignment in influencing drawing outcomes.

**Abstract:** The use of children's drawings to examining their conceptual understanding has been proven to be an effective method, but there are two major problems with previous research: 1. The content of the drawings heavily relies on the task, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The interpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the researchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific themes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for follow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation of most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity>0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the representation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition), indicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of influencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to investigate the effects of "sample size", "abstract degree", and "focus points" on drawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children represented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class. It was found that accuracy (of LLM's recognition) is the most sensitive indicator, and data such as sample size and semantic similarity are related to it; The consistency between classroom experiments and teaching purpose is also an important factor, many students focus more on the experiments themselves rather than what they explain.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Fine-grained annotation of wordplay types in a comprehensive dataset.
	2. Includes news context alongside each headline, enhancing relevance for humor research.
	3. Shows the potential for improved LLM performance in humor-related tasks.

**Result:** The dataset reveals that most wordplay involves collocations, idioms, and named entities. Experiments indicate significant room for improvement in LLMs' wordplay detection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** KoWit-24 serves as a valuable resource for advancing humor research and LLM capabilities in understanding wordplay.

**Abstract:** We present KoWit-24, a dataset with fine-grained annotation of wordplay in 2,700 Russian news headlines. KoWit-24 annotations include the presence of wordplay, its type, wordplay anchors, and words/phrases the wordplay refers to. Unlike the majority of existing humor collections of canned jokes, KoWit-24 provides wordplay contexts -- each headline is accompanied by the news lead and summary. The most common type of wordplay in the dataset is the transformation of collocations, idioms, and named entities -- the mechanism that has been underrepresented in previous humor datasets. Our experiments with five LLMs show that there is ample room for improvement in wordplay detection and interpretation tasks.

**TL;DR:** Introduces SuperBPE, a superword tokenizer that improves language model efficiency and performance by encoding tokens beyond traditional subwords.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing tokenization schemes that rely solely on subwords, which may not effectively capture the meaning in diverse languages and multi-word expressions.

**Method:** SuperBPE employs a pretokenization curriculum to first learn subwords and then superwords that bridge whitespace, resulting in more efficient tokenization compared to conventional BPE.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of superword tokenization for LMs
	2. Significant improvements in encoding efficiency and downstream task performance
	3. Reduction in computational resource requirements during inference

**Result:** SuperBPE encodes text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE while achieving a +4.0% absolute performance improvement across 30 downstream tasks and requiring 27% less inference compute.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SuperBPE enhances encoding efficiency and downstream performance, facilitating better language model training without complex changes to existing frameworks.

**Abstract:** The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall.

**Motivation:** To explore how moral framing in news articles impacts the presentation of information and to ensure AI summarizers recognize and retain this framing.

**Method:** The study employs automated summarization methods along with crowd-sourced and expert evaluations to assess the effectiveness of preserving moral framing in summaries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First study on moral framing preservation in AI news summarization
	2. Introduces a method for retaining morally charged language in summaries
	3. Demonstrates effectiveness through extensive evaluations.

**Result:** The proposed approach improves the retention of moral-laden language in AI-generated summaries, leading to better preservation of the original intent of journalists.

**Limitations:** The study is specific to news articles and may not generalize to other text forms.

**Conclusion:** Enhancing the preservation of moral framing in news summaries contributes to the informational and ethical responsibilities of automated news summarization.

**Abstract:** News articles are more than collections of facts; they reflect journalists' framing, shaping how events are presented to the audience. One key aspect of framing is the choice to write in (or quote verbatim) morally charged language as opposed to using neutral terms. This moral framing carries implicit judgments that automated news summarizers should recognize and preserve to maintain the original intent of the writer. In this work, we perform the first study on the preservation of moral framing in AI-generated news summaries. We propose an approach that leverages the intuition that journalists intentionally use or report specific moral-laden words, which should be retained in summaries. Through automated, crowd-sourced, and expert evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the preservation of moral framing while maintaining overall summary quality.

The effectiveness of these systems, both in terms of the calibre and cognitive difficulty of the resulting questions, depends heavily on the quality and modelling approach of the underlying ontologies, making it crucial to assess their fitness for this task. To date, there has been no comprehensive investigation into the specific ontology aspects or characteristics that affect the question generation process. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metrics for evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks in pedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology (a structured framework used for identifying task-specific metrics), a set of evaluation metrics have been derived from an expert assessment of questions generated by a question generation model. To validate the proposed metrics, we apply them to a set of ontologies previously used in question generation to illustrate how the metric scores align with and complement findings reported in earlier studies. The analysis confirms that ontology characteristics significantly impact the effectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibiting varying performance levels. This highlights the importance of assessing ontology quality with respect to Automatic Question Generation (AQG) tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MCCRS for leveraging multi-type contextual information
	2. Utilization of a mixture-of-experts framework for better recommendations
	3. Coordination of multiple experts via a ChairBot to enhance model performance.

**Result:** Experimental results show that MCCRS achieves significantly higher performance compared to existing baseline models for conversational recommender systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research concludes that integrating diverse contextual information through specialized experts improves the effectiveness of conversational recommendations.

**Abstract:** Conversational recommender systems enable natural language conversations and thus lead to a more engaging and effective recommendation scenario. As the conversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual information, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate external sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine different types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called MCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via mixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS incorporates both structured information and unstructured information, including the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history, and unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert specialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information). Multiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final results. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual information and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot breaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly higher performance compared to existing baselines.

**Conclusion:** The released data and models facilitate further research in scientific reasoning, revealing scaling benefits for larger models.

**Abstract:** Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.
