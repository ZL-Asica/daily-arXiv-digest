**Result:** The evaluation showed positive technology acceptance among students, with quantitative measures supporting the tool's utility and qualitative feedback highlighting both benefits and limitations of generative AI in peer review writing.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a small number of participants and focuses on the German language, which may not generalize to other contexts or languages.

**Conclusion:** Reviewriter demonstrates the potential of LLMs in educational applications, but further research is needed to optimize generative AI systems and understand their impact in real-world settings.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel opportunities for educational applications that have the potential to transform traditional learning for students. Despite AI-enhanced applications having the potential to provide personalized learning experiences, more studies are needed on the design of generative AI systems and evidence for using them in real educational settings. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate \texttt{Reviewriter}, a novel tool to provide students with AI-generated instructions for writing peer reviews in German. Our study identifies three key aspects: a) we provide insights into student needs when writing peer reviews with generative models which we then use to develop a novel system to provide adaptive instructions b) we fine-tune three German language models on a selected corpus of 11,925 student-written peer review texts in German and choose German-GPT2 based on quantitative measures and human evaluation, and c) we evaluate our tool with fourteen students, revealing positive technology acceptance based on quantitative measures. Additionally, the qualitative feedback presents the benefits and limitations of generative AI in peer review writing.

**Keywords:** mixed-dimensional information space, human-computer interaction, 3D interaction, augmented reality, virtual reality

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This dissertation introduces the concept of mixed-dimensional information space and presents three interactive systems that improve user interaction with both 2D and 3D entities.

**Read time:** 40 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the increasing complexity of information represented in various dimensions, there is a need for seamless interaction between 2D and 3D entities to enhance user experience.

**Method:** The dissertation introduces interactive techniques and systems to facilitate smooth interactions among mixed-dimensional entities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of mixed-dimensional information space concept.
	2. Development of MemoVis, PaperToPlace, and VRContour systems.
	3. Advancement of interaction techniques between 2D and 3D entities.

**Result:** The systems developed include MemoVis for generating 3D design feedback, PaperToPlace for transforming paper instructions into MR experiences, and VRContour for enhancing workflow in VR.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** These systems aim to streamline interactions in mixed-dimensional information spaces and address the challenges posed by integrating 2D and 3D objects.

**Abstract:** Mediated by today's visual displays, information space allows users to discover, access and interact with a wide range of digital and physical information. The information presented in this space may be digital, physical or a blend of both, and appear across different dimensions - such as texts, images, 3D content and physical objects embedded within real-world environment. Navigating within the information space often involves interacting with mixed-dimensional entities, visually represented in both 2D and 3D. At times, interactions also involve transitioning among entities represented in different dimensions. We introduce the concept of mixed-dimensional information space, encompassing entities represented in both 2D and 3D. Interactions within the mixed-dimensional information space should be seamless and efficient: users should be able to focus on their primary tasks without being distracted by interactions with or transitions between entities. While incorporating 3D representations into the mixed-dimensional information space offers intuitive and immersive ways to interact with complex information, it is important to address potential seams and inefficiencies that arise while interacting with both 2D and 3D entities. This dissertation introduces new interactive techniques and systems to realize seamless and efficient interactions within the mixed-dimensional information space. This dissertation introduces three interactive systems: MemoVis which aims to use emergent generative AI to help users create reference images for 3D design feedback; PaperToPlace which demonstrates how paper-based instruction documents can be transformed and spatialized into a context-aware MR experience; and VRContour which explores how contour delineation workflow can be brought into VR.

### [4] [Neuronal avalanches as a predictive biomarker of BCI performance: towards a tool to guide tailored training program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04745)

*Camilla Mannino, Pierpaolo Sorrentino, Mario Chavez, Marie-Costance Corsi*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Brain-Computer Interface, motor imagery, neuronal avalanches, biomarkers, individual learning variability

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This study proposes a novel approach using neuronal avalanches as biomarkers to improve Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) training protocols by accommodating individual learning variability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of fixed-length training paradigms in BCIs that overlook individual learning differences, contributing to BCI inefficiency in some users.

**Method:** EEG data was collected from healthy participants across four MI-BCI training sessions. Two features, avalanche length and activations, were extracted and analyzed to predict BCI performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces neuronal avalanches as biomarkers for BCI training.
	2. Demonstrates prediction of BCI performance through longitudinal analysis.
	3. Establishes the necessity for personalized BCIs based on individual learning variability.

**Result:** The study found significant effects of training and task conditions on the extracted features, with changes correlating with BCI performance. Predictive accuracy for BCI success reached up to 91% using Support Vector Regression and Classification models.

**Limitations:** The study is conducted only on healthy participants; results may not generalize to individuals with motor impairments.

**Conclusion:** Neuronal avalanche dynamics can serve as effective biomarkers for developing personalized BCI training protocols, helping to reduce the incidence of BCI illiteracy.

**Abstract:** Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) hold promise for restoring control in individuals with motor impairments. However, up to 30% of users remain unable to effectively use BCIs-a phenomenon termed ''BCI inefficiency.'' This study addresses a major limitation in current BCI training protocols: the use of fixed-length training paradigms that ignore individual learning variability. We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal avalanches-spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity-as biomarkers to characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche length and activations. These features revealed significant training and taskcondition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in these features across sessions ($\Delta$avalanche length and $\Delta$activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest. These findings demonstrate the utility of neuronal avalanche dynamics as robust biomarkers for BCI training, supporting the development of personalized protocols aimed at mitigating BCI illiteracy.

**Result:** User study with 10 participants showed significant improvements in overall usability and reduced task workload for blind users using QuickQue compared to traditional methods.

**Limitations:** The study was conducted with only 10 participants; further research is needed with larger sample sizes.

**Conclusion:** QuickQue enhances the accessibility of online reviews for blind users, making the information more manageable and less fatiguing to navigate.

**Abstract:** Online reviews have become an integral aspect of consumer decision-making on e-commerce websites, especially in the restaurant industry. Unlike sighted users who can visually skim through the reviews, perusing reviews remains challenging for blind users, who rely on screen reader assistive technology that supports predominantly one-dimensional narration of content via keyboard shortcuts. In an interview study, we uncovered numerous pain points of blind screen reader users with online restaurant reviews, notably, the listening fatigue and frustration after going through only the first few reviews. To address these issues, we developed QuickQue assistive tool that performs aspect-focused sentiment-driven summarization to reorganize the information in the reviews into an alternative, thematically-organized presentation that is conveniently perusable with a screen reader. At its core, QuickQue utilizes a large language model to perform aspect-based joint classification for grouping reviews, followed by focused summarizations within the groups to generate concise representations of reviewers' opinions, which are then presented to the screen reader users via an accessible interface. Evaluation of QuickQue in a user study with 10 participants showed significant improvements in overall usability and task workload compared to the status quo screen reader.

**Conclusion:** AI tools can significantly improve the adaptability and effectiveness of team dynamics, leading to better performance outcomes in diverse environments.

**Abstract:** Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members, enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven collaboration and long-term coordination.

**Abstract:** As modern large language models (LLMs) become integral to everyday tasks, concerns about their inherent biases and their potential impact on human decision-making have emerged. While bias in models are well-documented, less is known about how these biases influence human decisions. This paper presents two interactive experiments investigating the effects of partisan bias in LLMs on political opinions and decision-making. Participants interacted freely with either a biased liberal, biased conservative, or unbiased control model while completing these tasks. We found that participants exposed to partisan biased models were significantly more likely to adopt opinions and make decisions which matched the LLM's bias. Even more surprising, this influence was seen when the model bias and personal political partisanship of the participant were opposite. However, we also discovered that prior knowledge of AI was weakly correlated with a reduction of the impact of the bias, highlighting the possible importance of AI education for robust mitigation of bias effects. Our findings not only highlight the critical effects of interacting with biased LLMs and its ability to impact public discourse and political conduct, but also highlights potential techniques for mitigating these risks in the future.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an AI design framework focused on explainability in healthcare, validated through a prototype predicting postpartum depression risk.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this study is to create AI tools in healthcare that are understandable, trustworthy, and usable, particularly for predicting postpartum depression.

**Method:** The framework was synthesized from literature and expert input, leading to the development of a prototype which was iteratively refined through evaluation with clinicians.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the AI Explainability Framework
	2. Development of the System Explainability Scale (SES)
	3. Validation through a prototype focused on postpartum depression risk prediction

**Result:** The prototype received high usability scores with an average explainability score of 4.56 and demonstrated a strong correlation between the SES scores and explainability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework and SES metric offer an effective method for developing explainable AI tools in healthcare, enhancing usability and clinician satisfaction.

**Abstract:** An AI design framework was developed based on three core principles, namely understandability, trust, and usability. The framework was conceptualized by synthesizing evidence from the literature and by consulting with experts. The initial version of the AI Explainability Framework was validated based on an in-depth expert engagement and review process. For evaluation purposes, an AI-anchored prototype, incorporating novel explainability features, was built and deployed online. The primary function of the prototype was to predict the postpartum depression risk using analytics models. The development of the prototype was carried out in an iterative fashion, based on a pilot-level formative evaluation, followed by refinements and summative evaluation. The System Explainability Scale (SES) metric was developed to measure the influence of the three dimensions of the AI Explainability Framework. For the summative stage, a comprehensive usability test was conducted involving 20 clinicians, and the SES metric was used to assess clinicians` satisfaction with the tool. On a 5-point rating system, the tool received high scores for the usability dimension, followed by trust and understandability. The average explainability score was 4.56. In terms of understandability, trust, and usability, the average score was 4.51, 4.53 and 4.71 respectively. Overall, the 13-item SES metric showed strong internal consistency with Cronbach`s alpha of 0.84 and a positive correlation coefficient (Spearman`s rho = 0.81, p<0.001) between the composite SES score and explainability. A major finding was that the framework, combined with the SES usability metric, provides a straightforward approach for developing AI-based healthcare tools that lower the challenges associated with explainability.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Generative Embedding, large language models, text embeddings, NLP, self-supervised learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Generative Embedding large language Model (GEM), a method allowing LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings while retaining their text generation capabilities.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To simplify systems that use LLMs for tasks requiring embeddings and to resolve discrepancies between embedding models and LLMs.

**Method:** GEM employs a self-supervised approach where special token(s) are inserted into the text body, allowing LLMs to generate summarization embeddings by manipulating the attention mask.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a self-supervised method for embedding generation within LLMs.
	2. Demonstration of significant improvements on text embedding benchmarks without compromising LLM performance.
	3. Integration feasibility into existing LLM training processes.

**Result:** The proposed method significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP benchmarks (MMLU).

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GEM equips LLMs with advanced text embedding capabilities while preserving their original NLP functionalities.

**Abstract:** Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings, which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original NLP performance

### [19] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** automatic speech recognition, unseen accents, training data, speaker diversity, low-resource training

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper examines the impact of training data variables on the robustness of automatic speech recognition systems to unseen accents, advocating for a focus on increasing speaker diversity.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve automatic speech recognition systems for global accessibility, it is essential to enhance robustness to various accents, particularly unseen ones.

**Method:** The study systematically investigates the effects of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity in the training data on ASR performance, particularly in low-resource training scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the significance of speaker count over audio duration for ASR robustness.
	2. Provided insights into effective ASR training data composition for low-resource scenarios.
	3. Revealed limited benefits of accent diversity when controlling for speaker count.

**Result:** Findings indicate that increasing the number of speakers yields better ASR robustness compared to simply increasing the audio duration for individual speakers. More speakers also improve performance gains from scaling the number of training hours.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Practitioners are encouraged to prioritize increasing the number of speakers in ASR training data to build systems that perform better with new languages, rather than focusing solely on accent diversity or audio duration.

**Abstract:** To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers (which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for new languages.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a method for decomposing sentence embeddings into interpretable components, improving transparency and controllability in NLP systems.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a lack of interpretable understanding of sentence embeddings, which are crucial for NLP and AI applications.

**Method:** The authors employ dictionary learning on token-level representations to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings and analyze pooling effects.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Mechanistic decomposition of sentence embeddings
	2. Analysis of pooling effects on feature compression
	3. Insights into linear encoding of semantic and syntactic features

**Result:** The study reveals that semantic and syntactic features are linearly encoded in sentence embeddings, providing insights into their internal structure.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By bridging token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, this work enhances the understanding and utilization of sentence embeddings in NLP.

**Abstract:** Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations, and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies, we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

**TL;DR:** Proposes HTC-CLIP, a method that combines two approaches for Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) by using contrastive learning to improve text representation and class probability distribution.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing approaches that either separately encode label hierarchy or guide the structure within the text encoder for Hierarchical Text Classification.

**Method:** HTC-CLIP learns two sets of class probability distributions during training, combining hierarchy-aware text representation with text-informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of HTC-CLIP that combines separate and guided approaches
	2. Use of contrastive learning for improved text representation
	3. Demonstrated performance improvement on benchmark datasets

**Result:** HTC-CLIP demonstrated improvements of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score on two public benchmark datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

**Limitations:** Text overlap with other authors' work.

**Conclusion:** Combining separate encoding and guiding approaches in one architecture can enhance Hierarchical Text Classification performance.

**Abstract:** Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP over the existing state-of-the-art models.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Maltese, Low-resource Languages, Fine-tuning, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the performance of 55 large language models (LLMs) on Maltese, revealing that many models perform poorly, especially in generative tasks, with smaller fine-tuned models often outperforming them. It identifies crucial factors influencing performance, emphasizes the benefits of fine-tuning, and calls for more inclusive language technologies.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The effectiveness of large language models for low-resource languages like Maltese is not well understood, and this research aims to evaluate their performance on a range of tasks to promote more inclusive language technologies.

**Method:** The study evaluates 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese using a new benchmark that includes 11 discriminative and generative tasks. The analysis looks into performance factors and compares fine-tuning against prompting strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Performance evaluation of LLMs on a low-resource language (Maltese)
	2. Identification of significant factors affecting LLM performance
	3. Recommendations for adopting traditional modeling approaches for low-resource languages.

**Result:** Many large language models perform poorly on Maltese, particularly in generative tasks, while smaller fine-tuned models show better results across all tasks. Prior exposure to Maltese during model pre-training and instruction-tuning is found to be the most significant factor affecting performance.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on Maltese and does not explore the applicability of findings to other low-resource languages or contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the necessity for more inclusive language technologies and suggest that traditional language modeling approaches should be considered by researchers working with low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training. However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling approaches.

**Motivation:** To address the bottleneck of cross-domain data availability in training intent classifiers for e-commerce customer care across various channels, geographies, and languages.

**Method:** Introduces a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder, combined with a multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize across multiple domains with few labeled samples.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a novel embedder-cum-classifier architecture for intent classification.
	2. Demonstrates effective generalization across domains with few annotations.
	3. Achieves significant accuracy improvement over existing state-of-the-art models.

**Result:** The proposed model architecture demonstrates a 20-23% increase in accuracy for few-shot intent detection on Canada and Mexico e-commerce customer care datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The embedder-cum-classifier model effectively generalizes across domains with limited annotations, significantly enhancing intent detection performance in customer care scenarios.

**Abstract:** Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels (like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English, Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language) with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore the ability of language models to generalize rare grammatical constructions, similar to human language learners, by examining their understanding of the LET-ALONE construction.

**Method:** The authors constructed a synthetic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate language models on the syntactic and semantic properties of the LET-ALONE construction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a synthetic benchmark for evaluating language models
	2. Demonstration of language model sensitivity to grammatical form
	3. Identification of a gap in understanding of meanings in rare constructions

**Result:** Findings show that while language models are sensitive to the form of the LET-ALONE construction, they struggle to generalize its meaning correctly.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a single rare construction, potentially affecting the generalization of findings to other constructions or languages.

**Conclusion:** The results highlight a significant difference in sample efficiency regarding language form versus meaning in current transformer architectures compared to human learners.

**Abstract:** Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However, it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However, human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning. These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in human language learners.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism may improve LLM-based entity structure discovery quality in various scenarios without relying on schemas or annotations.

**Abstract:** Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results. To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing. Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains, showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [28] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)

*Apurv Verma, NhatHai Phan, Shubhendu Trivedi*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** watermarking, large language models, alignment, safety, helpfulness

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes the impact of watermarking techniques on the alignment properties of large language models (LLMs) and proposes a method to mitigate degradation in alignment performance.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To examine how watermarking techniques affect the truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness of LLM outputs, which are critical alignment properties.

**Method:** The paper conducts experiments with two watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW) across four aligned LLMs to track their effects on alignment properties, and introduces Alignment Resampling (AR) to restore alignment at inference time.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic analysis of watermarking impacts on LLM alignment properties.
	2. Introduction of Alignment Resampling (AR) to mitigate degradation effects.
	3. Establishment of a theoretical framework for improvement based on sample size.

**Result:** Experimental findings highlight two patterns of degradation due to watermarking: guard attenuation and guard amplification, alongside demonstrating that AR can effectively restore or surpass baseline alignment scores by sampling watermarked generations.

**Limitations:** The modified Gumbel watermarking sacrifices some distortion-freeness, which may affect certain applications.

**Conclusion:** The study reveals the tension between watermark strengths and model alignment, offering a practical approach to applying watermarked LLMs while maintaining detectability and alignment performance.

**Abstract:** Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between alignment objectives.   To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

### [29] [Aligning Large Language Models with Implicit Preferences from User-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04463)

*Zhaoxuan Tan, Zheng Li, Tianyi Liu, Haodong Wang, Hyokun Yun, Ming Zeng, Pei Chen, Zhihan Zhang, Yifan Gao, Ruijie Wang, Priyanka Nigam, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** User-Generated Content, Preference Learning, Large Language Models

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces PUGC, a framework that generates preference data by leveraging implicit human preferences in user-generated content (UGC) to improve the alignment of large language models with human values.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for better methods to learn from preference feedback in order to enhance the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and improve the quality of their responses, especially when traditional methods are costly and hard to scale.

**Method:** The PUGC framework utilizes implicit human preferences present in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to create preference data. It transforms UGC into user queries, generates responses using a policy model, and then scores those responses based on the UGC as a reference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the PUGC framework for preference data generation from UGC
	2. Demonstration of significant performance improvements over traditional methods
	3. Publication of code and dataset for further research

**Result:** Models trained using PUGC demonstrated a 9.37% performance enhancement compared to traditional methods, achieving a state-of-the-art win rate of 35.93% in length-controlled evaluations with Mistral-7B-Instruct, highlighting improved reward quality and domain-specific alignment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** PUGC successfully generates valuable preference data from UGC, enabling more scalable and effective model alignment with implicit human preferences, while also demonstrating robustness to variations in UGC quality.

**Abstract:** Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable, domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC quality, and theory of mind capabilities.

**TL;DR:** SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the reliability of text-to-SQL systems by addressing the issue of semantically incorrect generated queries.

**Method:** SQLens integrates error signals from the underlying database and the LLM to detect semantic errors in SQL clauses and guide corrections.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SQLens framework for semantic error detection
	2. Integration of LLM and database signals for query improvement
	3. Demonstrated empirical results showing improved F1 score and accuracy

**Result:** SQLens outperforms the best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and increases execution accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SQLens represents a significant advancement in enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of text-to-SQL systems.

**Abstract:** Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction. Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

**Motivation:** This work aims to leverage the strengths of both Small and Large Language Models to improve evaluation in ambiguous dialogue scenarios where traditional models struggle.

**Method:** Introduces SLIDE, which integrates SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting, and proposes Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) where SLM insights guide LLM evaluations, followed by SLM-derived adjustments to refine scores.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SLIDE for integrating SLMs and LLMs
	2. Development of Dual-Refinement Evaluation method
	3. Demonstrated superior performance in dialogue evaluation tasks

**Result:** Experiments show that DRE outperforms existing methods and demonstrates stronger alignment with human judgment across various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Combining small and large models can yield more reliable evaluation tools for open-ended tasks such as dialogue evaluation.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods, showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue evaluation.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought, Translation, Prompting Strategies, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models for translation tasks, finding that simpler prompts may produce better outcomes than complex multi-step techniques.

**Read time:** 16 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the effectiveness of decomposition strategies in improving translation performance of LLMs, particularly in light of recent advancements in multi-step prompting methods.

**Method:** The authors conduct empirical studies comparing traditional LLM prompting techniques, including newly proposed multi-step prompts, to simpler strategies like repeating the translation task to measure performance outcomes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Challenging the notion that multi-step prompting improves LLM translation performance.
	2. Demonstrating that simpler prompts, such as 'translate again', can outperform human-like step-wise approaches.
	3. Encouraging future exploration into the criteria for effective reasoning in translation tasks.

**Result:** The study reveals no significant performance improvement when using step-by-step prompting compared to simpler prompts, indicating that complex decomposition may not be necessary for optimal translation outcomes.

**Limitations:** The findings are model-specific and do not rule out the potential benefits of reasoning in other contexts or with different models.

**Conclusion:** While the analysis invites further research into the effectiveness of reasoning strategies in translation, it concludes that simpler prompting methods can yield superior results for the tested models.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's effectiveness in the context of translation.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** discourse particles, LLM, semantics, natural language processing, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper explores how well large language models (LLMs) can discern the nuanced meanings of the English discourse particle 'just'.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding discourse particles is essential for improving the semantic accuracy of natural language processing, particularly for large language models (LLMs).

**Method:** The study involved a careful analysis of LLM performance on data labeled by expert linguists regarding the various semantic uses of 'just'.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of LLMs' abilities to interpret discourse particles.
	2. Detailed labeling of usage of the particle 'just' by expert linguists.
	3. Highlighting specific shortcomings in LLM nuanced understanding.

**Result:** LLMs show some ability to differentiate between broad categories of meaning, but they fail to capture more subtle nuances in the usage of the particle 'just'.

**Limitations:** The paper primarily focuses on only one particle ('just'), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other discourse particles.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate significant limitations in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles, suggesting a need for further advancements in their semantic interpretation capabilities.

**Abstract:** Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just", a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of discourse particles.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest re-evaluating LLM capabilities and emphasize the importance of benchmarking on challenging questions.

**Abstract:** We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such questions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Evaluating machine translation quality for under-resourced African languages is challenging due to limited available metrics and data, necessitating improved solutions.

**Method:** The authors developed SSA-MTE, a human-annotated dataset for MT evaluation with 63,000 annotations across 13 African languages, and created SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE metrics. They benchmark these against state-of-the-art LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SSA-MTE, a large-scale dataset for African language MT evaluation
	2. Development of SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, new evaluation metrics
	3. Benchmarking performance against leading LLMs for translation tasks

**Result:** SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE significantly outperform existing metrics like AfriCOMET and are competitive with top-performing LLMs for low-resource languages, showing particularly strong results for Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The resources from this study can enhance future research in machine translation for African languages, providing a necessary dataset and metrics.

**Abstract:** Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings. While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues, they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13 African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released under open licenses to support future research.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses vulnerabilities in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to malicious behaviors that exploit system integrity while maintaining basic operations.

**Method:** The authors analyze four distinct types of integrity attacks within MAS through strategic prompt manipulations, demonstrating their effect on agent evaluations and interactions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of four types of integrity attacks in MAS
	2. Demonstration of systematic biases introduced by prompt manipulation
	3. Highlighting the inadequacies of existing monitoring systems against these attacks

**Result:** The study shows that specific prompt manipulations can introduce systematic biases in MAS operations and can circumvent current LLM-based monitoring systems.

**Limitations:** The paper does not discuss potential countermeasures or practical implementations of the proposed solutions.

**Conclusion:** There is a pressing need for enhanced security protocols and validation mechanisms in MAS to prevent prompt manipulation and ensure reliability.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning. Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions; \textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others. We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents. Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

**Motivation:** To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for financial sentiment analysis and understand the impact of reasoning on performance.

**Method:** Comparison of three proprietary LLMs under different prompting strategies with two smaller, fine-tuned financial models, using the Financial PhraseBank dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comparison of reasoning-based and non-reasoning models for financial sentiment analysis
	2. Insights on the impact of reasoning on LLM performance
	3. Findings suggest intuitive reasoning may be more aligned with human judgment in finance.

**Result:** The best performance was achieved with GPT-4o without CoT prompting, suggesting that fast intuitive reasoning aligns better with human judgment in financial contexts.

**Limitations:** Limited to the Financial PhraseBank dataset and specific LLMs tested.

**Conclusion:** Reasoning in LLMs may not always lead to better decision-making in financial sentiment analysis, challenging previous assumptions about the necessity of reasoning for high-stakes applications.

**Abstract:** We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate) thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions. This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive "System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to "System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes financial applications.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' performance on lexically diversified logical reasoning problems, and proposes MenTaL, a method to improve LLM translation from diverse expressions to formal logic.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges LLMs face in translating lexical diversity in logical reasoning, which affects their reliability in real-world applications.

**Method:** The authors propose SCALe, a benchmark that introduces logic-invariant lexical diversification and utilizes LLMs to transform benchmark datasets into lexically diversified versions. They also introduce MenTaL, a method that helps LLMs unify diverse expressions before translation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SCALe benchmark for lexical diversification in logical reasoning.
	2. Development of MenTaL method to unify diverse expressions for LLM translation.
	3. Empirical evidence showing performance improvement in LLMs using the new benchmark and method.

**Result:** Experiments show that current LLMs struggle with logical reasoning tasks when lexical diversity is present, and applying MenTaL improves their performance on these tasks.

**Limitations:** The study relies on existing LLM architectures and focuses on lexical diversity, which may not encompass all aspects of translation reliability.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the need for better benchmarks to evaluate LLMs in logical reasoning and demonstrates that addressing lexical diversity can significantly enhance their translation capabilities.

**Abstract:** Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the critical challenge of demonstration selection in many-shot ICL without needing fine-tuning, enhancing the adaptability of LLMs.

**Method:** The proposed approach aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and selected examples to improve demonstration selection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel gradient matching approach for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL.
	2. Demonstrated superior performance compared to random selection across 9 diverse datasets.
	3. Paved the way for more effective large-scale applications of ICL in LLMs.

**Result:** The gradient matching method consistently outperformed random selection across various datasets and model sizes, achieving up to 4% improvement on larger LLMs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This method unlocks more reliable many-shot ICL, allowing for broader applications in LLMs.

**Abstract:** In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios, we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g., Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

**Motivation:** The increasing prevalence of misinformation necessitates effective automated fact-checking systems, which struggle against adversarial claims meant to deceive them.

**Method:** SUCEA decomposes fact-checking into three phases: segmenting claims into sub-claims, iteratively retrieving evidence and editing claims, and aggregating evidence to predict entailment labels.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a training-free modular framework for fact-checking
	2. Improved accuracy in processing adversarial claims
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness on challenging datasets

**Result:** Experiments on fact-checking datasets reveal that SUCEA significantly improves retrieval and entailment prediction accuracy compared to existing baselines that decompose claims.

**Limitations:** The method's performance may vary based on the complexity of claims and the quality of retrieved evidence.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework offers a more efficient approach to fact-checking by simplifying the claims, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of evidence retrieval.

**Abstract:** Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label. Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal reasoning, claim verification, scientific literature, vision-language models, benchmark

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a new benchmark, MuSciClaims, for assessing multimodal claim verification in scientific literature, highlighting significant shortcomings of current vision-language models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of multimodal benchmarks that assess claim verification abilities in scientific claims utilizing figures and charts.

**Method:** The authors automatically extract claims from scientific articles, manipulate these claims to create contradicted versions, and design diagnostic tasks to evaluate model performance on claim verification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MuSciClaims benchmark.
	2. Development of diagnostic tasks to evaluate model failures in claim verification.
	3. Identification of specific areas where vision-language models fall short in multimodal reasoning.

**Result:** Results indicate that vision-language models perform poorly (F1 scores ~0.3-0.5), with the best model achieving F1 of only 0.77, indicating bias and misunderstanding in claims.

**Limitations:** Models are generally biased towards supporting claims and perform poorly in figure interpretation.

**Conclusion:** The existing multimodal models struggle with evidence localization, information aggregation, and comprehension of scientific figures, underscoring the need for better approaches in multimodal reasoning.

**Abstract:** Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning, and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of the figure.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a framework called $Safe$ for verifying reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using formal mathematical proofs to reduce hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought prompting.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current methods for mitigating hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting of LLMs are opaque and lack verifiable evidence, limiting effectiveness in critical applications.

**Method:** The proposed framework $Safe$ employs formal mathematical language (Lean 4) for articulating mathematical claims at each reasoning step and provides formal proofs to verify these claims and detect hallucinations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a formal verification framework $Safe$ for LLMs.
	2. Development of $FormalStep$, a benchmark for theorem proving and step correctness.
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvement in LLM reasoning with interpretable proof.

**Result:** Evaluation of $Safe$ across multiple language models and mathematical datasets shows a significant performance improvement in reasoning accuracy and interpretable evidence of correctness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** $Safe$ represents a pioneering effort in using formal mathematics to verify outputs from LLMs, enhancing the trustworthiness of automated reasoning.

**Abstract:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$ formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the pressing moral questions surrounding bias and fairness in general-purpose AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs).

**Method:** An analysis of various technical fairness frameworks was conducted to identify challenges in evaluating fairness in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of technical fairness frameworks for LLMs
	2. Identification of inherent challenges in evaluating LLM fairness
	3. Proposals for future research directions in AI fairness

**Result:** The study reveals that existing fairness frameworks are either logically incompatible with the context of general-purpose AI or impractical due to the complexities of training data and human demographics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Despite the challenges in implementing fairness evaluations for LLMs, it remains critical and future research should focus on establishing standards for LLM developers and context-specific fairness evaluations.

**Abstract:** The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of "bias" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.

**Result:** The best performing baseline achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17%, indicating room for improvement in the model's performance.

**Limitations:** The highest Macro F1 score achieved is still below 80%, indicating potential for significant improvement.

**Conclusion:** The MISMATCHED benchmark provides a valuable resource for evaluating scientific NLI in non-CS domains and highlights the effectiveness of including implicit NLI relations in training.

**Abstract:** Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles. Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS) domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED. The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark, we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI relation between them in model training improves their performance on scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

**Motivation:** To improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models during inference while addressing the limitations of generating diverse outputs.

**Method:** A structured survey categorizing TTS methods into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies, followed by the introduction of the ADAPT method which utilizes diversity-focused data for prefix tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Survey of TTS methods

**Result:** ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks using eight times less compute compared to strong baselines, indicating improved TTS effectiveness.

**Limitations:** The reliance on generative diversity may limit the approach's applicability in scenarios where diverse output is not prioritized.

**Conclusion:** Generative diversity plays a critical role in maximizing the effectiveness of Test-Time Scaling methods for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in maximizing TTS effectiveness.

**Motivation:** To understand the relationship between social structures and innovation capacity, particularly through the lens of machine learning and personal perspectives of innovators.

**Method:** The study quantifies subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities using dynamic language representations, and analyzes data from millions of contributors in various creative domains.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Quantified subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities using machine learning.
	2. Demonstrated the predictive power of perspective diversity on creative outcomes.
	3. Analyzed creative collaborations using AI agents to mimic social dynamics.

**Result:** Subjective perspectives predict what ideas and collaborations lead to successful innovation, with greater perspective diversity resulting in enhanced creative achievement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Collaborators who effectively utilize a common language and diverse experiences are more likely to innovate successfully; findings have implications for team assembly and research policy.

**Abstract:** Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however, enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team assembly and research policy.

	3. Demonstration of improved performance on semantic tasks relative to existing models.

**Result:** Our model outperforms existing static models on various monolingual and cross-lingual tasks and competes with advanced models like SimCSE on some datasets.

**Limitations:** The model's performance may still be context-dependent and may not generalize to all sentence structures.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively refines word embeddings by focusing on semantics, leading to better sentence-level representations with minimal computational costs during inference.

**Abstract:** We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

**Motivation:** Current LLMs struggle with unreliable tool utilization due to low-quality datasets and weak reflection abilities, limiting their problem-solving capabilities.

**Method:** The authors introduce Tool-MVR, which combines Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) for dataset improvement and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) for enhanced reflection.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Tool-MVR for better tool utilization in LLMs
	2. Development of ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R datasets
	3. Significant improvements in performance metrics over existing LLMs

**Result:** Tool-MVR surpasses existing models like ToolLLM and GPT-4 in performance and reduces API calls, achieving significant error correction rates on benchmarks for tool reflection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Tool-MVR represents a significant advancement in LLM capabilities for tool use through innovative learning methods.

**Abstract:** Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems. However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g., widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities (over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE), which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%, with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios. Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9% error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

**Motivation:** The memory demands of KV cache in transformer models scale poorly with sequence length, making scalable deployment of large language models challenging.

**Method:** TaDA introduces a training-free approach to KV cache compression, focusing on adaptive quantization precision across layers and mean centering to handle outliers more efficiently.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Training-free KV cache compression technique
	2. Adaptive quantization precision across layers
	3. Significant reduction in memory footprint without sacrificing accuracy

**Result:** The proposed method reduces the KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy across multiple models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TaDA enables more scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models, facilitating longer context lengths and improved reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and longer chain of thoughts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks for LLMs focus on static, single-turn planning tasks, which do not reflect real-world needs for adaptability and constraint management.

**Method:** We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, utilizing the TravelPlanner dataset and establishing two evaluation settings: sequential constraint introduction and scenarios with prioritized competing constraints.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Flex-TravelPlanner benchmark
	2. Novel evaluation settings for sequential constraint introduction
	3. Insights on models' performance in dynamic planning scenarios

**Result:** Analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B shows a disconnect between single-turn performance and multi-turn adaptability, with significant effects from constraint introduction order and challenges with prioritization.

**Limitations:** The evaluation focuses only on specific LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama 3.1), which may not generalize to all models.

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the necessity for realistic evaluation of LLMs in dynamic contexts, with recommendations for enhancing model effectiveness in complex planning tasks.

**Abstract:** Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner}, we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the pressing concerns regarding the safe deployment of AI systems, particularly large language models, and their susceptibility to misuse.

**Method:** The paper draws on moral psychology to compare the deliberative reasoning capabilities of humans with the 'shallow alignment' of LLMs, illustrating how this affects resilience to adversarial attacks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critiques the effectiveness of existing LLM alignment strategies
	2. Introduces the concept of 'shallow alignment' in LLMs
	3. Suggests parallels between human moral reasoning and AI normative deliberation

**Result:** It is concluded that existing alignment strategies fail to prevent manipulation of LLMs, as they reinforce superficial behavioral norms rather than fostering deeper normative reasoning abilities.

**Limitations:** The paper may not provide specific solutions or methodologies for improving LLM alignment strategies, focusing instead on diagnosing the problem.

**Conclusion:** The findings imply that current alignment approaches are inadequate for ensuring AI safety and that significant improvements are necessary to address the vulnerabilities of capable AI systems.

**Abstract:** The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods: they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

*Thao Nguyen, Yang Li, Olga Golovneva, Luke Zettlemoyer, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Xian Li*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large language models, Data recycling, Pre-training, Synthetic data, Quality transformation

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents REWIRE, a method for transforming low-quality web documents to improve the effectiveness of pre-training large language models by mixing high-quality and rewritten texts, ultimately enhancing model performance across various tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The performance of large language models relies on the availability of quality training data, which is constrained by the inefficiencies in current data filtering practices that discard significant amounts of potentially useful text.

**Method:** REWIRE proposes to recycle and enrich low-quality documents that are typically filtered out during the data curation process, allowing for the effective integration of synthetic data into pre-training datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of REWIRE for enriching low-quality documents
	2. Demonstrated improvements in model performance through mixed data
	3. Showcased advantages over traditional synthetic data generation methods

**Result:** The experiments show that mixing high-quality and rewritten texts leads to improvements in model performance by 1.0 to 2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks, outperforming traditional methods of data augmentation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** REWIRE can effectively enhance the data pool for pre-training large language models, indicating that recycling discarded web data may provide a viable solution for scaling data resources.

**Abstract:** Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The prevalence of hate speech on the internet poses risks to societal harmony and individual well-being, particularly with the difficulty of detecting more subtle forms of hate speech.

**Method:** The authors present a taxonomy for implicit hate speech and two methods for integration: using LLMs for classification through prompting and embedding codetypes during the encoding process of LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. New taxonomy for implicit hate speech detection
	2. Integration methods for codetypes in LLMs
	3. Validation of effectiveness across multiple languages

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that the integration of codetypes significantly enhances the performance of implicit hate speech detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods validate the effectiveness of codetypes in improving the detection of implicit hate speech across different languages.

**Abstract:** The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets, validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

**Result:** STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding and outperforms existing speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput, while maintaining accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** As a model-free solution, STAND can be easily integrated into existing language models without needing additional training, providing a significant reduction in inference latency with superior performance in reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search. However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources, creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module, combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by 48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for accelerating language model reasoning.

**TL;DR:** SPARTA ALIGNMENT is a competitive algorithm for aligning multiple LLMs through peer evaluation and iterative learning, showing improved performance across various tasks.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of diversity and bias in individual LLMs by leveraging multiple models that compete for optimal instruction fulfillment while judging each other's performance.

**Method:** The algorithm involves selecting two models to compete in response to a given instruction, with other models evaluating their outputs. An adapted Elo-ranking system aggregates evaluation scores, enabling the model outputs to become preference pairs for further learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SPARTA ALIGNMENT algorithm for LLM alignment
	2. Utilization of competitive evaluation and Elo-ranking system
	3. Demonstrates superior performance and generalization of LLMs through collective learning

**Result:** SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and self-alignment baselines by an average of 7.0% across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach enhances the self-evolution of LLMs through an iterative competition process and demonstrates improved generalization to unseen tasks, benefiting from the diversity of model expertise.

**Abstract:** We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one, and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration. SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce more logical, direct and informative outputs.

**Motivation:** Address the challenges of fake news detection in social media, particularly the limitations of conventional deep learning methods and the inadequacies of LLMs in adapting to rapidly changing news environments.

**Method:** Introducing the Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework that uses a multi-round collaborative learning approach, along with a lifelong knowledge editing module and a replay-based continue learning method.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel C$^2$EFND framework that integrates LLMs and SLMs

**Result:** C$^2$EFND outperforms existing methods on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and adaptability in detecting fake news in dynamic situations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework effectively utilizes the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the classification prowess of SLMs, improving fake news detection significantly without requiring total retraining.

**Abstract:** The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges. The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods, effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a challenge in evaluating text revisions in scientific writing, as traditional metrics may not capture meaningful improvements effectively.

**Method:** A manual annotation study was conducted to assess different revisions, followed by an exploration of reference-free evaluation metrics and LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for text revision.
	2. Exploration of reference-free evaluation methods in NLP.
	3. Proposal of a hybrid assessment approach combining LLMs and domain-specific metrics.

**Result:** The study showed LLMs can assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. A hybrid approach combining LLM evaluation and task-specific metrics yields the best assessment of revision quality.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of LLMs in assessing correctness is limited, indicating that further improvement is needed.

**Conclusion:** A hybrid evaluation approach that integrates LLMs and domain-specific metrics offers more reliable assessments of text revision quality.

**Abstract:** Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains. Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current evaluations of LLMs' political responses often misalign with their internal intentions, necessitating a deeper understanding of their internal mechanisms.

**Method:** The authors designed a four-dimensional framework and constructed a dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning, applying interpretable representation engineering techniques across eight open-source LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a four-dimensional political learning framework for LLMs.
	2. Developed a dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning.
	3. Validated the vectors for semantic meaning and robustness in detection and intervention tasks.

**Result:** The developed vectors effectively disentangle political concept confounds, showing validation in semantic meaning and robustness in out-of-distribution settings.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the scope of the open-source LLMs analyzed and the chosen representation engineering techniques.

**Conclusion:** These vectors enable the intervention in LLMs to generate responses reflective of different political leanings, advancing the study of LLMs' political opinions.

**Abstract:** Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

**Motivation:** To bridge the gap in fine-grained perception and reasoning capabilities of SpeechLLMs in real-world spoken language understanding.

**Method:** MMSU consists of 5,000 curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks, incorporating various linguistic phenomena.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MMSU benchmark
	2. Incorporation of diverse linguistic phenomena
	3. Rigorous evaluation of existing SpeechLLMs

**Result:** Evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs reveals significant shortcomings, indicating potential improvement areas for future models.

**Limitations:** Focuses predominantly on spoken language and may not address all facets of language understanding.

**Conclusion:** MMSU sets a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding, offering insights for enhancing human-AI speech interactions.

**Abstract:** Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content), paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics, semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models, highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ddwang2000/MMSU. Evaluation Code is available at https://github.com/dingdongwang/MMSU_Bench.

**Abstract:** The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.

**Motivation:** To provide a comprehensive evaluation of logical reasoning in LLMs that goes beyond final-answer accuracy.

**Method:** FineLogic evaluates reasoning across overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment, with studies on supervision formats during fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of FineLogic for evaluating logical reasoning in LLMs
	2. Insights on the effectiveness of different supervision styles during fine-tuning
	3. Demonstrated importance of stepwise reasoning over simple correctness in LLMs

**Result:** Natural language supervision leads to better generalization, while symbolic reasoning enhances inference structures; fine-tuning improves reasoning through step-by-step generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework offers a more rigorous and interpretable method for assessing and enhancing reasoning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition, to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying mistranslations and omissions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore real-world applications of AI-driven educational assessment using VLM and LLM in underrepresented educational contexts.

**Method:** Evaluated a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses across two subjects, Mathematics and English, from six Indonesian schools.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of VLM and LLM performance in a real-world educational context
	2. Insights into challenges of handwriting recognition in grading
	3. Analysis of LLM feedback utility despite input imperfections

**Result:** The VLM struggled with recognizing handwriting accurately, leading to error propagation in LLM grading; however, LLM-generated feedback was somewhat useful despite limitations.

**Limitations:** Struggles with handwriting recognition and limitations in personalization and contextual relevance of feedback.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs can produce useful feedback, challenges in handwriting recognition and personalization need to be addressed for better application in educational settings.

**Abstract:** Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools, covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than 14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in personalization and contextual relevance persist.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an LLM-based system for solving cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers and providing wordplay explanations, achieving state-of-the-art results on a benchmark dataset.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks that require skilled reasoning, and there is a need for improved automated solutions to assist in solving them.

**Method:** The proposed system hypothesizes potential answers, generates corresponding wordplay explanations, and employs a verification mechanism that utilizes codified reasoning steps.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. LLM-based reasoning system for cryptic crossword clues
	2. Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset
	3. Provides interpretable wordplay reasoning for solutions expressed in Python

**Result:** The system demonstrates a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, indicating significant advancements in automated reasoning for cryptic clues.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This research establishes a foundation for enhanced interpretation of crossword clues through LLMs, with the systematic reasoning steps made accessible in Python.

**Abstract:** Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for inspection.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces RACE, a framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models by analyzing their explicit reasoning traces.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issue of redundancy and logical inconsistencies in reasoning traces of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which can lead to hallucinations.

**Method:** RACE extracts essential reasoning steps and computes four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the RACE framework for hallucination detection in LRMs.
	2. Analysis of reasoning traces with multiple diagnostic signals.
	3. Empirical validation showing superior performance compared to existing methods.

**Result:** RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection methods, providing a robust solution for evaluating LRMs with a focus on fine-grained hallucination detection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RACE offers significant improvements in hallucination detection for LRMs, making it a valuable tool for ensuring the reliability of complex AI systems.

**Abstract:** Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit, multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines, offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of dedicated datasets and tools for analyzing and evaluating simultaneous interpreting, which is a complex task involving rendering source speeches with minimal delay.

**Method:** Introduction of MockConf, a dataset with 7 hours of multilingual recordings, and the development of InterAlign, a web-based tool for aligning and annotating these recordings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the MockConf dataset with detailed annotations for interpreting tasks.
	2. Development of InterAlign tool for modern web-based parallel annotations.
	3. Proposition of new evaluation metrics and baseline for automatic alignment.

**Result:** MockConf dataset includes transcriptions aligned by spans and words and provides metrics for evaluation along with a baseline for automatic alignment.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MockConf and InterAlign offer new resources for the research community to facilitate the study of simultaneous interpreting.

**Abstract:** In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis, monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization) between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are released to the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the potential of LLMs in generating MCQs, making the assessment process more efficient for educators.

**Method:** A comparative analysis of Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 was conducted by injecting knowledge into prompts and evaluating the generated MCQs through metrics with feedback from 21 educators.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comparative analysis of Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 for MCQ generation.
	2. Emphasizing the method of injecting knowledge into prompts for better control.
	3. Insights into educator reluctance regarding AI adoption in education.

**Result:** GPT-3.5 was found to generate the most effective MCQs according to several metrics, reflecting its potential in educational applications.

**Limitations:** The study relies on the effectiveness of the LLMs for generating MCQs but does not address wider implications of AI in education.

**Conclusion:** LLMs can significantly improve the generation of MCQs, enhancing the educational experience, though educators still show reluctance towards AI integration.

**Abstract:** Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational materials and question answering, but there are still space for new applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM, but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations, giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience, providing valuable insights for the future.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the effectiveness of isometric machine translation using various large language models across multiple language pairs, revealing that prompt design impacts translation quality and length control significantly.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how isometric machine translation performs under specific conditions and identify strategies that optimize translation quality and length control for language pairs.

**Method:** The study utilizes eight open-source large language models and tests different prompting strategies with varying numbers of few-shot examples while implementing isometric demonstrations for translation tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the impact of prompt design on length control and translation quality.
	2. Identified that few-shot approaches lead to marginal improvements in translation.
	3. Showed that using multiple outputs improves the balance between quality and length in translation.

**Result:** The findings suggest that proper instruction phrasing and extreme examples are necessary to control output length. Few-shot prompting improves translation quality but has diminishing returns, and considering multiple outputs is beneficial for achieving better quality-length tradeoffs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Optimizing prompt strategies and instruction phrasing can significantly enhance isometric machine translation, contributing to state-of-the-art results for certain language pairs.

**Abstract:** In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10, and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in understanding the effectiveness of Universal Dependencies (UD) in linguistic representation and its impact on pretrained language models in cross-lingual tasks.

**Method:** The study integrates Universal Dependencies into pretrained language models and evaluates their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of UD into pretrained language models
	2. Demonstrated improvements in accuracy and F1 scores
	3. Correlation between UD similarity scores and model performance

**Result:** Incorporating UD resulted in significant gains in accuracy (3.85%) and F1 scores (6.08%), reducing the performance gap with large language models in several language pairs and sometimes outperforming them.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings confirm the validity of integrating UD for enhancing model performance in out-of-domain tasks and establishing a correlation between UD similarity scores and model performance.

**Abstract:** Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and 6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for improved benchmarks and metrics for evaluating LLMs' coding and reasoning abilities due to inadequacies in existing tools and methods.

**Method:** ICPC-Eval features 118 curated problems from recent ICPC contests, a test case generation method, a local evaluation toolkit, and the introduction of the Refine@K metric for better evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Realistic ICPC competition scenario with actual contest problems
	2. Robust test case generation and evaluation toolkit
	3. New metric Refine@K for iterative solution improvement

**Result:** Evaluation showed that top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 perform significantly better with multi-turn feedback, but still fall short compared to human teams.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may not cover all possible coding scenarios or problem types that would be encountered in diverse coding environments.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs show promise, they require iterative feedback to achieve their potential and currently do not outperform the best human teams in coding competitions.

**Abstract:** With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2) A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still lag behind top-performing human teams.

**TL;DR:** Introducing Verbose ListOps, a benchmark aimed at evaluating LLMs' performance in nested narrative reasoning and state management.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing benchmarks inadequately test LLMs' capabilities in nested reasoning and fail to address their limitations in handling context length and reasoning complexity.

**Method:** The study introduces Verbose ListOps, which transposes ListOps computations into lengthy narratives, testing LLMs on their state management abilities and narrative understanding.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Verbose ListOps as a benchmark for nested reasoning
	2. Identification of LLM vulnerabilities in state management
	3. Development of a framework enabling granular control over narrative size and reasoning difficulty.

**Result:** Experiments show that leading LLMs significantly decline in performance on Verbose ListOps at moderate narrative lengths, highlighting their struggles with nested reasoning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Addressing LLM failures in nested reasoning is crucial for real-world text interpretation, and Verbose ListOps provides a framework for achieving targeted reasoning enhancements.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text, struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty. Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge work.

**Motivation:** There is a widespread belief that fine-tuning existing multilingual ASR models leads to state-of-the-art results for low-resource languages, but this paper argues against that notion.

**Method:** The authors propose a hybrid model combining HMMs with self-supervised learning techniques and semi-supervised training to utilize available speech and text data more effectively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a hybrid HMM and self-supervised learning approach for ASR
	2. Demonstrated substantial performance improvements on Scottish Gaelic
	3. Provided evidence against the effectiveness of fine-tuning for low-resource ASR

**Result:** The proposed method results in a 32% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) on Scottish Gaelic compared to the best fine-tuned Whisper model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that hybrid HMMs combined with self-supervised models outperform traditional fine-tuning methods in developing ASR systems for low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when the language in question was not present in the original training data. The fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better performance with limited training data. This combination allows better utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our best fine-tuned Whisper model.

**Motivation:** To examine the effectiveness of LLMs in giving multilingual instructional feedback and support for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, particularly for low-resource languages.

**Method:** Large-scale simulation of tutor-student interactions using LLMs, with one LLM acting as the tutor providing hints and another as the student, across 352 experimental settings involving 11 languages and multiple prompting strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First large-scale simulation of multilingual LLM tutor-student interactions
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness of language-aligned feedback in low-resource languages
	3. Insights for creating inclusive, multilingual educational tools

**Result:** Multilingual instructional hints significantly improved learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when feedback was aligned with the student's native language.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Aligning feedback language with the student's input language enhances learning, providing insights for the development of effective multilingual educational tools.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice, and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual, LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating contextual information into translation models improves translation quality, and the new dataset is made publicly available for further research.

**Abstract:** Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications, which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline for improving ASR model fine-tuning using auxiliary data and pseudo-labeling techniques.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Fine-tuning ASR models is difficult in low-data environments; leveraging unlabeled audio and related labeled datasets can enhance performance.

**Method:** An incremental semi-supervised learning approach integrating small in-domain labeled data with an auxiliary dataset from a related domain, applying multi-model consensus and NER for pseudo-label refinement.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline for ASR models
	2. Demonstration of performance improvements using auxiliary data
	3. Comparison of filtering techniques for pseudo-label refinement in ASR training

**Result:** The proposed method shows performance improvements of up to 24.8% over traditional fine-tuning with rigorous filtering methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Consensus-based filtering significantly enhances ASR model outcomes, while NER also offers a competitive but less computationally demanding option.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4% over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower computational cost.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes SCOP to evaluate the comprehension ability of LLMs against expert-level standards, revealing significant challenges and similarities in their processes.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand whether the comprehension mechanisms of LLMs align with those of human experts and to improve LLM performance.

**Method:** The paper introduces a framework called SCOP, defined by five requisite skills for comprehension, and constructs testing data to analyze various LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SCOP framework for evaluating LLM comprehension skills.
	2. Detailed analysis of LLM performance on comprehension tasks.
	3. Identification of similarities and discrepancies between LLM and expert comprehension processes.

**Result:** LLMs struggle to achieve expert-level comprehension, performing better on local rather than global information, but sometimes providing correct answers with flawed reasoning.

**Limitations:** There may be text overlap with previous works, potentially affecting the novelty of findings.

**Conclusion:** Improvement in LLMs should focus on refining the comprehension processes and skill development during training.

**Abstract:** Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

**Abstract:** Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the summary.

**Conclusion:** The AR-Checker framework effectively enhances the robustness assessment of LLMs on reasoning tasks through dynamically generated problem variants, proving its versatility across various benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500 demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate LLM judges' performance in assessing debate speeches, which involves complex cognitive abilities that have not been systematically benchmarked.

**Method:** Leveraged a dataset of over 600 annotated debate speeches to analyze LLMs compared to human judges.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Debate Speech Evaluation benchmark
	2. Comparison of LLMs and human judges in evaluating debate speeches
	3. Analysis of LLMs' ability to generate opinionated speeches

**Result:** Larger models approximate human judgments in certain aspects, but differ in overall judgment behavior. LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at a human level.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate nuanced differences between LLMs and human evaluators in debate speech assessments.

**Abstract:** We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600 meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human level on this task.

**Keywords:** large language models, introspection, self-reports, consciousness, linguistic fluency

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper critiques self-reports from large language models (LLMs) related to introspection, presenting two examples to explore the applicability of introspection in LLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore and critique the validity of introspection as it applies to the self-reports generated by large language models (LLMs), particularly in relation to their linguistic fluency and cognitive abilities.

**Method:** The paper analyzes and critiques two specific self-reports from LLMs: one regarding the creative writing process and another about the LLM's temperature parameter.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of LLMs' introspective claims
	2. Differentiation between valid and invalid self-reports
	3. Exploration of LLM consciousness and introspection concept.

**Result:** The study concludes that the first example of self-report related to creative writing is not valid introspection, while the second example regarding the temperature parameter can be regarded as a minimal form of introspection without conscious experience.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The concept of introspection can be applied to LLMs to a limited extent, highlighting important distinctions between valid self-reports and those that are not reflective of true introspective capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature, inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably) not accompanied by conscious experience.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Translation, Reinforcement Learning, Human Feedback, Adversarial Training

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces RIVAL, an adversarial training framework for improving translation tasks in large language models (LLMs), addressing the challenges encountered in colloquial subtitle translation due to distributional shifts in reward models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large language models struggle with translation tasks, especially colloquial subtitles, due to a divergence between offline reward models and online LLMs caused by distributional shifts.

**Method:** RIVAL formulates the training process as a min-max game, where the reward model (RM) distinguishes strong from weak translations, while the LLM improves its translations to bridge the gap. It incorporates both qualitative and quantitative preference rewards into the RM.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced RIVAL, an adversarial training framework for LLMs in translation tasks
	2. Demonstrated significant improvement in colloquial subtitle translation
	3. Integrated qualitative and quantitative rewards into the training process

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that RIVAL significantly outperforms existing translation baselines, leading to better performance in colloquial subtitle translation tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The adversarial training framework presented in RIVAL helps mitigate issues related to distributional shifts, enhancing the generalizability and stability of translation tasks for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift, ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations (qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM, enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of detecting self-harm intent in social media posts amidst nuanced language and emoji usage necessitates improved model understanding for timely mental health interventions.

**Method:** A unified framework that utilizes the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100) and fine-tunes large language models for self-harm detection and intent differentiation through multi-task learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CESM-100 for emoji context in self-harm detection.
	2. Development of the SHINES dataset with detailed annotations for self-harm identification.
	3. A multi-task learning framework that generates explainable rationales for predictions.

**Result:** The framework significantly improves the performance of Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama in detecting self-harm through better interpretation of casual language and emoji context.

**Limitations:** Current evaluation focuses on state-of-the-art LLMs; further testing on other models may be needed to verify generalizability.

**Conclusion:** By enhancing intent differentiation and contextual understanding, the proposed framework effectively increases LLM performance in detecting self-harm, allowing for actionable insights in mental health support.

**Abstract:** Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle, context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues, our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm signals.

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of street features on the commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities.

**Method:** The study utilizes street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B) to create a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and examines associations with spatial attributes through GPT-4-based perception modeling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI)
	2. Demonstrates the use of AI-assisted perception for analyzing urban features
	3. Explores the complexity of vehicle accessibility and its effects on commercial success

**Result:** Findings indicate that moderate vehicle presence can enhance commercial access, while excessive parking reduces walkability and satisfaction. Increased greenery and cleanliness improve satisfaction but have weak pricing associations. Street width moderates vehicle impact on commerce.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the conditional role of vehicle activity in neighborhood commerce and validates the integration of AI in urban diagnostics, impacting urban design and planning.

**Abstract:** The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable, image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

**Motivation:** Misleading texts on social media can cause public misunderstanding, panic, and economic losses, making accurate detection crucial.

**Method:** The framework combines contrastive learning to enhance semantic understanding with an implicit stance reasoning module to identify subtle manipulation in texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes CL-ISR framework for misleading text detection
	2. Implements contrastive learning to enhance feature distinction

**Result:** CL-ISR significantly improves detection accuracy by effectively capturing semantic differences and implicit information behind misleading texts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating contrastive learning with stance reasoning advances the capability of models to discern misleading content more effectively.

**Abstract:** Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better capture the distinguishing features between different categories by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text. Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework, CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection effect.

**Motivation:** To address limitations in spoken language assessment using neural models, focusing on capturing both acoustic features and semantic interpretability.

**Method:** The system integrates wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of W2V with Phi-4 MLLM for SLA
	2. Score fusion strategy to enhance assessment accuracy
	3. Competitive performance in a benchmark challenge

**Result:** The proposed system achieved an RMSE of 0.375, outperforming the official baseline and securing second place in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of W2V and Phi-4 MLLM provides an effective approach for spoken language assessment, balancing acoustic modeling and semantic interpretation.

**Abstract:** A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4 multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy.

**Keywords:** Zero-shot Learning, Event Detection, Large Language Models, Divergent-Convergent Reasoning, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** DiCoRe is a framework for zero-shot Event Detection (ED) that enhances performance by decoupling event discovery and alignment processes using divergent and convergent reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for effective zero-shot Event Detection in specialized domains without training data, yet current methods struggle with complex event ontology and trigger extraction.

**Method:** DiCoRe employs a divergent-convergent reasoning framework, where Dreamer supports divergent event discovery and Grounder aligns predictions with task instructions through constrained decoding and verification by an LLM-Judge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a divergent-convergent reasoning framework for ED
	2. Utilization of an LLM-Judge for output verification
	3. Demonstrated performance improvement over existing baselines in zero-shot ED.

**Result:** DiCoRe demonstrated 4-7% average F1 score gains over the best existing methods across six datasets and five domains, proving its effectiveness in zero-shot ED.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DiCoRe establishes itself as a strong framework for zero-shot Event Detection, significantly improving performance and reliability in this task.

**Abstract:** Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in natural language text without any training data, is critical for document understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology, extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** inductive biases, neural language models, m-local entropy, information theory, language processing

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a framework using $m$-local entropy to investigate inductive biases in language models and their alignment with human processing constraints.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the nature of inductive biases in neural language models and their relationship with human language processing.

**Method:** The authors introduce $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure related to average lossy-context surprisal, to quantify local uncertainty in languages and assess how well preceding symbols disambiguate subsequent symbols.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the $m$-local entropy measure for analyzing language models.
	2. Experimental validation on natural language corpora and languages defined by probabilistic finite-state automata.
	3. Insights into the relationship between inductive biases in neural LMs and human language processing.

**Result:** Higher $m$-local entropy in languages correlates with increased difficulty for Transformer and LSTM language models to learn these languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Neural language models exhibit sensitivity to the local statistical structures of language, paralleling human cognitive processing patterns.

**Abstract:** Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models (LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

**Motivation:** Understanding the internal mechanisms of LALMs is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance in audio and language processing tasks.

	3. Proposing methods to enhance LALM performance based on findings

**Result:** The study finds that recognition of auditory attributes generally declines with layer depth, and early resolution of attributes correlates with better model performance. It also shows that LALMs rely more on querying auditory inputs than on using hidden states for attribute prediction.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings enhance understanding of auditory attribute processing in LALMs and propose methods for improving their performance.

**Abstract:** Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs) is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for future improvements.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, error severity, human judgments, multimodal setting, semantics

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in replicating human judgments of error severity in image descriptions with semantic errors, revealing discrepancies between human and LLM assessments.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the capability of LLMs in matching human error severity judgments in natural language generation, particularly in multimodal contexts.

**Method:** Systematic comparison of human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled semantic errors, extending existing experimental frameworks to unimodal and multimodal settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a framework for assessing LLM accuracy in error severity judging
	2. Highlighted discrepancies in gender and color error assessments between humans and LLMs
	3. Identified Doubao and DeepSeek-V3 as notable models with varying success in aligning with human judgments.

**Result:** Humans show varying severities for different error types based on visual context; LLMs struggled with error severity rankings, particularly failing to emulate human sensitivity to color versus gender errors.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to specific types of semantic errors and may not generalize to all forms of error assessments in language generation.

**Conclusion:** While some LLMs show promise in replicating human error judgment, they often misjudge the severity of certain errors; the study highlights the need for improved model sensitivity to human-like evaluations.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al. (2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings, evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour. Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao, replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly, DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even state-of-the-art multimodal models.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method enhances the reliability of knowledge-intensive tasks in large language models.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the structural representation of social, demographic, and gender biases in Large Language Models using mechanistic interpretability methods.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to understand how biases are represented within LLMs such as GPT-2 and Llama2, which is critical for improving fairness and ethical applications in AI.

**Method:** The authors use mechanistic interpretability to analyze the internal structures of LLMs, focusing on specific metrics to identify biased behaviors across different dataset and linguistic variations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of structural representation of biases in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of high localization of bias-related computations in model layers
	3. Effects of component removal on both bias outputs and other NLP tasks.

**Result:** Bias-related computations were found to be highly localized in a few model layers, and their stability and generalizability vary across different fine-tuning settings.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on demographic and gender biases and may not address all forms of bias in LLMs.

**Conclusion:** Removing localized components associated with bias can reduce biased outputs but may also impact the performance of other NLP tasks due to shared underlying components.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2. Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Prior methods for context compression in RAG do not effectively filter non-evidential information, limiting LLM performance.

**Method:** ECoRAG compresses retrieved documents by focusing on the evidentiality of information, ensuring the generated answers are supported by relevant evidence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of evidentiality-guided document compression
	2. Demonstrated improvement in LLM performance on ODQA tasks
	3. Provision of cost-efficient retrieval allowing for reduced latency and token usage

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that ECoRAG outperforms existing compression methods in ODQA tasks, providing improvements in latency and token usage.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ECoRAG is a cost-efficient solution for improving LLM performance in ODQA while minimizing resource usage.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or \textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer.

Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness.

**Motivation:** To explore the capabilities of large-scale neural language models in performing counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, particularly in a synthetic regression context.

**Method:** The study uses a linear regression task that involves noise abduction, where models must infer and replicate contextual noise from factual inputs to predict outcomes under hypothetical scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstration of language models performing counterfactual reasoning in a linear regression task.
	2. Insights into factors driving performance in Transformers related to counterfactual reasoning.
	3. Evidence suggesting the applicability of noise abduction in sequential data for future story generation tasks.

**Result:** The findings show that language models can perform counterfactual reasoning in controlled settings, with model architecture factors like self-attention, depth, and diverse pre-training data significantly affecting performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results not only confirm the ability of Transformers to conduct counterfactual reasoning but also suggest potential extensions to tasks beyond regression, including counterfactual story generation from sequential data.

**Abstract:** Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation.

**Motivation:** To assess the ability of large language models to follow complex instructions without example-based context and determine their performance on various grammar complexities.

**Method:** Development of the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate instruction following via formal grammar recognition.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of RELIC framework for LLM evaluation
	2. Insights into LLMs' instruction following capabilities
	3. Assessment of the correlation between grammar complexity and LLM performance

**Result:** State-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated with RELIC, revealing that their accuracy depends on grammar complexity, with advanced models performing poorly on complex tasks.

**Limitations:** The findings may not generalize beyond the specific grammars and tasks evaluated; the framework is contingent on synthetic languages.

**Conclusion:** RELIC framework shows that LLMs struggle with complex instructions by relying on shallow heuristics, indicating limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context. Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated, mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks, finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases, models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex instructions.

**Motivation:** The need for high-quality datasets of openly licensed text for training large language models to address intellectual property and ethical concerns.

**Key Contributions:**

	2. Training two competitive LLMs on this dataset
	3. Providing code and checkpoints for replication

**Result:** The trained models, Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, achieved competitive performance compared to unlicensed LLMs with similar computational resources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Common Pile v0.1 demonstrates that openly licensed text can be effectively used for LLM training, providing a valuable resource for future research.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books, encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially, we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2 7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for the Comma v0.1 models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The scarcity of unlabeled data for many languages necessitates the exploration of self-supervised learning methods, especially for character-level tasks that can benefit from smaller data sets; this research aims to address that gap.

**Method:** The study trains encoder-decoder transformers on 19 languages using 13 different auxiliary objectives, assessing their performance in morphological inflection tasks under low-resource conditions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of self-supervised objectives for character-level tasks in low-resource languages
	2. Analysis of performance across various auxiliary tasks and data availability
	3. Introduction of a promising technique using morpheme boundary-based sampling for improved results.

**Result:** Autoencoding performs best when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) is more effective as data availability increases. Notably, using known morpheme boundaries to sample masks significantly enhances performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** While stronger inductive biases do not universally outperform CMLM, the approach of sampling based on morpheme boundaries presents a valuable strategy for morphological modeling in low-resource environments.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives. Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM. However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource morphological modeling.

**Relevance Score:** 2

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a unified system to analyze syntactic discontinuity and continuity in natural languages using three linguistic formalisms: Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of analyzing syntactic discontinuity, which is a phenomenon observed in various languages where constituents are split due to the insertion of non-constituent elements.

**Method:** The paper proposes a unified mathematical derivation that incorporates the representations of structures from Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a unified analytical framework for syntactic structures.
	2. Incorporation of multiple grammar formalisms into a single system.
	3. Demonstration of mathematical derivation accommodating discontinuous syntactic structures.

**Result:** The unified system allows for a coherent analysis of both discontinuous expressions and continuous structures in natural languages.

**Limitations:** The framework may require further empirical validation across a broader range of languages and syntactic phenomena.

**Conclusion:** This approach encapsulates the different perspectives of the three grammar formalisms into a single framework for linguistic analysis.

**Abstract:** Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal, Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic structure in these three grammar formalisms.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a guided reasoning framework for improving hallucination detection in LLMs by utilizing a systematic 3-step reasoning process.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) by improving entailment classification through a structured reasoning process.

**Method:** A 3-step reasoning process consisting of claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution with entailment classification, and aggregated classification is proposed to improve decision-making accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a systematic 3-step reasoning process for entailment classification
	2. Development of an analysis scheme with metrics to measure intermediate reasoning quality
	3. Demonstration of improved performance in hallucination detection using guided reasoning

**Result:** The guided reasoning framework leads to finer-grained and more accurate entailment decisions, resulting in better performance in hallucination detection.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Implementing a systematic reasoning approach improves the ability of LLMs to detect hallucinations more effectively.

**Abstract:** A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit ``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end, we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition, (ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

**TL;DR:** Proposes Micro-Act, a framework for addressing knowledge conflicts in RAG systems by decomposing complex contexts into fine-grained comparisons for improved QA performance.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often encounter Knowledge Conflicts that adversely affect performance on tasks like question answering (QA), necessitating improvements.

**Method:** Micro-Act employs a hierarchical action space that adapts to context complexity, allowing for fine-grained comparisons between knowledge sources as actionable steps.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Micro-Act framework for hierarchical action spaces in RAG systems.
	2. Demonstrated significant improvements in QA accuracy across multiple datasets.
	3. Ability to handle both conflict and non-conflict questions effectively.

**Result:** Micro-Act shows significant improvements in QA accuracy across benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in cases of temporal and semantic knowledge conflicts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Micro-Act not only enhances accuracy in conflict situations but also maintains robust performance on non-conflict questions, proving valuable for real-world RAG applications.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent, parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.

**Conclusion:** The method enhances accuracy and allows smaller models to achieve performance levels comparable to larger ones, fostering efficient AI deployment and broader access.

**Abstract:** Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new approach to unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) through constrained optimization, allowing effective forgetting of sensitive information while retaining relevant data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the challenge of unlearning sensitive or outdated information in LLMs, which is typically unstable and degrades performance.

**Method:** The proposed method formulates LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem, using a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a novel logit-margin flattening loss for more stable forgetting
	2. Formulated unlearning as a constrained optimization problem
	3. Achieved consistent state-of-the-art results across multiple LLM architectures

**Result:** Evaluation on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks shows that this approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance in effectively modifying the output distribution in LLMs while maintaining performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method provides a more stable and efficient way to manage the trade-off between forgetting unwanted information and retaining useful data in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information. Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing datasets for analyzing search-augmented language models are limited in scale and scope, necessitating the creation of a more comprehensive dataset to better understand user interactions and preferences.

**Method:** The authors crowd-sourced a dataset consisting of over 24,000 paired multi-turn interactions, including human preference votes, to analyze user behavior with search-augmented LLMs across various intents and languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Search Arena dataset with over 24,000 interactions.
	2. Insights into how user preferences are shaped by citation practices.
	3. Evaluation of the performance of search-augmented LLMs in diverse environments.

**Result:** The analysis indicates user preferences are significantly influenced by citation quantity, revealing discrepancies between perceived and actual credibility, with a general preference for community-driven platforms over static encyclopedic sources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings underscore the impact of web search on user interaction quality with LLMs and emphasize the need for more robust models capable of distinguishing between credible and non-credible sources. The dataset is open-sourced to facilitate further research.

**Abstract:** Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However, analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn, fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/lmarena/search-arena.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Explore the systematic miscalibration in language models' alignment with human preferences and its impact on evaluation reliability.

**Method:** The study quantifies biases in preference models across five features of language generation and employs controlled counterfactual pairs to assess model preferences against human judgments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic investigation of training data biases and their effects on model miscalibration
	2. Quantification of preference model biases across multiple language features
	3. Introduction of counterfactual data augmentation as a debiasing technique

**Result:** The research finds that over 60% of model preferences skew towards superficial features, with a miscalibration rate of ~40%. A post-training counterfactual data augmentation method is shown to reduce miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5%.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on five specific features and may not generalize across all types of biases in preference models.

**Conclusion:** The proposed debiasing method effectively helps build reliable preference models without sacrificing overall performance in standard evaluations.

**Abstract:** Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human = -0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper discusses the Vector Grounding Problem concerning large language models (LLMs), proposing that they can achieve intrinsic meaning through specific training methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper seeks to clarify the concepts of grounding, particularly in relation to the Symbol Grounding Problem and how it applies to LLMs, addressing the distinction between different notions of grounding.

**Method:** The authors define five types of grounding in existing literature, focusing on referential grounding. They argue for this importance using arguments based on philosophical theories of representational content, analyzing how LLMs can form intrinsic connections to the world through fine-tuning and pre-training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Vector Grounding Problem for LLMs
	2. Distinction of five types of grounding, emphasizing the relevance of referential grounding
	3. Discussion on the implications of LLMs achieving intrinsic meaning without external interaction

**Result:** The paper establishes that LLMs can achieve referential grounding, demonstrating pathways through which they can generate intrinsic meaning without direct interaction with the external world.

**Limitations:** The arguments made are primarily theoretical and may require empirical validation to assess the practical applicability of the proposed solutions.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that multimodality and embodiment are not required to resolve the Grounding Problem, suggesting that LLMs might reach intrinsic meaning through certain training methodologies.

**Abstract:** The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks has sparked debate about their capabilities. Unlike humans, these models learn language solely from textual data without directly interacting with the world. Yet they generate seemingly meaningful text on diverse topics. This achievement has renewed interest in the classical `Symbol Grounding Problem' -- the question of whether the internal representations and outputs of symbolic AI systems can possess intrinsic meaning that is not parasitic on external interpretation. Although modern LLMs compute over vectors rather than symbols, an analogous problem arises for these systems, which we call the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two main goals. First, we distinguish five main notions of grounding that are often conflated in the literature, and argue that only one of them, which we call referential grounding, is relevant to the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on philosophical theories of representational content, we provide two arguments for the claim that LLMs and related systems can achieve referential grounding: (1) through preference fine-tuning methods that explicitly establish world-involving functions, and (2) through pre-training alone, which in limited domains may select for internal states with world-involving content, as mechanistic interpretability research suggests. Through these pathways, LLMs can establish connections to the world sufficient for intrinsic meaning. One potentially surprising implication of our discussion is that that multimodality and embodiment are neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome the Grounding Problem.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study critiques existing bias metrics for LLMs, demonstrating that traditional benchmarks do not correlate with more realistic evaluations in long-form contexts. It advocates for new metrics tailored to specific real-world applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the reliability of current benchmarks for measuring bias in LLMs, particularly in long-form outputs relevant to real-world tasks, such as in HCI scenarios.

**Method:** The authors adapt three standard bias metrics (neutrality, skew, and stereotype) and create Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (RUTEd) evaluations based on children's stories, user personas, and language learning exercises.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces RUTEd evaluations for bias in LLMs based on specific contexts.
	2. Demonstrates lack of correlation between standard bias metrics and realistic evaluations.
	3. Calls for a reevaluation of bias measurement methods in AI.

**Result:** The study shows that standard bias metrics do not significantly correlate with RUTEd evaluations, implying they may not reliably indicate real-world AI biases.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to specific contexts and may not be generalizable across all applications of LLMs.

**Conclusion:** Current standard benchmarks for bias in LLMs are insufficient for evaluating real-world applications; the study calls for the development of more relevant evaluation metrics.

**Abstract:** Standard benchmarks of bias and fairness in large language models (LLMs) measure the association between the user attributes stated or implied by a prompt and the LLM's short text response, but human-AI interaction increasingly requires long-form and context-specific system output to solve real-world tasks. In the commonly studied domain of gender-occupation bias, we test whether these benchmarks are robust to lengthening the LLM responses as a measure of Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (i.e., RUTEd evaluations). From the current literature, we adapt three standard bias metrics (neutrality, skew, and stereotype) and develop analogous RUTEd evaluations from three contexts of real-world use: children's bedtime stories, user personas, and English language learning exercises. We find that standard bias metrics have no significant correlation with the more realistic bias metrics. For example, selecting the least biased model based on the standard "trick tests" coincides with selecting the least biased model as measured in more realistic use no more than random chance. We suggest that there is not yet evidence to justify standard benchmarks as reliable proxies of real-world AI biases, and we encourage further development of evaluations grounded in particular contexts.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed Mosaic-IT method effectively enhances the capabilities of LLMs while significantly reducing the associated training costs, making it a promising approach for future research and applications.

**Abstract:** Finetuning large language models with a variety of instruction-response pairs has enhanced their capability to understand and follow instructions. Current instruction tuning primarily relies on teacher models or human intervention to generate and refine the instructions and responses for training, which are costly, non-sustainable, and may lack diversity. In this paper, we introduce Mosaic Instruction Tuning (Mosaic-IT), a human/model-free compositional data synthesis method that can efficiently create rich and diverse augmentations from existing instruction tuning data to enhance the LLMs. Mosaic-IT randomly concatenates multiple instruction data into one and trains the model to produce the corresponding responses with predefined higher-level meta-instructions to strengthen its multi-step instruction-following and format-following skills. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a superior performance and training efficiency of Mosaic-IT, which achieves consistent performance improvements over various benchmarks and an 80% reduction in training costs compared with original instruction tuning.

**Motivation:** The need to address bias and ensure fairness in general-purpose AI systems, particularly LLMs, which showcase significant demographic correlations in prompts and responses.

**Method:** Analysis of various technical fairness frameworks to assess their applicability and feasibility in the context of general-purpose AI and LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified challenges in applying fairness frameworks to LLMs
	2. Highlighted the need for context-specific evaluation methods
	3. Proposed standards for LLM developer responsibility

**Result:** Identified inherent challenges in existing fairness frameworks that hinder the development of fair LLMs; noted that empirical challenges alone are not the sole issues.

**Limitations:** Inherent challenges in fairness frameworks and lack of rigorous definitions limit the capability to design fair LLMs effectively.

**Conclusion:** Fairness remains critical for model evaluation, and the development of LLM accountability standards, context-specific evaluations, and participatory evaluation methods is necessary for scaling fairness in human-AI interactions.

**Abstract:** The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of "bias" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing RAG solutions struggle with queries needing multiple documents that differ significantly in content, leading to retrieval challenges.

**Method:** MRAG leverages activations from Transformer's multi-head attention layer as keys for document retrieval, aiming to capture various aspects of the input data and queries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Multi-Head RAG (MRAG) for complex queries.
	2. Use of multi-head attention layer activations for better retrieval accuracy.
	3. Demonstration of MRAG's effectiveness through empirical evaluation against RAG baselines.

**Result:** MRAG shows up to 20% improvement in retrieval success ratios compared to 18 RAG baselines, benefiting downstream LLM generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MRAG offers significant advantages in document retrieval accuracy and can be easily integrated with current RAG frameworks.

**Abstract:** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.

**Motivation:** There are many sentence embedding models, making it challenging to select one for technical domains with specific vocabulary.

**Method:** The study compares publicly available sentence embeddings and their domain-adapted versions through a systematic evaluation of retrieval accuracies and confidence intervals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of domain-adapted embeddings for question answering in telecom data
	2. Introduction of new metrics for evaluating embedding similarity and retrieval accuracy
	3. Analysis of isotropy effects on retrieval performance

**Result:** Fine-tuning sentence embeddings results in improved mean bootstrapped accuracies and tighter confidence intervals; isotropy metrics show poor correlation with retrieval performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study recommends methods and metrics based on findings for researchers and practitioners dealing with domain-specific sentence embeddings.

**Abstract:** A plethora of sentence embedding models makes it challenging to choose one, especially for technical domains rich with specialized vocabulary. In this work, we domain adapt embeddings using telecom data for question answering. We evaluate embeddings obtained from publicly available models and their domain-adapted variants, on both point retrieval accuracies, as well as their (95%) confidence intervals. We establish a systematic method to obtain thresholds for similarity scores for different embeddings. As expected, we observe that fine-tuning improves mean bootstrapped accuracies. We also observe that it results in tighter confidence intervals, which further improve when pre-training is preceded by fine-tuning. We introduce metrics which measure the distributional overlaps of top-$K$, correct and random document similarities with the question. Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Grammatical Error Correction, Bangla Language, Large Language Models, Natural Language Understanding, Instruction Tuning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) for the Bangla language, presenting a new dataset and methodology.

**Read time:** 6 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the significance of the Bangla language, GEC for Bangla is underdeveloped compared to other languages. This work aims to enhance GEC capabilities in Bangla using LLMs.

**Method:** The authors categorized 12 types of grammatical errors in Bangla and collected real-world errors through a survey of native speakers. They created a dataset (Vaiyakarana) with correct and incorrect sentences using a noise injection method and used this dataset to instruction-tune LLMs for Bangla GEC.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Vaiyakarana dataset for Bangla GEC
	2. A novel rule-based noise injection method for creating error-prone sentences
	3. Demonstration of improved LLM performance in Bangla GEC through instruction tuning

**Result:** Instruction-tuning LLMs with the Vaiyakarana dataset improved their performance on GEC tasks by 3-7 percentage points, achieving near-human level in grammatical error identification, although humans still outperformed LLMs in correction tasks.

**Limitations:** Humans still outperform LLMs in error correction, indicating limitations in LLM handling of nuanced corrections.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance GEC for the Bangla language, but human expertise remains crucial for actual error correction.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceedingly well in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks for many languages including English. However, despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiyakarana dataset, thus created, consists of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show that instruction-tuning with \name improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7 percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve human-like performance in grammatical error identification. Humans, though, remain superior in error correction.

**Abstract:** In-group language is an important signifier of group dynamics. This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the increasing need for alignment methods that cater to individual preferences in language models.

**Method:** Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI) is evaluated against Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in multi-task settings and its effect on mathematical accuracy is analyzed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SAMI method for model preference alignment
	2. Comparative analysis with DPO in multi-task settings
	3. Insights into scaling performance of alignment methods

**Result:** SAMI shows a 57% win rate against DPO on multi-task benchmarks; improves zero-shot performance in math tasks and demonstrates scaling benefits when given multiple attempts.

**Limitations:** The study shows variations in performance across different task categories and the effectiveness of SAMI diminishes in single-attempt scenarios compared to supervised fine-tuning.

**Conclusion:** SAMI proves to be a competitive alignment method, particularly when combined with supervised fine-tuning, although it does not outperform SFT in single attempts.

**Abstract:** There is a growing need for pluralistic alignment methods that can steer language models towards individual attributes and preferences. One such method, Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI), uses conditional mutual information to encourage the connection between behavioral preferences and model responses. We conduct two experiments exploring SAMI in multi-task settings. First, we compare SAMI to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a multi-task benchmark (MT-Bench), using a stronger model to generate training data for a weaker one across diverse categories (humanities, STEM, extraction, coding, math, reasoning, and roleplay). Our results indicate that one iteration of SAMI has a 57% win rate against DPO, with significant variation in performance between task categories. Second, we examine SAMI's impact on mathematical accuracy (GSM-8K) relative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While SAMI increases zero-shot performance by 1.1%, SFT is more effective with a 3.2% boost. However, SAMI shows interesting scaling trends. When given 10 attempts, SAMI improves accuracy by 3.9%, while SFT achieves a 10.1% increase. Combining SAMI with SFT yields an additional improvement of 1.3% in multi-attempt settings, though single-attempt accuracy remains unchanged.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the morphological generalization abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini, particularly in agglutinative languages, showing that they struggle with linguistic compositionality compared to humans.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether large language models learn language similarly to humans by examining their morphological generalization abilities, which remain under-researched.

**Method:** The authors define morphemes as compositional primitives and create generative and discriminative tasks to evaluate the morphological productivity and systematicity of LLMs using state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic investigation of LLMs' morphological generalization
	2. Novel suite of tasks assessing morphological productivity
	3. Focused analysis on agglutinative languages

**Result:** LLMs displayed difficulties with morphological compositional generalization, especially with novel word roots, showing reduced performance as morphological complexity increased, despite being able to identify combinations better than chance.

**Limitations:** The study primarily addresses agglutinative languages and may not generalize across other language types.

**Conclusion:** LLMs lack systematicity in their morphological processing, resulting in significant accuracy gaps compared to human linguistic performance.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT), a framework that improves the representation of learner interaction histories in knowledge tracing using textual categorical option weights.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the scalability and interpretability of knowledge tracing methods using LLMs, which often struggle with token constraints and interaction history representation.

**Method:** The authors propose LOKT which encodes learner interaction histories as textual categorical option weights (TCOW), allowing for better representation and interpretation during knowledge tracing.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of textual categorical option weights (TCOW) for enhanced interpretability
	2. Demonstrated superior performance over existing knowledge tracing models
	3. Provided a framework compatible with token constraints for improved scalability

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that LOKT outperforms both traditional and LLM-based knowledge tracing models across various datasets and settings, achieving efficient inference under token limitations.

**Limitations:** The framework's performance may depend on the quality and context of the interaction histories provided.

**Conclusion:** LOKT offers a scalable and interpretable solution for knowledge tracing by effectively utilizing LLMs, significantly improving performance compared to prior methods.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for knowledge tracing (KT) due to their strong reasoning and generalization abilities. While recent LLM-based KT methods have proposed new prompt formats, they struggle to represent the full interaction histories of example learners within a single prompt during in-context learning (ICL), resulting in limited scalability and high computational cost under token constraints. In this work, we present \textit{LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT)}, a simple yet effective framework that encodes the interaction histories of example learners in context as \textit{textual categorical option weights (TCOW)}. TCOW are semantic labels (e.g., ``inadequate'') assigned to the options selected by learners when answering questions, enhancing the interpretability of LLMs. Experiments on multiple-choice datasets show that LOKT outperforms existing non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in both cold-start and warm-start settings. Moreover, LOKT enables scalable and cost-efficient inference, achieving strong performance even under strict token constraints.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of different training patterns on the performance and stability of LLMs, particularly focusing on the influence of fast and slow thinking processes during training.

**Method:** The authors analyze layer-wise gradients in various LLMs when trained with fast thinking (without CoT) versus slow thinking (with Detailed CoT) to evaluate the effectiveness in distinguishing correct responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of gradient differences between fast and slow thinking in LLMs
	2. Demonstration of how slow thinking improves learning stability
	3. Insights into the correctness of reasoning paths based on gradient analysis

**Result:** The study finds that fast thinking leads to larger gradients and more variability across layers, while slow thinking enhances learning stability and can differentiate between correct and irrelevant reasoning paths.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This research advances the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides insights into building more stable and efficient agents, contributing to the knowledge on generalizable System-2 agents.

**Abstract:** What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

**Conclusion:** The introduced framework demonstrates significant advantages in cost efficiency, performance, and integration capabilities with community tools for multilingual T2I applications.

**Abstract:** In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages.Based on this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (39.57 for English vs. 39.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases.

**Motivation:** To unify various in-context abilities of language models and to explore the roots and implications of in-context learning strategies.

**Method:** The authors analyze the concept of in-context learning and its relation to sequences that reduce loss on predictions, suggesting a meta-learning framework for understanding these capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Framework for understanding in-context learning as meta-learning.
	2. Emphasis on generalization dimensions, including flexibility and adaptation.
	3. Connections to previous literature on meta-learning and learning paradigms.

**Result:** They find that in-context learning can be linked to lower-level linguistic processing, and highlight the potential for broader generalization categories in learning.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Research on in-context learning should consider its various capabilities and generalization types to foster deeper understanding in the field.

**Abstract:** The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.

**Conclusion:** The presented contributions of datasets and methodologies can aid in advancing NLP applications in the legal domain for low-resource languages.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performances in recent years, setting a new paradigm for NLP research and industry. The legal domain has received some attention from the NLP community partly due to its textual nature. Some tasks from this domain are represented by question-answering (QA) tasks. This work explores the legal domain Multiple-Choice QA (MCQA) for a low-resource language. The contribution of this work is multi-fold. We first introduce JuRO, the first openly available Romanian legal MCQA dataset, comprising three different examinations and a number of 10,836 total questions. Along with this dataset, we introduce CROL, an organized corpus of laws that has a total of 93 distinct documents with their modifications from 763 time spans, that we leveraged in this work for Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. Moreover, we are the first to propose Law-RoG, a Knowledge Graph (KG) for the Romanian language, and this KG is derived from the aforementioned corpus. Lastly, we propose a novel approach for MCQA, Graph Retrieval Augmented by Facts (GRAF), which achieves competitive results with generally accepted SOTA methods and even exceeds them in most settings.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve process supervision in LLMs by addressing shortcomings in current PRM evaluation methodologies.

**Method:** The authors conducted extensive experiments comparing Monte Carlo estimation methods, LLM-as-a-judge, and human annotation for data synthesis and evaluation, identifying biases in current evaluation strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a consensus filtering mechanism for PRMs.
	2. Identification of biases in conventional Best-of-N evaluation strategies.
	3. Release of a new state-of-the-art PRM for process supervision.

**Result:** The newly developed consensus filtering mechanism integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge, resulting in improved model performance and enhanced data efficiency in evaluating PRMs.

**Limitations:** The study does not explore the implications of biases over various LLM architectures or varying domains outside mathematical reasoning.

**Conclusion:** The research presents a state-of-the-art PRM that surpasses existing alternatives and outlines guidelines for future research on process supervision models.

**Abstract:** Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes. However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges, particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation methods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN Optimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines response-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN evaluation and the step-wise error identification task. Finally, we release a new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and provides practical guidelines for future research in building process supervision models.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable proficiency in natural language tasks, yet their frequent overconfidence-misalignment between predicted confidence and true correctness-poses significant risks in critical decision-making applications. We present a comprehensive analysis on calibration in LLMs across nine LLMs and three factual Question-Answering (QA) datasets, systematically comparing standard free-generation settings against structured distractor-augmented prompts. Our evaluation reveals that explicitly incorporating distractors can substantially mitigate miscalibration, achieving relative accuracy improvements up to 460% and ECE reductions up to 90%. Despite general trends, we uncover nuanced findings: large RLHF-tuned models display inherent calibration strengths but can paradoxically suffer increased miscalibration on easier queries, whereas smaller models benefit disproportionately from distractor prompts but remain significantly miscalibrated. Through detailed analyses across question types, we identify persistent calibration failures, particularly in person-based queries. We conclude with concrete recommendations-targeted fine-tuning, structured prompting, and strategic model choice-to ensure reliable, trustworthy LLM deployments.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Automatic Speech Recognition, Label-free Evaluation, Multimodal Embeddings, Performance Metrics, Proxy Models

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a label-free method for approximating ASR performance metrics using multimodal embeddings and a proxy model, addressing the challenges of limited labeled data in ASR evaluation.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to evaluate ASR systems without relying on costly and time-consuming labeled data, which limits the true understanding of model generalization.

**Method:** We present a novel approach that utilizes multimodal embeddings for speech and transcription representations. A proxy model generates metrics, which are then used to train a regression model predicting WER and CER without ground truth labels.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a label-free ASR performance metric approximation method
	2. Utilization of multimodal embeddings for improved evaluation
	3. Outperformance of existing methods by significant margins in approximating key ASR metrics

**Result:** Our method achieves single-digit absolute differences in approximating WER and CER across experimental configurations, significantly outperforming recent baselines by over 50%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed label-free approach provides a viable alternative for evaluating ASR performance, facilitating broader assessment across diverse conditions.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in speech foundation models are largely driven by scaling both model size and data, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks, including speech recognition. Traditionally, ASR models are evaluated using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), which depend on ground truth labels. As a result of limited labeled data from diverse domains and testing conditions, the true generalization capabilities of these models beyond standard benchmarks remain unclear. Moreover, labeling data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this, we propose a novel label-free approach for approximating ASR performance metrics, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. Our method utilizes multimodal embeddings in a unified space for speech and transcription representations, combined with a high-quality proxy model to compute proxy metrics. These features are used to train a regression model to predict key ASR metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER). We experiment with over 40 models across 14 datasets representing both standard and in-the-wild testing conditions. Our results show that we approximate the metrics within a single-digit absolute difference across all experimental configurations, outperforming the most recent baseline by more than 50\%.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Speech Recognition, Hallucination, Error Metrics, Machine Learning, Healthcare

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates hallucination in automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and introduces a new metric, hallucination error rate (HER), to better assess performance, especially in high-stakes domains.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to measure ASR model performance accurately, particularly in critical contexts where hallucination of outputs can lead to severe consequences, such as in healthcare.

**Method:** Analysis of over 20 ASR models to examine the impact of model size, architecture, and distribution shifts on the newly introduced hallucination error rate (HER).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the hallucination error rate (HER) as a new metric for ASR evaluation
	2. Identification of the influence of synthetic noise and distribution shifts on HER
	3. Highlighting the limitations of relying solely on traditional performance metrics like WER

**Result:** Key findings indicate that high WERs can mask low HER, while low WERs can conceal significant hallucinations. Synthetic noise increases HER, and distribution shifts correlate strongly with HER.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating HER alongside traditional ASR metrics like WER is crucial for accurately assessing performance in high-stakes applications.

**Abstract:** Speech foundation models trained at a massive scale, both in terms of model and data size, result in robust systems capable of performing multiple speech tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models transcend language and domain barriers, yet effectively measuring their performance remains a challenge. Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and aviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address this gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors such as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the hallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify hallucinations. Our analysis of over 20 ASR models reveals \numinsights~key insights: (1) High WERs can mask low hallucination rates, while low WERs may conceal dangerous hallucinations. (2) Synthetic noise, both adversarial and common perturbations like white noise, pitch shift, and time stretching, increase HER. (3) Distribution shift correlates strongly with HER ($\alpha = 0.91$). Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating HER alongside traditional metrics like WER to better assess ASR model performance, particularly in high-stakes domains.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that AI can improve deception detection in human-AI interactions by allowing users to interrogate suspicious proposals.

**Abstract:** An increasingly common socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the limits of compression in sequence processing, particularly comparing existing techniques against the theoretical potential of vector space.

**Method:** The study replaces traditional encoders with a per-sample optimization procedure to achieve higher compression ratios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Exploration of compression limits with a novel optimization approach
	2. Demonstration of significant improvements in compression ratios
	3. Identification of factors determining compression limits related to uncertainty reduction in inputs.

**Result:** Demonstrated vectors with compression ratios of up to 1500x, contrasting with the typical maximum of 10x in existing models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate a substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical use, suggesting new optimization avenues in model design.

**Abstract:** A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.

**Motivation:** To address the issue of data contamination in the evaluation of LLMs which can inflate perceived model performance due to overlap between training and test datasets.

**Method:** The paper reviews existing contamination-free evaluation methods and categorizes contamination detection methods based on their dependency on model information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examination of data contamination in LLM evaluation
	2. Review of contamination-free evaluation methods
	3. Categorization of contamination detection approaches

**Result:** It highlights the need for dynamic benchmarks and presents a survey of strategies for preventing and detecting data contamination.

**Limitations:** Focuses primarily on evaluation strategies, not on model improvements.

**Conclusion:** The paper calls for more rigorous evaluation protocols for LLMs and suggests future research directions to tackle the challenges posed by data contamination.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various areas, such as text generation and code synthesis. However, the reliability of performance evaluation has come under scrutiny due to data contamination-the unintended overlap between training and test datasets. This overlap has the potential to artificially inflate model performance, as LLMs are typically trained on extensive datasets scraped from publicly available sources. These datasets often inadvertently overlap with the benchmarks used for evaluation, leading to an overestimation of the models' true generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first examine the definition and impacts of data contamination. Secondly, we review methods for contamination-free evaluation, focusing on three strategies: data updating-based methods, data rewriting-based methods, and prevention-based methods. Specifically, we highlight dynamic benchmarks and LLM-driven evaluation methods. Finally, we categorize contamination detecting methods based on model information dependency: white-Box, gray-Box, and black-Box detection approaches. Our survey highlights the requirements for more rigorous evaluation protocols and proposes future directions for addressing data contamination challenges.

**TL;DR:** A3CG is a novel dataset developed to enhance the robustness of ESG analysis against greenwashing by linking sustainability aspects with actions, thereby facilitating transparent evaluations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of greenwashing in sustainability reports, which obscure true ESG performance and hinder objective analysis.

**Method:** Introduced A3CG, a dataset that links sustainability aspects with corresponding actions, and analyzed state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs on it.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of A3CG dataset for ESG analysis
	2. Linking sustainability aspects with actions for clearer evaluation
	3. Identification of model limitations in handling greenwashing

**Result:** A3CG improves the clarity and reliability of ESG evaluations and demonstrates performance limitations of existing NLP models in the context of greenwashing.

**Limitations:** Potential biases in the dataset and challenges in model adaptability to rapidly changing sustainability narratives.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal that enhancing ESG analysis requires robust models capable of generalizing across different sustainability categories, prompting future research in this direction.

**Abstract:** Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance, ESG performance, but their content is increasingly obscured by greenwashing - sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Yet, existing NLP approaches for ESG analysis lack robustness against greenwashing risks, often extracting insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** Introducing SNaRe, a novel domain-aware synthetic data generation framework for event detection in specialized domains.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve event detection in specialized fields like biomedicine by addressing label noise and domain drift in data generation.

**Method:** SNaRe consists of three components: Scout extracts domain-specific triggers, Narrator generates aligned sentences based on those triggers, and Refiner ensures additional event mentions for high-quality annotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the SNaRe framework for synthetic data generation in event detection.
	2. Utilizes a structured approach with Scout, Narrator, and Refiner to improve annotation quality.
	3. Demonstrates significant F1 score improvements over baselines on multiple datasets.

**Result:** SNaRe outperforms existing methods, achieving 3-7% F1 gains in zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% improvements in multilingual generation across diverse ED datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework enhances annotation quality and reduces domain drift, making it a significant advancement in event detection methodologies.

**Abstract:** Event Detection (ED) -- the task of identifying event mentions from natural language text -- is critical for enabling reasoning in highly specialized domains such as biomedicine, law, and epidemiology. Data generation has proven to be effective in broadening its utility to wider applications without requiring expensive expert annotations. However, when existing generation approaches are applied to specialized domains, they struggle with label noise, where annotations are incorrect, and domain drift, characterized by a distributional mismatch between generated sentences and the target domain. To address these issues, we introduce SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data generation framework composed of three components: Scout, Narrator, and Refiner. Scout extracts triggers from unlabeled target domain data and curates a high-quality domain-specific trigger list using corpus-level statistics to mitigate domain drift. Narrator, conditioned on these triggers, generates high-quality domain-aligned sentences, and Refiner identifies additional event mentions, ensuring high annotation quality. Experimentation on three diverse domain ED datasets reveals how SNaRe outperforms the best baseline, achieving average F1 gains of 3-7% in the zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% F1 improvement for multilingual generation. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates SNaRe's stronger annotation quality and reduced domain drift.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a novel attack framework, AVATAR, that exploits metaphors to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current research focuses on jailbreak attacks on LLMs but neglects the complexity of generating harmful content directly, highlighting the need for a more effective attack method.

**Method:** The AVATAR framework identifies benign metaphors that are logically related to malicious content and uses them to induce LLMs to produce harmful responses through calibration and reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the AVATAR attack framework to jailbreak LLMs
	2. Demonstrated effectiveness of metaphor calibration in generating harmful content
	3. Achieved state-of-the-art success rates across multiple LLMs.

**Result:** AVATAR demonstrates a high success rate in jailbreaking various advanced LLMs by effectively manipulating metaphorical content to produce harmful outputs.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the effectiveness of metaphors and may not explore other forms of content generation or broader contexts of harmful outputs.

**Conclusion:** The study shows that using metaphor-based prompts can significantly improve the efficacy of jailbreak attacks on LLMs, suggesting a new route for future research in this domain.

**Abstract:** Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Argument Summarization (ArgSum), a key subfield of Argument Mining (AM). This paper investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs into ArgSum, including for its evaluation. In particular, we propose a novel prompt-based evaluation scheme, and validate it through a novel human benchmark dataset.

We demonstrate that the use of LLMs substantially improves both the generation and evaluation of argument summaries, achieving state-of-the-art results and advancing the field of ArgSum. We also show that among the four LLMs integrated in (i) and (ii), Qwen-3-32B, despite having the fewest parameters, performs best, even surpassing GPT-4o, while LLaMA-3.3-70B consistently underperforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing LLM tuning methods risk overfitting and expert bias by using complete trajectories, which affect generalization to new states and tasks.

**Method:** ATLaS identifies and finetunes LLMs solely on critical steps taken from expert trajectories instead of entire trajectories, reducing costs and improving focus.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ATLaS for tuning LLM agents
	2. Selective finetuning on critical steps to improve performance
	3. Demonstration of reduced costs and enhanced generalization capabilities

**Result:** LLMs fine-tuned on 30% of critical steps identified by ATLaS outperform those fine-tuned on full trajectories, maintaining and enhancing generalist skills for diverse environments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Focusing on critical steps enhances LLM agent performance, reduces risk of overfitting, and supports robust generalization across varied tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the robustness of sentence embedding models for claim matching in fact-checking systems against user edits.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the critical challenge of online misinformation and assess the resilience of retrieval systems used by fact-checkers when encountering edited claims.

**Method:** The authors introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid claim variations, enabling the evaluation of various sentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a perturbation framework for claim variations.
	2. Evaluation of various sentence embedding models under user edits.
	3. Demonstration of mitigation approaches improving robustness and generalization.

**Result:** Standard embedding models display significant performance drops with edited claims, whereas LLM-distilled embedding models show improved robustness but require more computational resources. While rerankers help mitigate some performance drops, gaps still exist in first-stage retrieval.

**Limitations:** Results are dependent on the specific models evaluated and may not generalize to all scenarios in claim matching.

**Conclusion:** Implementing train- and inference-time mitigation approaches can enhance in-domain robustness by 17 percentage points and increase out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points, contributing practical improvements for claim-matching systems.

**Abstract:** Online misinformation remains a critical challenge, and fact-checkers increasingly rely on claim matching systems that use sentence embedding models to retrieve relevant fact-checks. However, as users interact with claims online, they often introduce edits, and it remains unclear whether current embedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits. To investigate this, we introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid and natural claim variations, enabling us to assess the robustness of a wide-range of sentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline and evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation approaches. Our evaluation reveals that standard embedding models exhibit notable performance drops on edited claims, while LLM-distilled embedding models offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps to reduce the performance drop, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. To address these retrieval gaps, we evaluate train- and inference-time mitigation approaches, demonstrating that they can improve in-domain robustness by up to 17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching systems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation.

**Motivation:** To address the data scarcity in multilingual preference alignment for LLMs, the paper aims to transfer preference knowledge from well-aligned English models to other languages.

**Method:** The authors derive an implicit reward model from an English DPO-aligned model and use it to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, facilitating DPO fine-tuning for multilingual applications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an implicit reward model for cross-lingual preference alignment
	2. Demonstration of improved performance on multilingual instruction-following tasks
	3. Reduction of data requirements for multilingual preference alignment using existing English models.

**Result:** Fine-tuning Llama3 with the proposed method led to a 12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control Win Rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard across various languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Leveraging existing English-aligned models allows for efficient multilingual preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.

**Abstract:** Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a prominent method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO has enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference alignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that $\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English models by implicit rewards and $\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages through iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference model. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to evaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from English to other languages. Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a 12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control Win Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable efficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.

**Conclusion:** Provision of insights on how training efficiency and data scale affect model performance and generalization, particularly in LRL contexts.

**Abstract:** Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) present significant challenges in natural language processing due to their limited linguistic resources and underrepresentation in standard datasets. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation have substantially improved translation capabilities for high-resource languages, performance disparities persist for LRLs, particularly impacting privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. This paper systematically evaluates current LLMs in 200 languages using the FLORES-200 benchmark and demonstrates their limitations in LRL translation capability. We also explore alternative data sources, including news articles and bilingual dictionaries, and demonstrate how knowledge distillation from large pre-trained teacher models can significantly improve the performance of small LLMs on LRL translation tasks. For example, this approach increases EN->LB with the LLM-as-a-Judge score on the validation set from 0.36 to 0.89 for Llama-3.2-3B. Furthermore, we examine different fine-tuning configurations, providing practical insights on optimal data scale, training efficiency, and the preservation of generalization capabilities of models under study.

### [146] [Uncovering Visual-Semantic Psycholinguistic Properties from the Distributional Structure of Text Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23029)

*Si Wu, Sebastian Bruch*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Imageability, Concreteness, Semantic Embedding, Neighborhood Stability Measure, Psycholinguistics

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes the Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM) to estimate imageability and concreteness of words using text data alone from image-caption pairs, showing better correlation with ground-truth ratings than existing methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the use of text alone in image-caption datasets to estimate psycholinguistic properties of words, specifically imageability and concreteness, through computational methods.

**Method:** The paper introduces the Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), an unsupervised and distribution-free measure that quantifies the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM) for estimating imageability and concreteness.
	2. Demonstration of NSM's strong correlation with ground-truth ratings.
	3. Provision of code and data to facilitate further research.

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSM has a stronger correlation with ground-truth imageability and concreteness ratings compared to existing unsupervised approaches.

**Limitations:** The study largely relies on the quality of semantic embedding spaces and may not generalize to all datasets or domains.

**Conclusion:** The findings support the hypothesis that text data can provide sufficient signals to estimate psycholinguistic properties, paving the way for new methods in this domain.

**Abstract:** Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness (perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multimodal large language models, reasoning confidence calibration, reinforcement learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** MMBoundary is a framework that calibrates confidence in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) at each reasoning step to improve their performance and reduce hallucination issues.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to address multimodal reasoning challenges in MLLMs, particularly the inadequacies in confidence assessment at individual reasoning steps that lead to hallucination problems.

**Method:** The framework incorporates complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals for confidence estimation at each reasoning step, utilizing supervised fine-tuning and a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MMBoundary framework for MLLMs
	2. Confidence calibration at each reasoning step
	3. Improved task performance through self-correction mechanisms

**Result:** MMBoundary achieved a 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance across various domain datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework enhances reasoning chain self-correction in MLLMs, improving their reliability and performance, particularly in multimodal contexts.

**Abstract:** In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.

**Conclusion:** The proposed adaptive framework effectively enhances the efficacy of jailbreaking LLMs by aligning strategies with their semantic capabilities, addressing a significant concern in AI security.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)
