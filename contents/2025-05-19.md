*Yun Ho, Romain Nith, Peili Jiang, Shan-Yuan Teng, Pedro Lopes*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** HCI, Electrical muscle stimulation, Context-aware systems, Machine learning, Wearable technology

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a flexible interactive electrical-muscle-stimulation (EMS) system that generates muscle stimulation instructions based on user context, enabling task flexibility without task-specific programming.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current EMS systems are highly specialized and non-contextual, limiting their applicability in dynamic situations. This work aims to create a more versatile EMS interface that can adapt to users' needs in real-time.

**Method:** The developed system uses spoken requests and images from the user's perspective, employing computer vision for object detection and large language models for reasoning, combined with biomechanical knowledge to create suitable muscle stimulation instructions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a flexible EMS system that adapts to user context
	2. Integration of computer vision and large language models for instruction generation
	3. Capacity to perform both novel and existing tasks without specific programming

**Result:** The system successfully generates context-aware muscle stimulation interactions, allowing for new capabilities (like opening child-proof bottles) while also replicating existing interactions without specific programming.

**Limitations:** The system may face challenges in accurately interpreting complex user contexts and ensuring safe muscle stimulation at all times.

**Conclusion:** This research indicates a significant advancement toward general-purpose EMS interfaces that accommodate contextual variations and enhance user assistance.

**Abstract:** Decades of interactive electrical-muscle-stimulation (EMS) revealed its promise as a wearable interface for physical assistance-EMS directly demonstrates movements through the users' body (e.g., shaking a spray-can before painting). However, interactive EMS-systems are highly-specialized because their feedback is (1) fixed (e.g., one program executes spray-can instructions, another executes piano instructions) and (2) non-contextual (e.g., using a spray-can while cooking likely involves cooking oil, not paint, and thus shaking is unnecessary). To address this, we explored a more flexible approach and engineered a system that generates muscle-stimulation-instructions given the user's context. Through our examples, we show that such a system is flexible: it enables unprecedented EMS-interactions (e.g., opening a child-proof pill bottle cap) but also replicates existing systems (e.g., shake a spray can)-all without requiring task-specific programming. To achieve this, our system takes in user's spoken-requests and images from their point of view. It uses computer vision (e.g., detect objects/handedness) and large-language-models (e.g., reason about objects/situations) to generate textual-instructions. Finally, these instructions are then constrained by biomechanical-knowledge (e.g., joint limits, kinematic-chain, EMS capabilities) to produce suitable muscle-stimulation gestures. We believe our concept marks a shift toward more general-purpose EMS-interfaces, enabling more flexible and context-aware assistance.

### [2] [It's only fair when I think it's fair: How Gender Bias Alignment Undermines Distributive Fairness in Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10661)

*Domenique Zipperling, Luca Deck, Julia Lanzl, Niklas KÃ¼hl*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Human-AI collaboration, Gender bias, Fairness perceptions

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper explores the impact of gender bias alignment on human-AI collaboration, specifically how perceptions of fairness influence reliance on AI recommendations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how gender bias in AI impacts human trust and acceptance of AI recommendations in consequential decision-making.

**Method:** A 2x2 between-subject study examining the interaction between gender bias alignment and perceptions of fairness in human-AI teams.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates the role of gender bias in human-AI collaboration
	2. Demonstrates the influence of fairness perceptions on AI reliance
	3. Highlights that formal fairness is insufficient without bias alignment

**Result:** Findings show that gender bias alignment affects fairness perceptions and reliance on AI, indicating that just designing a fair AI is not enough for effective collaboration.

**Limitations:** Focuses solely on gender bias; other biases may also influence perceptions and reliance.

**Conclusion:** Human reliance on AI recommendations decreases if biases do not align, emphasizing the need for both fair AI systems and aligned human perceptions.

**Abstract:** Human-AI collaboration is increasingly relevant in consequential areas where AI recommendations support human discretion. However, human-AI teams' effectiveness, capability, and fairness highly depend on human perceptions of AI. Positive fairness perceptions have been shown to foster trust and acceptance of AI recommendations. Yet, work on confirmation bias highlights that humans selectively adhere to AI recommendations that align with their expectations and beliefs -- despite not being necessarily correct or fair. This raises the question whether confirmation bias also transfers to the alignment of gender bias between human and AI decisions. In our study, we examine how gender bias alignment influences fairness perceptions and reliance. The results of a 2x2 between-subject study highlight the connection between gender bias alignment, fairness perceptions, and reliance, demonstrating that merely constructing a ``formally fair'' AI system is insufficient for optimal human-AI collaboration; ultimately, AI recommendations will likely be overridden if biases do not align.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces NeoLightning, a modern reinterpretation of the Buchla Lightning. NeoLightning preserves the innovative spirit of Don Buchla's "Buchla Lightning" (introduced in the 1990s) while making its gesture-based interaction accessible to contemporary users. While the original Buchla Lightning and many other historical instruments were groundbreaking in their time, they are now largely unsupported, limiting user interaction to indirect experiences. To address this, NeoLightning leverages MediaPipe for deep learning-based gesture recognition and employs Max/MSP and Processing for real-time multimedia processing. The redesigned system offers precise, low-latency gesture recognition and immersive 3D interaction. By merging the creative spirit of the original Lightning with modern advancements, NeoLightning redefines gesture-based musical interaction, expanding possibilities for expressive performance and interactive sound design.

### [4] [Creating General User Models from Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10831)

*Omar Shaikh, Shardul Sapkota, Shan Rizvi, Eric Horvitz, Joon Sung Park, Diyi Yang, Michael S. Bernstein*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction, General User Model, Multimodal Observations, Proactive Assistants, Intelligent Systems

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a general user model (GUM) architecture that learns user preferences from multimodal observations to enhance human-computer interaction.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of current user models which are fragmented and unable to understand user preferences and habits cohesively.

**Method:** The GUM architecture processes unstructured observations (like device screenshots) to create confidence-weighted propositions about user knowledge and preferences, revising these as more data is observed.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the General User Model (GUM) architecture.
	2. Application of multimodal observations for user understanding.
	3. Development of proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that execute actions based on inferred user preferences.

**Result:** GUMs can accurately infer user intentions and struggles from interaction data, enabling proactive assistants that perform actions without explicit user requests.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GUMs facilitate the development of interactive systems that anticipate user needs using multimodal context understanding, moving closer to the visions of seamless HCI.

**Abstract:** Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model (GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g., device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that capture that user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive systems that anticipate user needs.

### [5] [Alexandria: A Library of Pluralistic Values for Realtime Re-Ranking of Social Media Feeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10839)

*Akaash Kolluri, Renn Su, Farnaz Jahanbakhsh, Dora Zhao, Tiziano Piccardi, Michael S. Bernstein*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** social media algorithms, user values, content re-ranking, LLM, browser extension

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a library of 78 values for social media algorithms, addressing the limitations of engagement-focused ranking by implementing LLM-powered content classifiers for personalized feed re-ranking via a browser extension called Alexandria.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacies of social media feed ranking algorithms that overly focus on engagement, the authors propose a comprehensive set of values that can enhance user experience and well-being.

**Method:** Developed an extensive library of values and implemented it into LLM-powered classifiers which are integrated into a browser extension that re-ranks social media feeds based on user-selected values. The effectiveness was evaluated through qualitative and quantitative user studies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a library of 78 values for social media algorithms
	2. Development of the Alexandria browser extension for real-time feed re-ranking
	3. Demonstration of user engagement through qualitative and quantitative studies

**Result:** User studies showed that a larger library of values allows for more nuanced user preferences and enhances control over content displayed in social media feeds.

**Limitations:** The study was limited to specific platforms and may not generalize across all social media contexts or user demographics.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that incorporating a diverse range of values into social media ranking algorithms is feasible and beneficial for users, enabling personalized content delivery aligned with their individual values.

**Abstract:** Social media feed ranking algorithms fail when they too narrowly focus on engagement as their objective. The literature has asserted a wide variety of values that these algorithms should account for as well -- ranging from well-being to productive discourse -- far more than can be encapsulated by a single topic or theory. In response, we present a $\textit{library of values}$ for social media algorithms: a pluralistic set of 78 values as articulated across the literature, implemented into LLM-powered content classifiers that can be installed individually or in combination for real-time re-ranking of social media feeds. We investigate this approach by developing a browser extension, $\textit{Alexandria}$, that re-ranks the X/Twitter feed in real time based on the user's desired values. Through two user studies, both qualitative (N=12) and quantitative (N=257), we found that diverse user needs require a large library of values, enabling more nuanced preferences and greater user control. With this work, we argue that the values criticized as missing from social media ranking algorithms can be operationalized and deployed today through end-user tools.

**Abstract:** Adolescent girls face significant mental health challenges during their transition to adulthood, often experiencing heightened stress from various sources. While various interactive technologies for self-disclosure had been explored to support stress relief, little is known about how to encourage stress-related self-disclosure through an embodied approach. This study presents a co-design workshop centred on Embodied Probes, a series of artefacts and activities incorporating embodied methods and technologies. During the workshop, nine participants aged 15 to 18 engaged with their bodies, expressed bodily sensations through tangible means, and designed embodied prototypes tailored to their personal needs for stress perception and relief. The workshop revealed insights into somatic symptoms, sources, and coping strategies for stress among adolescent girls, as well as how embodied methods can support their stress self-disclosure. This paper contributes to the HCI community by offering design implications on leveraging embodied technologies to support self-disclosure for young women's mental well-being.

**Keywords:** Ultra-Wideband, privacy, Human-Robot Interaction, vital sign monitoring, Anti-Sensing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Anti-Sensing, a defense mechanism that uses oscillatory motion from wearable devices to disrupt UWB radar sensing of physiological data, enhancing privacy in healthcare applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address privacy concerns arising from the use of UWB radar technology for non-line-of-sight vital sign monitoring in healthcare, particularly in human-robot interactions.

**Method:** The approach introduces physically realizable perturbations that mimic natural cardiac motion to mislead heart rate estimations by UWB radar. It involves a gradient-based algorithm to optimize oscillation frequency and amplitude for maximum disruption while maintaining physiological plausibility.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Anti-Sensing as a privacy protection mechanism
	2. Development of an optimization algorithm for perturbation parameters
	3. Empirical validation of the effectiveness of the proposed solution through simulations and experiments.

**Result:** Simulations and real-world experiments show that Anti-Sensing significantly degrades the accuracy of heart rate sensing models relying on UWB radar data.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the approach may vary based on specific radar technologies and environmental conditions that affect radar sensing.

**Conclusion:** Anti-Sensing offers a practical solution for preserving privacy against unauthorized radar-based sensing, demonstrating that disruptive perturbations can effectively shield sensitive physiological information.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar technology have enabled contactless, non-line-of-sight vital sign monitoring, making it a valuable tool for healthcare. However, UWB radar's ability to capture sensitive physiological data, even through walls, raises significant privacy concerns, particularly in human-robot interactions and autonomous systems that rely on radar for sensing human presence and physiological functions. In this paper, we present Anti-Sensing, a novel defense mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized radar-based sensing. Our approach introduces physically realizable perturbations, such as oscillatory motion from wearable devices, to disrupt radar sensing by mimicking natural cardiac motion, thereby misleading heart rate (HR) estimations. We develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the frequency and spatial amplitude of these oscillations for maximal disruption while ensuring physiological plausibility. Through both simulations and real-world experiments with radar data and neural network-based HR sensing models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Anti-Sensing in significantly degrading model accuracy, offering a practical solution for privacy preservation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of Extended Reality and Machine Learning can significantly enhance the methodology of teaching geometry, improving engagement and learning outcomes.

**Abstract:** Technology has helped to innovate in the teaching-learning process. Today's students are more demanding actors when it comes to the environment, they have at their disposal to learn, experiment and develop critical thinking. The area of mathematics has successively suffered from students' learning difficulties, whether due to lack of motivation, low abstraction ability, or lack of new tools for teachers to bring innovation into the classroom and outside it. While it is true that digitalization has entered schools, it often follows a process of digital replication of approaches and materials that were previously only available on physical media. This work focuses on the use of Extended Realities for teaching mathematics, and very particularly in the teaching of geometry, with a proposition of a conceptual model that combines the use of Extended Reality and Machine Learning. The proposed model was subject to prototyping, which is presented as a form of laboratory validation as a contribution to innovate the way in which the geometry teaching-learning process is developed, as well as through the ability to obtain useful insights for teachers and students throughout the process.

### [9] [Sliding Speed Influences Electrovibration-Induced Finger Friction Dynamics on Touchscreens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11162)

*Jagan K Balasubramanian, Daan M Pool, Yasemin Vardar*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** Electrovibration, Touchscreens, Haptic feedback, Finger friction, Skin mechanics

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how variations in sliding speed and applied force impact electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens. It reveals a model to predict friction response based on these exploration conditions, enhancing haptic feedback technology.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Electrovibration technology aims to improve user experience on touchscreen devices by providing tactile feedback, but variations in user interaction complicate the rendering of realistic textures.

**Method:** Ten participants slid their fingers on an electrovibration-enabled touchscreen at varying speeds and forces, measuring contact forces and skin accelerations. A first-order system model was used for finger-touchscreen friction, and a mass-spring-damper model was used for skin mechanics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a model for finger friction on touchscreens considering sliding speed variations.
	2. Quantitative analysis of the effects of speed and force on finger mechanics during touchscreen interactions.
	3. Insights into the influence of skin mechanics on electrovibration technology.

**Result:** The study found that sliding speed significantly influenced the friction response, modifying parameters like cutoff frequency, mass, and stiffness of the finger. A 1 mm/s increase in speed resulted in specific quantified increases in these parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** A practical model for electrovibration-induced finger friction was developed, facilitating consistent haptic feedback and addressing challenges in texture rendering on touchscreens.

**Abstract:** Electrovibration technology can render tactile textures on capacitive touchscreens by modulating friction between the finger and the screen through electrostatic attraction force generated by applying an alternating voltage signal to the screen. This signal should be carefully calibrated for realistic and robust texture rendering. However, this process is challenging due to variations in sliding speed, applied force, and individual skin mechanics, which affect friction in complex and unpredictable ways. Here, we investigate how exploration conditions affect electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens and the role of skin mechanics in this process. Ten participants slid their index fingers across an electrovibration-enabled touchscreen at five sliding speeds ($20\sim100$ mm/s) and applied force levels ($0.2\sim0.6$ N) while we measured contact forces and skin accelerations. The touchscreen was excited with amplitude-modulated voltage signals across frequencies relevant to touch. We modeled the finger-touchscreen friction response as a first-order system and the skin mechanics as a mass-spring-damper system. Our results showed that the sliding speed influenced the cutoff frequency of the friction response as well as the moving mass and stiffness of the finger for the tested exploration ranges. Specifically, for every 1 mm/s increase in speed, the cutoff frequency, the finger moving mass, and stiffness increased by $13.8$ Hz, $3.23\times 10^{-5}$ kg, and $4.04$ N/m, respectively. Further correlation analysis revealed that finger stiffness affected the cutoff frequency more than the moving mass. Finally, we developed a practical model for electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens that accounts for sliding speed variations, paving the way for delivering consistent haptic feedback through electrovibration.

**Motivation:** To explore the psychological impact of co-writing with AI on self-perception and locus of control.

**Method:** An empirical study was conducted with 462 participants to assess the relationship between employment status, reliance on AI, and locus of control.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies the psychological effects of AI co-writing on locus of control.
	2. Finds a correlation between employment status and reliance on AI.
	3. Highlights the implications of AI on personal agency and identity.

**Result:** Employed participants showed greater reliance on AI and a movement towards an internal locus of control, whereas unemployed participants experienced a decline in personal agency.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the sample population and may not generalize across different demographics or cultural contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that AI has a significant impact on personal agency and identity, particularly influenced by employment status.

**Abstract:** As AI tools increasingly shape how we write, they may also quietly reshape how we perceive ourselves. This paper explores the psychological impact of co-writing with AI on people's locus of control. Through an empirical study with 462 participants, we found that employment status plays a critical role in shaping users' reliance on AI and their locus of control. Current results demonstrated that employed participants displayed higher reliance on AI and a shift toward internal control, while unemployed users tended to experience a reduction in personal agency. Through quantitative results and qualitative observations, this study opens a broader conversation about AI's role in shaping personal agency and identity.

**Keywords:** user profiling, multi-session interactions, small language models, smart home environments, privacy-respecting AI

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** A dataset and benchmark for improving small language models in smart home environments by focusing on user profiling from multi-session interactions is introduced.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance small language models for user profiling in smart home environments while ensuring user privacy and efficient on-device processing.

**Method:** The paper introduces a dataset with structured user profiles based on routines, allowing LLMs to generate simulated dialogues for benchmarking profile reconstruction tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel dataset for user profiling from natural language interactions in smart homes
	2. Benchmarking of state-of-the-art compact language models against large foundation models
	3. Assessment of the performance gap in profile reconstruction tasks

**Result:** Small language models can reconstruct user profiles but underperform compared to large foundation models, highlighting the challenge of balancing model size and performance with on-device processing benefits.

**Limitations:** The small models, while effective, still lack the accuracy of large models in understanding user behavior.

**Conclusion:** The dataset offers a crucial step toward developing intelligent AI systems that respect user privacy and adapt on user-owned devices.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to assess and improve small language models deployable on edge devices, with a focus on user profiling from multi-session natural language interactions in smart home environments. At the core of the dataset are structured user profiles, each defined by a set of routines - context-triggered, repeatable patterns of behavior that govern how users interact with their home systems. Using these profiles as input, a large language model (LLM) generates corresponding interaction sessions that simulate realistic, diverse, and context-aware dialogues between users and their devices.   The primary task supported by this dataset is profile reconstruction: inferring user routines and preferences solely from interactions history. To assess how well current models can perform this task under realistic conditions, we benchmarked several state-of-the-art compact language models and compared their performance against large foundation models. Our results show that while small models demonstrate some capability in reconstructing profiles, they still fall significantly short of large models in accurately capturing user behavior. This performance gap poses a major challenge - particularly because on-device processing offers critical advantages, such as preserving user privacy, minimizing latency, and enabling personalized experiences without reliance on the cloud. By providing a realistic, structured testbed for developing and evaluating behavioral modeling under these constraints, our dataset represents a key step toward enabling intelligent, privacy-respecting AI systems that learn and adapt directly on user-owned devices.

**Limitations:** The paper's framework may need further empirical validation across diverse applications and contexts.

**Conclusion:** The HCAI-MF framework is positioned as a vital tool for advancing the practice of Human-Centered AI and addressing the challenges faced in the field.

**Abstract:** Human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) is a design philosophy that prioritizes humans in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, aiming to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its negative impacts. Despite its growing prominence in literature, the lack of methodological guidance for its implementation poses challenges to HCAI practice. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive HCAI methodological framework (HCAI-MF) comprising five key components: HCAI requirement hierarchy, approach and method taxonomy, process, interdisciplinary collaboration approach, and multi-level design paradigms. A case study demonstrates HCAI-MF's practical implications, while the paper also analyzes implementation challenges. Actionable recommendations and a "three-layer" HCAI implementation strategy are provided to address these challenges and guide future evolution of HCAI-MF. HCAI-MF is presented as a systematic and executable methodology capable of overcoming current gaps, enabling effective design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, and advancing HCAI practice.

This paper explores Augmented Object Intelligence (AOI) in the context of XR, an interaction paradigm that aims to blur the lines between digital and physical by equipping real-world objects with the ability to interact as if they were digital, where every object has the potential to serve as a portal to digital functionalities. Our approach utilizes real-time object segmentation and classification, combined with the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to facilitate these interactions without the need for object pre-registration. We implement the AOI concept in the form of XR-Objects, an open-source prototype system that provides a platform for users to engage with their physical environment in contextually relevant ways using object-based context menus. This system enables analog objects to not only convey information but also to initiate digital actions, such as querying for details or executing tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we define the AOI concept and detail its advantages over traditional AI assistants, (2) detail the XR-Objects system's open-source design and implementation, and (3) show its versatility through various use cases and a user study.

**Motivation:** To enhance the precision and efficiency of radiotherapy planning, which is traditionally complex and time-intensive, by using AI-driven approaches.

**Method:** The AIRTP system automates critical steps in radiotherapy planning, including organ-at-risk contouring, beam setup, and plan optimization, adhering to clinical guidelines and utilizing existing RT planning software.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The AIRTP system not only improves the efficiency of radiotherapy planning but is also committed to public research with the release of a large dataset for further studies.

**Abstract:** Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances with artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision and efficiency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Varian Eclipse. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations is proposed. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. To our best knowledge, this dataset features more than 10 times number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public dataset.

**TL;DR:** Introducing a two-phase 'organize-then-vote' Quadratic Survey interface that reduces cognitive load and improves decision-making accuracy compared to traditional methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Quadratic Surveys elicit more accurate preferences but face adoption challenges due to cognitive load; this research aims to mitigate those challenges through thoughtful interface design.

**Method:** A 2x2 between-subject in-lab study compared a two-phase interface with a traditional text interface across Quadratic Surveys with varying option lengths (6 vs. 24).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a two-phase 'organize-then-vote' Quadratic Survey interface
	2. Empirical validation showing reduced cognitive load and improved engagement in decision-making
	3. Insights into the impact of human-centered design on collective decision-making tools

**Result:** Participants using the two-phase interface spent more time on each option and demonstrated shorter voting edit distances, indicating deeper engagement.

**Limitations:** Focus on a specific context (public resource allotment) may limit generalizability; further testing in diverse scenarios needed.

**Conclusion:** The new interface enhances preference elicitation by reducing cognitive overload, promoting more comprehensive preference construction.

**Abstract:** Quadratic Surveys (QSs) elicit more accurate preferences than traditional methods like Likert-scale surveys. However, the cognitive load associated with QSs has hindered their adoption in digital surveys for collective decision-making. We introduce a two-phase "organize-then-vote" QS to reduce cognitive load. As interface design significantly impacts survey results and accuracy, our design scaffolds survey takers' decision-making while managing the cognitive load imposed by QS. In a 2x2 between-subject in-lab study on public resource allotment, we compared our interface with a traditional text interface across a QS with 6 (short) and 24 (long) options. Two-phase interface participants spent more time per option and exhibited shorter voting edit distances. We qualitatively observed shifts in cognitive effort from mechanical operations to constructing more comprehensive preferences. We conclude that this interface promoted deeper engagement, potentially reducing satisficing behaviors caused by cognitive overload in longer QSs. This research clarifies how human-centered design improves preference elicitation tools for collective decision-making.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of producing distinct EMG patterns for reliable movement classification in myoelectric prostheses.

**Method:** A 10-session study with 12 participants comparing performance outcomes after using the Reviewer versus conventional training visualization methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Reviewer as a 3D visual feedback tool for prosthesis control
	2. Demonstration of improved training outcomes in myoelectric control
	3. Reduction of reliance on heuristic adjustments through real-time insights into EMG patterns

**Result:** Participants using the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved efficiency in tasks compared to those using standard methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Reviewer enhances PR control in novice operators via structured feedback during training, reducing the need for extensive heuristic recalibrations.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.

**Motivation:** To understand the unintended consequences of LLM-based GUI agents in web browsing scenarios and improve their design.

**Method:** Social media analysis (221 posts) and semi-structured interviews (14 participants).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Characterization of three unintended consequences of LLM-based GUI agents.
	2. Insights from social media and interviews to inform design improvements.

**Result:** Identified deficiencies in agents' comprehension, task planning, reliability, and error handling, leading to user frustration, privacy risks, and undermined trust.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Mitigation strategies include technical adjustments and manual oversight, stressing the importance of user-focused design in future LLM-based GUI agents.

**Abstract:** The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents in web browsing scenarios present complex unintended consequences (UCs). This paper characterizes three UCs from three perspectives: phenomena, influence and mitigation, drawing on social media analysis (N=221 posts) and semi-structured interviews (N=14). Key phenomenon for UCs include agents' deficiencies in comprehending instructions and planning tasks, challenges in executing accurate GUI interactions and adapting to dynamic interfaces, the generation of unreliable or misaligned outputs, and shortcomings in error handling and feedback processing. These phenomena manifest as influences from unanticipated actions and user frustration, to privacy violations and security vulnerabilities, and further to eroded trust and wider ethical concerns. Our analysis also identifies user-initiated mitigation, such as technical adjustments and manual oversight, and provides implications for designing future LLM-based GUI agents that are robust, user-centric, and transparent, fostering a crucial balance between automation and human oversight.

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiencies in interpreting material heritage solely through observation and to provide visitors with immersive tools for understanding cultural dimensions.

**Method:** The article presents a conceptual model based on the use of virtual reality, specifically prototyped in the Portuguese Museum of Miranda do Douro.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a conceptual model for virtual reality application in heritage interpretation
	2. Prototyping of VR solutions in a specific museum setting
	3. Identification of the cultural relevance of VR in understanding heritage.

**Result:** The proposed VR solutions aim to bridge the gap between material heritage and its immaterial context, leading to a deeper visitor engagement with cultural heritage.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The use of VR in museums is positioned as a significant advancement for the interpretation of heritage and the engagement of visitors with cultural traditions.

**Abstract:** Material heritage typically has a whole set of associated immaterial heritage, which is essential to pass on to the visitor as a cultural mission of the destinations and those who manage them. In this sense, the interpretation of material heritage is a complex process that is not a fully efficient process with the mere observation of physical artifacts. In this context, it emerges as fundamental to provide visitors with a set of tools that allow them to correctly interpret the artifacts that come to fully understand the cultural dimension of the destinations and their heritage. Accordingly, the role of virtual reality can leverage the creation of innovative and immersive solutions that allow the visitor to understand and feel part of their own heritage and its ancestral component that defines the sociocultural roots of destinations and their civilizational traditions. This article, after dissecting and substantiating the role of virtual reality in the interpretation of heritage, presents a conceptual model, based on the use of virtual reality, which was, in part, prototyped in the scenario of the Portuguese Museum in the city of Miranda do Douro. This proposal is an ongoing contribution to the creation of innovative and immersive tools for the interpretation of heritage.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>

**Motivation:** To develop technology that comprehensively understands user preferences and habits beyond isolated contexts, addressing the limitations of current user models.

**Method:** The GUM architecture processes unstructured user observations, inferring confidence-weighted propositions about user knowledge and preferences through multimodal data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the General User Model (GUM) architecture
	2. Illustration of various applications across chat-based assistants and OS notifications
	3. Development of proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that execute user-oriented actions

**Result:** GUMs accurately infer user intentions and preferences, leading to the development of proactive assistants that can perform actions based on inferred context without explicit user requests.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GUMs offer a novel method for understanding unstructured context in user interactions, paving the way for advanced interactive systems that can anticipate user needs.

**Abstract:** Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model (GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g., device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that capture that user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive systems that anticipate user needs.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to self-reported measures and may not capture all dimensions of personal agency.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that AI tools may significantly influence users' perceptions of their own agency and identity, prompting further discussion on the societal implications of AI integration in writing.

**Abstract:** As AI tools increasingly shape how we write, they may also quietly reshape how we perceive ourselves. This paper explores the psychological impact of co-writing with AI on people's locus of control. Through an empirical study with 462 participants, we found that employment status plays a critical role in shaping users' reliance on AI and their locus of control. Current results demonstrated that employed participants displayed higher reliance on AI and a shift toward internal control, while unemployed users tended to experience a reduction in personal agency. Through quantitative results and qualitative observations, this study opens a broader conversation about AI's role in shaping personal agency and identity.

**TL;DR:** The study examines scoring biases in automatic scoring systems for English Language Learners (ELLs) in science assessments, finding that large training datasets mitigate bias.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate biases in automatic scoring systems towards English Language Learners (ELLs) and ensure fair assessment in educational contexts.

**Method:** The study fine-tuned BERT using four datasets with varying proportions of ELL and non-ELL responses and analyzed scoring accuracy through Friedman tests.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of scoring bias with ELLs in automatic systems
	2. Analysis impact of training data size on scoring fairness
	3. Quantitative measurements of Mean Score Gaps between ELLs and non-ELLs

**Result:** The analysis showed no AI bias with larger training datasets, while smaller datasets raised concerns about disparities in scoring accuracy.

**Limitations:** Concerns about scoring disparities when training datasets are small, specifically when ELL responses are limited in number.

**Conclusion:** Scoring systems can be unbiased and effective for ELLs if trained on sufficiently large datasets; caution is warranted for smaller datasets to avoid scoring disparities.

**Abstract:** This study investigated potential scoring biases and disparities toward English Language Learners (ELLs) when using automatic scoring systems for middle school students' written responses to science assessments. We specifically focus on examining how unbalanced training data with ELLs contributes to scoring bias and disparities. We fine-tuned BERT with four datasets: responses from (1) ELLs, (2) non-ELLs, (3) a mixed dataset reflecting the real-world proportion of ELLs and non-ELLs (unbalanced), and (4) a balanced mixed dataset with equal representation of both groups. The study analyzed 21 assessment items: 10 items with about 30,000 ELL responses, five items with about 1,000 ELL responses, and six items with about 200 ELL responses. Scoring accuracy (Acc) was calculated and compared to identify bias using Friedman tests. We measured the Mean Score Gaps (MSGs) between ELLs and non-ELLs and then calculated the differences in MSGs generated through both the human and AI models to identify the scoring disparities. We found that no AI bias and distorted disparities between ELLs and non-ELLs were found when the training dataset was large enough (ELL = 30,000 and ELL = 1,000), but concerns could exist if the sample size is limited (ELL = 200).

**Abstract:** We present GeoGrid-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to understand geo-spatial data in the grid structure. Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.

**Motivation:** High computation costs and latency of large language models limit their deployment in clinical settings; small language models need adaptation for effective use in healthcare.

**Method:** The MediPhi framework utilizes pre-instruction tuning of experts on medical corpora, model merging, and alignment for clinical tasks. It introduces the CLUE+ benchmark and builds the MediFlow collection for training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MediPhi for adapting small language models in clinical settings
	2. Development of the CLUE+ benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of clinical NLP
	3. Creation of MediFlow, a synthetic dataset for medical NLP tasks

**Result:** Expert models showed significant improvements over base models on the CLUE+ benchmark without task-specific fine-tuning, outperforming GPT-4-0125 in various clinical tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The MediPhi framework effectively adapts SLMs for clinical use, enhancing performance on medical NLP tasks with the introduction of MediFlow and rigorous benchmarking.

**Abstract:** High computation costs and latency of large language models such as GPT-4 have limited their deployment in clinical settings. Small language models (SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of 3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline, MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5% on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by 14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization achieves further gains of 18.9% on average.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the trade-offs in traditional semantic feature norming methods while enhancing the depth of human conceptual knowledge representation.

**Method:** A dataset of human-generated feature norms is augmented with responses from LLMs, and the quality of norms is validated against human judgments to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the NOVA dataset that integrates LLM responses with human norms
	2. Demonstration of superior performance in predicting semantic similarity
	3. Validation of LLM usage in cognitive science research

**Result:** The NOVA dataset exhibits higher feature density and greater overlap among concepts compared to traditional human-only datasets and significantly improves predictions of semantic similarity judgments.

**Limitations:** The study relies on the quality of the LLM responses and human judgments for validation, which may introduce biases or inaccuracies.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the richness of human conceptual knowledge beyond previous datasets and the viability of using LLMs as tools for enhancing cognitive science research.

**Abstract:** Semantic feature norms have been foundational in the study of human conceptual knowledge, yet traditional methods face trade-offs between concept/feature coverage and verifiability of quality due to the labor-intensive nature of norming studies. Here, we introduce a novel approach that augments a dataset of human-generated feature norms with responses from large language models (LLMs) while verifying the quality of norms against reliable human judgments. We find that our AI-enhanced feature norm dataset, NOVA: Norms Optimized Via AI, shows much higher feature density and overlap among concepts while outperforming a comparable human-only norm dataset and word-embedding models in predicting people's semantic similarity judgments. Taken together, we demonstrate that human conceptual knowledge is richer than captured in previous norm datasets and show that, with proper validation, LLMs can serve as powerful tools for cognitive science research.

**Motivation:** To address the gap between the theoretical symbolic capabilities of transformer architectures and their practical learnability from unsupervised data, particularly in light of the advancements in large language models.

**Method:** The paper proposes tracr-injection, which distills RASP-written algorithms into a pre-trained language model, resulting in an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of tracr-injection method for distilling algorithms into language models
	2. Creation of an interpretable subspace in the model's residual stream
	3. Demonstration of improved out-of-distribution performance.

**Result:** The implementation of tracr-injection demonstrated improvements in out-of-distribution performance and allowed for decoding of variables from RASP algorithms into the model's framework.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support that a more symbolic mechanism is functioning in the model's inner workings, bridging the gap between RASP algorithms and practical applications in transformers.

**Abstract:** Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that the proposed method can improve out of distribution performance compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to run our experiments.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces IPOMP, an automated method for optimizing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) by using real-time model performance data for more accurate evaluations and sample selection.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Manual prompt engineering for LLMs is labor-intensive and ineffective, necessitating better methods for automated prompt optimization.

**Method:** IPOMP employs a two-stage approach involving semantic clustering and boundary analysis to select diverse samples, followed by iterative refinement using real-time model performance data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of IPOMP for prompt optimization in LLMs
	2. Demonstrated improvements in effectiveness and stability of prompts
	3. Application of real-time performance data for sample selection and refinement

**Result:** Evaluations on the BIG-bench dataset show that IPOMP improves prompt effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by at least 57% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with less than 1% computational overhead.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The results indicate that real-time performance-guided refinement can enhance existing coreset selection methods across various datasets.

**Abstract:** Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance requires well-crafted prompts, but manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and often ineffective. Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge but the majority of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection for effective Prompt Optimization using real-time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on the BIG-bench dataset show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by at least 57% compared with SOTA baselines, with minimal computational overhead below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance existing coreset selection methods.

**Abstract:** The rapid spread of online disinformation presents a global challenge, and machine learning has been widely explored as a potential solution. However, multilingual settings and low-resource languages are often neglected in this field. To address this gap, we conducted a shared task on multilingual claim retrieval at SemEval 2025, aimed at identifying fact-checked claims that match newly encountered claims expressed in social media posts across different languages. The task includes two subtracks: (1) a monolingual track, where social posts and claims are in the same language, and (2) a crosslingual track, where social posts and claims might be in different languages. A total of 179 participants registered for the task contributing to 52 test submissions. 23 out of 31 teams have submitted their system papers. In this paper, we report the best-performing systems as well as the most common and the most effective approaches across both subtracks. This shared task, along with its dataset and participating systems, provides valuable insights into multilingual claim retrieval and automated fact-checking, supporting future research in this field.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method for enhancing chain-of-thought reasoning through ranked voting among multiple ranked answers, improving self-consistency in reasoning processes.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of previous chain-of-thought reasoning methods that typically generate a single answer, which ignores other potential answers.

**Method:** The authors propose generating ranked answers in each reasoning process and applying three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda count voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introducing ranked voting methods for chain-of-thought reasoning.
	2. Validation across multiple datasets including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks.
	3. Demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

**Result:** The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches across six datasets, including multiple-choice and open-ended tasks, demonstrating improved reasoning performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Leveraging ranked answers and ranked voting significantly enhances the reliability of self-consistency in reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Majority voting is considered an effective method to enhance chain-of-thought reasoning, as it selects the answer with the highest "self-consistency" among different reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2023). However, previous chain-of-thought reasoning methods typically generate only a single answer in each trial, thereby ignoring the possibility of other potential answers. As a result, these alternative answers are often overlooked in subsequent voting processes. In this work, we propose to generate ranked answers in each reasoning process and conduct ranked voting among multiple ranked answers from different responses, thereby making the overall self-consistency more reliable. Specifically, we use three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda count voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting. We validate our methods on six datasets, including three multiple-choice and three open-ended question-answering tasks, using both advanced open-source and closed-source large language models. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the baselines, showcasing the potential of leveraging the information of ranked answers and using ranked voting to improve reasoning performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address persistent challenges in public understanding of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment due to ineffective communication.

**Method:** Mixed-methods evaluation framework focusing on linguistic quality, safety, trustworthiness, and communication accessibility across five general-purpose and three medical LLMs, utilizing quantitative and qualitative ratings and statistical analysis.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of general-purpose vs medical LLMs for cancer communication

**Result:** General-purpose LLMs had higher linguistic quality and affectiveness, while medical LLMs showed better communication accessibility but exhibited higher potential harm and bias.

**Limitations:** Focus on breast and cervical cancer may not generalize to other health topics.

**Conclusion:** There's a need for intentional design improvements in LLMs for health communication to ensure safety and effectiveness, particularly for cancer information.

**Abstract:** Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Choosing an appropriate base model and optimizing post-training steps is crucial for improving reward modeling performance in large language models.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and, at its core, reward modeling have become a crucial part of training powerful large language models (LLMs). One commonly overlooked factor in training high-quality reward models (RMs) is the effect of the base model, which is becoming more challenging to choose given the rapidly growing pool of LLMs. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of base model selection on reward modeling performance. Our results show that the performance can be improved by up to 14% compared to the most common (i.e., default) choice. Moreover, we showcase the strong statistical relation between some existing benchmarks and downstream performances. We also demonstrate that the results from a small set of benchmarks could be combined to boost the model selection ($+$18% on average in the top 5-10). Lastly, we illustrate the impact of different post-training steps on the final performance and explore using estimated data distributions to reduce performance prediction error.

**Result:** Preliminary experiments reveal significant variability in model performance across the datasets, highlighting AffilKG's potential to benchmark error propagation in extraction and validate KG extraction methods for social science research.

**Limitations:** The datasets may have limitations in representing all possible relationships in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** AffilKG enables critical advances in understanding the impact of extraction errors on graph-level analyses and validating knowledge graph extraction for real-world applications.

**Abstract:** When knowledge graphs (KGs) are automatically extracted from text, are they accurate enough for downstream analysis? Unfortunately, current annotated datasets can not be used to evaluate this question, since their KGs are highly disconnected, too small, or overly complex. To address this gap, we introduce AffilKG (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15427977), which is a collection of six datasets that are the first to pair complete book scans with large, labeled knowledge graphs. Each dataset features affiliation graphs, which are simple KGs that capture Member relationships between Person and Organization entities -- useful in studies of migration, community interactions, and other social phenomena. In addition, three datasets include expanded KGs with a wider variety of relation types. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate significant variability in model performance across datasets, underscoring AffilKG's ability to enable two critical advances: (1) benchmarking how extraction errors propagate to graph-level analyses (e.g., community structure), and (2) validating KG extraction methods for real-world social science research.

**Conclusion:** With proper validation, LLMs can effectively enhance cognitive science research by providing richer conceptual knowledge through AI-assisted norm datasets.

**Abstract:** Semantic feature norms have been foundational in the study of human conceptual knowledge, yet traditional methods face trade-offs between concept/feature coverage and verifiability of quality due to the labor-intensive nature of norming studies. Here, we introduce a novel approach that augments a dataset of human-generated feature norms with responses from large language models (LLMs) while verifying the quality of norms against reliable human judgments. We find that our AI-enhanced feature norm dataset, NOVA: Norms Optimized Via AI, shows much higher feature density and overlap among concepts while outperforming a comparable human-only norm dataset and word-embedding models in predicting people's semantic similarity judgments. Taken together, we demonstrate that human conceptual knowledge is richer than captured in previous norm datasets and show that, with proper validation, LLMs can serve as powerful tools for cognitive science research.

**Motivation:** To address the computational overhead and latency introduced by explicit reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs) for simple problems.

**Method:** A multi-stage reinforcement learning framework called AutoThink is developed to optimize reasoning policies, using prompt modifications to trigger thinking modes based on problem complexity.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AutoThink framework for adaptive reasoning in LRMs
	2. Demonstration of enhanced accuracy-efficiency trade-offs
	3. Integration capabilities with existing R1-style models

**Result:** AutoThink achieves a 6.4% improvement in accuracy and reduces token usage by 52% on certain benchmarks, outperforming other prompting and RL-based pruning methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AutoThink establishes a scalable and adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs, making it easier to integrate with existing models for improved efficiency.

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) are proficient at generating explicit, step-by-step reasoning sequences before producing final answers. However, such detailed reasoning can introduce substantial computational overhead and latency, particularly for simple problems. To address this over-thinking problem, we explore how to equip LRMs with adaptive thinking capabilities: enabling them to dynamically decide whether or not to engage in explicit reasoning based on problem complexity. Building on R1-style distilled models, we observe that inserting a simple ellipsis ("...") into the prompt can stochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a latent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we propose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that progressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping. AutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while defaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five mainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and RL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style model, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants. Notably, AutoThink improves relative accuracy by 6.4 percent while reducing token usage by 52 percent on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, establishing a scalable and adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacies of traditional unimodal systems in detecting events on social media due to the rapid and multimodal nature of data.

**Method:** The authors use several models, including ModernBERT, ConvNeXt-V2, and advanced generative models like GPT-4o and LLaVA, assessing their performance in event detection on social media.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of multimodal event detection in social media
	2. Comparison between generative and supervised models
	3. Insight into social media data characteristics affecting model performance

**Result:** The study finds that multimodal approaches surpass unimodal ones in performance, but generative models like GPT-4o lag behind supervised methods in precision and event class generation.

**Limitations:** Generative models have limitations in precision and event class generation compared to supervised methods.

**Conclusion:** Multimodal methods are more effective than unimodal ones, while generative models struggle with precision and correct event classification compared to instruction-tuned models; however, they handle certain social media vernacular successfully.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the challenges of detecting events on social media, where traditional unimodal systems struggle due to the rapid and multimodal nature of data dissemination. We employ a range of models, including unimodal ModernBERT and ConvNeXt-V2, multimodal fusion techniques, and advanced generative models like GPT-4o, and LLaVA. Additionally, we also study the effect of providing multimodal generative models (such as GPT-4o) with a single modality to assess their efficacy. Our results indicate that while multimodal approaches notably outperform unimodal counterparts, generative approaches despite having a large number of parameters, lag behind supervised methods in precision. Furthermore, we also found that they lag behind instruction-tuned models because of their inability to generate event classes correctly. During our error analysis, we discovered that common social media issues such as leet speak, text elongation, etc. are effectively handled by generative approaches but are hard to tackle using supervised approaches.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to understand the challenges that MLLMs face when interpreting time from analog clocks, which may arise from inadequate training data.

**Method:** The authors test GPT-4.1 on various analog clocks to assess its ability to read time and evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning the model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of MLLMs' performance on analog clock reading
	2. Assessment of the impact of fine-tuning on model accuracy
	3. Analysis of training set limitations affecting model generalization

**Result:** The findings indicate that while MLLMs are improving in clock reading, their ability to accurately tell time may still be reliant on training patterns rather than genuine understanding.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on one model (GPT-4.1) and may not generalize across all MLLMs or other types of tasks.

**Conclusion:** The work reveals that the progress made by MLLMs in reading analog clocks is limited and often superficial, raising questions about their true learning capabilities.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models which can answer complex questions on an image struggle to tell the time on analog clocks. This is probably due to the lack of images with clocks at different times in their training set. In this work we explore this issue with one of the latest MLLMs: GPT-4.1 to understand why MLLMs fail to tell the time and whether fine-tuning can solve the problem. The results show how models are making progress in reading the time on analog clocks. But have they really learned to do it, or have they only learned patterns in their training datasets? In this work we put the models to the test with different clocks to illustrate the limitations of MLLMs to abstract and generalize.

**Method:** The proposed SIAR approach uses LLMs to induce relevant inferential rules for query augmentation, while Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$) reassesses the relevance of retrieved rules based on their instantiation to align with query facts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval (SIAR) for enhanced rule retrieval.
	2. Development of Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$) to reassess rule relevance to queries.
	3. Extensive experimental validation across multiple settings showcasing improved reasoning performance.

**Result:** Experiments show that SIAR and R$^3$ significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness and reasoning performance across various settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The methodologies proposed provide a systematic approach to improve rule retrieval, demonstrating their effectiveness and versatility in practical applications.

**Abstract:** This paper systematically addresses the challenges of rule retrieval, a crucial yet underexplored area. Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval (SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Cochain provides a cost-effective solution to improve collaboration in business workflows, maintaining efficiency by leveraging an integrated approach.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in executing complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought effectively enhances reasoning capabilities by unlocking the potential of large models, while multi-agent systems provide more comprehensive solutions by integrating collective intelligence of multiple agents. However, both approaches face significant limitations. Single-agent with chain-of-thought, due to the inherent complexity of designing cross-domain prompts, faces collaboration challenges. Meanwhile, multi-agent systems consume substantial tokens and inevitably dilute the primary problem, which is particularly problematic in business workflow tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Cochain, a collaboration prompting framework that effectively solves business workflow collaboration problem by combining knowledge and prompts at a reduced cost. Specifically, we construct an integrated knowledge graph that incorporates knowledge from multiple stages. Furthermore, by maintaining and retrieving a prompts tree, we can obtain prompt information relevant to other stages of the business workflow. We perform extensive evaluations of Cochain across multiple datasets, demonstrating that Cochain outperforms all baselines in both prompt engineering and multi-agent LLMs. Additionally, expert evaluation results indicate that the use of a small model in combination with Cochain outperforms GPT-4.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of OmniThought and its unique annotations significantly contribute to advancing LRM development for complex reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** The emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs) has transformed Natural Language Processing by excelling in complex tasks such as mathematical problem-solving and code generation. These models leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, enabling them to emulate human-like reasoning strategies. However, the advancement of LRMs is hindered by the lack of comprehensive CoT datasets. Current resources often fail to provide extensive reasoning problems with coherent CoT processes distilled from multiple teacher models and do not account for multifaceted properties describing the internal characteristics of CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniThought, a large-scale dataset featuring 2 million CoT processes generated and validated by two powerful LRMs as teacher models. Each CoT process in OmniThought is annotated with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. We further establish a self-reliant pipeline to curate this dataset. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5 models of various sizes demonstrate the positive impact of our proposed scores on LRM training effectiveness. Based on the proposed OmniThought dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing LRMs, specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output length and difficulty level. Our contributions significantly enhance the development and training of LRMs for solving complex tasks.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, KV Cache, quantization, computational resources, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method to improve quantization accuracy in large language models (LLMs) by identifying and excluding unusual tokens from quantization, enhancing memory efficiency and throughput.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, and while KV Cache can reduce recomputation, it increases memory overhead. Effective quantization can help balance these demands.

**Method:** The authors propose a method to identify outlier tokens during the decoding process that do not conform to the typical distribution of Keys and Values. These tokens are excluded from quantization.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a method to identify outlier tokens during quantization
	2. Demonstration of significant accuracy improvements with a 2-bit quantization
	3. Achieved a balance of reduced memory usage and increased throughput in LLM deployment

**Result:** The proposed method results in significant improvements in accuracy under 2-bit quantization, achieving a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3 times increase in throughput.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Excluding outlier tokens from quantization provides a promising enhancement to the deployment efficiency of LLMs without compromising accuracy.

**Abstract:** The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) come at the cost of substantial computational resources during deployment. While KV Cache can significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern, which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier tokens, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit quantization and can deliver a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3 times increase in throughput.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the limitations of zero-shot generalization in large language models due to the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations.

**Method:** A modular framework is proposed that uses task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. General knowledge is subtracted to create residual modules focused on task-relevant information, and Arrow routing dynamically combines modules for new inputs.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** The proposed approach shows consistent performance improvements in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings on various benchmarks compared to standard baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GenKnowSub demonstrates better generalization in weaker LLMs, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing task-specific performance while maintaining general knowledge.

**Abstract:** Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm \citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/saharsamr/Modular-LLM.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** As Large Language Models increasingly incorporate multilingual capabilities, there is a need for effective methods to transfer these capabilities into target language-specific models without losing expressiveness.

**Method:** SALT recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models and constructs unique regression lines based on vocabulary overlap to handle non-overlapping tokens in embedding space.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SALT for cross-lingual transfer of embeddings
	2. Unique regression line construction based on vocabulary overlap
	3. Demonstrated significant improvements in performance and adaptability over existing methods

**Result:** SALT significantly outperforms existing transfer methods, achieving lower loss and faster convergence during language adaptation, especially in cross-lingual understanding setups.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed SALT technique enhances the functionality of contemporary LLMs and demonstrates impressive performance, suggesting a strong path forward for multilingual model development.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly incorporate multilingual capabilities, fueling the demand to transfer them into target language-specific models. However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary, may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs. SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods. Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality of contemporary LLMs by conducting experiments with varying architectures.

**Result:** Provides a detailed evaluation of approaches and performance benchmarks for multi-speaker ASR, highlighting the trade-offs between different architectural models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions for enhancing multi-speaker ASR systems.

**Abstract:** Monaural multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to data scarcity and the intrinsic difficulty of recognizing and attributing words to individual speakers, particularly in overlapping speech. Recent advances have driven the shift from cascade systems to end-to-end (E2E) architectures, which reduce error propagation and better exploit the synergy between speech content and speaker identity. Despite rapid progress in E2E multi-speaker ASR, the field lacks a comprehensive review of recent developments. This survey provides a systematic taxonomy of E2E neural approaches for multi-speaker ASR, highlighting recent advances and comparative analysis. Specifically, we analyze: (1) architectural paradigms (SIMO vs.~SISO) for pre-segmented audio, analyzing their distinct characteristics and trade-offs; (2) recent architectural and algorithmic improvements based on these two paradigms; (3) extensions to long-form speech, including segmentation strategy and speaker-consistent hypothesis stitching. Further, we (4) evaluate and compare methods across standard benchmarks. We conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards building robust and scalable multi-speaker ASR.

**Motivation:** Understanding in-context learning (ICL) is crucial for advancing language models and informing model developers and AI security practitioners on potential improvements and guidelines.

**Method:** The study employs a novel method and a suite of tasks to investigate ICL using the Pythia scaling suite and interim checkpoints with varying amounts of training data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a systematic investigation of ICL using the Pythia scaling suite.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work advances the understanding of ICL, highlighting its complexity and offering practical insights for model developers and AI security practitioners.

**Abstract:** Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more informed guidelines.

**Abstract:** The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative "Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty. We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\% on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for generating high-quality conversational data at scale.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of LLMs' ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' proficiency in handling ontologies -- formal, symbolic representations of domain knowledge through concepts, relationships, and instances. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 58,981 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing proficiency in understanding ontological knowledge but substantial weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LLMs' capability to process symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.

**Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction, Instruction-following, Language Model Alignment, BLEU, Reinforcement Learning

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces BLEUBERI, a method that uses BLEU as a reward function for aligning LLMs with human preferences in instruction-following tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to traditional reward models.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore simpler alternatives to costly reward models for aligning LLMs with human preferences, leveraging the availability of high-quality synthetic datasets.

**Method:** The paper develops BLEUBERI, which uses BLEU as a reward function in a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, targeting challenging instructions identified through the model's performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BLEUBERI, a new alignment method using BLEU as a reward metric
	2. Demonstration that BLEU can match reward models in terms of human preference alignment
	3. Release of code and data for further research on effective LLM alignment techniques.

**Result:** BLEUBERI-trained models perform competitively with those trained using reward models across several benchmarks, maintaining high alignment with human preferences and generating factually grounded outputs.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on instruction-following tasks and may not generalize well to other LLM applications.

**Conclusion:** BLEUBERI shows that string-matching metrics can serve as effective and inexpensive substitutes for reward models in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences, especially when quality reference outputs are available.

**Abstract:** Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet effective proxies for reward models during alignment. We release our code and data at https://github.com/lilakk/BLEUBERI.

**Motivation:** The complexity of drafting patent claims creates access barriers for small enterprises, necessitating evaluation tools for automated systems.

**Method:** Patent-CE benchmark is introduced with expert-annotated evaluations on features like completeness, clarity, consistency, linkage, and quality. PatClaimEval is designed to assess claims across these dimensions.

**Key Contributions:**

**Conclusion:** The study establishes a foundation for improving evaluations in automated patent claim generation.

**Abstract:** Patent claims define the scope of protection and establish the legal boundaries of an invention. Drafting these claims is a complex and time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To solve these challenges, researchers have investigated the use of large language models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims. Our experiments demonstrate that PatClaimEval achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations across all assessment criteria among all tested metrics. This research provides the groundwork for more accurate evaluations of automated patent claim generation systems.

**Keywords:** content moderation, user satisfaction, ethical alignment, LLM, profanity moderation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction in LLMs, particularly how users react to ethical refusals versus technical refusals.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the underexplored relationship between content moderation practices in LLMs and user satisfaction, especially in cases where models refuse to answer prompts due to ethical considerations.

**Method:** The study analyzes nearly 50,000 model comparisons from Chatbot Arena, utilizing a fine-tuned RoBERTa-based refusal classifier to differentiate between ethical and technical refusals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a novel refusal classifier for analyzing user preferences in LLM responses.
	2. Provides empirical evidence of the refusal penalty related to ethical versus technical refusals.
	3. Highlights the importance of contextual sensitivity in user evaluations of LLM refusals.

**Result:** The analysis shows that ethical refusals lead to significantly lower win rates compared to technical refusals and standard responses, highlighting user dissatisfaction with ethical refusals, except when prompts are sensitive or refusals are contextually well-phrased.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to data from Chatbot Arena, which may not represent the broader user base and context. Additionally, it focuses primarily on refusal types without exploring other moderation strategies.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the necessity for adaptive moderation strategies in LLM design that align safety behaviors with user expectations, especially in sensitive contexts.

**Abstract:** LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. In particular, little is known about how users respond when models refuse to answer a prompt-one of the primary mechanisms used to enforce ethical boundaries in LLMs. We address this gap by analyzing nearly 50,000 model comparisons from Chatbot Arena, a platform where users indicate their preferred LLM response in pairwise matchups, providing a large-scale setting for studying real-world user preferences. Using a novel RoBERTa-based refusal classifier fine-tuned on a hand-labeled dataset, we distinguish between refusals due to ethical concerns and technical limitations. Our results reveal a substantial refusal penalty: ethical refusals yield significantly lower win rates than both technical refusals and standard responses, indicating that users are especially dissatisfied when models decline a task for ethical reasons. However, this penalty is not uniform. Refusals receive more favorable evaluations when the underlying prompt is highly sensitive (e.g., involving illegal content), and when the refusal is phrased in a detailed and contextually aligned manner. These findings underscore a core tension in LLM design: safety-aligned behaviors may conflict with user expectations, calling for more adaptive moderation strategies that account for context and presentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether longer reasoning chains improve factual accuracy in LLMs beyond just mathematical reasoning.

**Method:** The authors distill reasoning traces from advanced LLMs, fine-tune various models, and integrate factual information from knowledge graphs, conducting a comprehensive experimental evaluation over multiple datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of reasoning traces from advanced LLMs
	2. Integration of knowledge graph information into reasoning processes
	3. Empirical evidence on the impact of compute and token budgets on accuracy

**Result:** Smaller reasoning models show improved factual accuracy over original instruction-tuned models and using additional compute and token budgets leads to a consistent 2-8% increase in accuracy.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support the idea that more computational resources and longer reasoning processes can enhance the performance and accuracy of LLMs in open-domain QA scenarios.

**Abstract:** Recent studies on large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities have demonstrated promising improvements in model performance by leveraging a lengthy thinking process and additional computational resources during inference, primarily in tasks involving mathematical reasoning (Muennighoff et al., 2025). However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently enhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this work, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain question-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from advanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then fine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants to larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we introduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into our reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches and six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six datasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168 experimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that, within a single run, smaller reasoning models achieve noticeable improvements in factual accuracy compared to their original instruction-tuned counterparts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that adding test-time compute and token budgets factual accuracy consistently improves by 2-8%, further confirming the effectiveness of test-time scaling for enhancing performance and consequently improving reasoning accuracy in open-domain QA tasks. We release all the experimental artifacts for further research.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes SoLoPO, a framework aimed at improving long-context utilization in LLMs by optimizing short-context preference and aligning rewards to enhance model performance in extended contexts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges LLMs face in utilizing long-context information due to issues like data quality and inefficiencies in training and optimization objectives.

**Method:** The proposed SoLoPO framework decouples long-context preference optimization into short-context preference optimization and short-to-long reward alignment, leveraging theoretical and empirical evidence for its effectiveness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SoLoPO framework for long-context optimization in LLMs.
	2. Decoupling of long-context preference optimization into two components: short-context preference optimization and SoLo-RA.
	3. Demonstration of improved generalization abilities and efficiency across long-context benchmarks.

**Result:** SoLoPO shows enhancements in length and domain generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, alongside improvements in computational and memory efficiency compared to existing algorithms.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SoLoPO framework significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize long-context information by improving preference optimization and reward alignment, yielding better performance without compromising efficiency.

**Abstract:** Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the expressiveness of NoPE-transformers without positional encodings and map their capabilities to algebraic concepts, challenging existing models.

**Method:** The authors analyze Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs) and characterize the languages they can express in terms of semi-algebraic sets and counting properties.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Characterization of languages expressible by NoPE-AHATs as semi-algebraic sets.
	2. Establishing the undecidability of analyzing NoPE-transformers.
	3. Identification of a counting language not expressible by average hard attention transformers.

**Result:** NoPE-AHATs can express languages related to nonnegative integer solutions of multivariate polynomial inequations, surpassing simpler models but failing to express basic counting properties like PARITY.

**Limitations:** The paper does not detail practical applications or implementations of NoPE-transformers in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The study characterizes the limitations and capabilities of NoPE-transformers in terms of expressiveness, showing undecidability in analyzing their classification abilities and presenting a comparison with classical complexity classes.

**Abstract:** Positional Encodings (PEs) seem to be indispensable for ensuring expressiveness of transformers; without them attention transformers reduce to a bag-of-word model. NoPE-transformers (i.e. with No PEs) with unique hard attention mechanisms were very recently shown to only be able to express regular languages, i.e., with limited counting ability. This paper shows that, with average hard attention mechanisms, NoPE-transformers are still surprisingly expressive: they can express counting languages corresponding to nonnegative integer solutions to multivariate polynomial equations (i.e. Diophantine equations), reasoning about which is well-known to be undecidable. In fact, we provide a precise characterization of languages expressible by Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs): they correspond precisely to what we call \emph{semi-algebraic sets}, i.e., finite unions of sets of nonnegative integer solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial inequations. We obtain several interesting consequences of our characterization. Firstly, NoPE-transformers can express counting properties that are far more complex than established models like simplified counter machines and Petri nets, but cannot express a very simple counting property of PARITY. Secondly, the problem of analyzing NoPE-transformers is undecidable, e.g., whether a given NoPE transformer classifies all input strings in one class. To complement our results, we exhibit a counting language that is not expressible by average hard attention transformers even with arbitrary PEs but is expressible in the circuit complexity class TC$^0$, answering an open problem.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a method called History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO) that aims to enhance the conciseness of responses from large language models (LLMs) by utilizing historical data from past encounters, optimizing both length and correctness during generation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the reasoning abilities of large language models while minimizing verbosity and reducing inference costs through better use of historical performance data.

**Method:** HAPO keeps track of a history state for each problem, employing a novel length reward function based on this history to incentivize discovering more concise yet correct solutions. It combines length and correctness rewards to optimize the generation process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO) for LLMs.
	2. Development of a length reward structure that incorporates historical performance.
	3. Demonstrated improvements in response conciseness and efficiency on math benchmarks.

**Result:** HAPO was used to train several models and showed effectiveness in producing concise reasoning, achieving length reductions of 33-59% with minimal accuracy drops of 2-5% across various math benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HAPO successfully induces more concise reasoning in LLMs without significantly compromising accuracy, demonstrating a promising approach to test-time scaling.

**Abstract:** While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models (LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of 33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

**Result:** Experiments show that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks, especially in complex scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The introduction of AutoRefine leads to improved search quality and effective evidence synthesis, thereby enhancing the overall reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of ERD by integrating temporal considerations within the learning process, optimizing both precision and speed.

**Abstract:** Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web aims to identify promptly users facing social and health issues. Users are analyzed post-by-post, and it is necessary to guarantee correct and quick answers, which is particularly challenging in critical scenarios. ERD involves optimizing classification precision and minimizing detection delay. Standard classification metrics may not suffice, resorting to specific metrics such as ERDE(theta) that explicitly consider precision and delay. The current research focuses on applying a multi-objective approach, prioritizing classification performance and establishing a separate criterion for decision time. In this work, we propose a completely different strategy, temporal fine-tuning, which allows tuning transformer-based models by explicitly incorporating time within the learning process. Our method allows us to analyze complete user post histories, tune models considering different contexts, and evaluate training performance using temporal metrics. We evaluated our proposal in the depression and eating disorders tasks for the Spanish language, achieving competitive results compared to the best models of MentalRiskES 2023. We found that temporal fine-tuning optimized decisions considering context and time progress. In this way, by properly taking advantage of the power of transformers, it is possible to address ERD by combining precision and speed as a single objective.

**Keywords:** Transformers, Morphological inflection, Phonological features, Language-agnostic probing, Subphonemic features

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study introduces a language-agnostic probing method to explore phonological feature encoding in transformers, revealing varying effectiveness in capturing local and long-distance dependencies across seven languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand why transformers struggle to generalize across languages and morphological rules in inflection tasks, particularly in relation to phonological phenomena.

**Method:** A language-agnostic probing method is introduced, focusing on phonological feature encoding in transformers trained on phonemes, assessed across seven morphologically diverse languages.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a language-agnostic probing method for phonological features
	2. Analysis of local vs long-distance phonological dependencies in transformers
	3. Guidance for empirical strategies in training morphological models

**Result:** Phonological features that are local, such as devoicing, are well-represented in phoneme embeddings, while long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better captured by the transformer's encoder.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to seven languages, which may not encompass the full range of morphological diversity.

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into empirical strategies for training morphological models, highlighting the importance of subphonemic feature acquisition.

**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in morphological inflection tasks, yet their ability to generalize across languages and morphological rules remains limited. One possible explanation for this behavior can be the degree to which these models are able to capture implicit phenomena at the phonological and subphonemic levels. We introduce a language-agnostic probing method to investigate phonological feature encoding in transformers trained directly on phonemes, and perform it across seven morphologically diverse languages. We show that phonological features which are local, such as final-obstruent devoicing in Turkish, are captured well in phoneme embeddings, whereas long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better represented in the transformer's encoder. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform empirical strategies for training morphological models, particularly regarding the role of subphonemic feature acquisition.

**Motivation:** The study addresses the limitations of existing large language models in supporting the complex demands of academic writing, which often requires more than just surface-level revisions.

**Method:** The authors introduce a dataset of 7,040 annotated research papers with 140,000 instruction-response pairs, and develop XtraGPT, a suite of open-source LLMs designed for academic paper revision.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a comprehensive dataset for academic paper revisions.

**Result:** XtraGPT shows significant performance improvements over same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary systems through extensive experiments.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that XtraGPT effectively aids in improving the quality of scientific drafts through iterative and context-aware revisions.

**Abstract:** Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows, their capabilities remain limited when it comes to supporting high-quality scientific writing. Most existing systems are designed for general-purpose scientific text generation and fail to meet the sophisticated demands of research communication beyond surface-level polishing, such as conceptual coherence across sections. Furthermore, academic writing is inherently iterative and revision-driven, a process not well supported by direct prompting-based paradigms. To address these scenarios, we propose a human-AI collaboration framework for academic paper revision. We first introduce a comprehensive dataset of 7,040 research papers from top-tier venues annotated with over 140,000 instruction-response pairs that reflect realistic, section-level scientific revisions. Building on the dataset, we develop XtraGPT, the first suite of open-source LLMs, designed to provide context-aware, instruction-guided writing assistance, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters. Extensive experiments validate that XtraGPT significantly outperforms same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary systems. Both automated preference assessments and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our models in improving scientific drafts.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes LegoSLM, a method that combines speech encoders and LLMs using ASR posterior matrices for improved performance in ASR and speech translation tasks.

**Read time:** 7 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the limitations of existing methods that combine speech encoders and LLMs, such as inflexibility and suboptimal performance.

**Method:** The proposed LegoSLM method uses the ASR posterior matrices to generate pseudo-audio embeddings from a speech encoder, which are then concatenated with text embeddings for LLM input.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LegoSLM paradigm for integrating speech encoders and LLMs
	2. Demonstration of effective performance improvements in ASR and speech translation tasks
	3. Modular architecture allows for zero-shot model switching and fine-tuning capabilities

**Result:** The LegoSLM method achieves a 49% word error rate reduction (WERR) over the USM-CTC baseline on 8 multi-lingual speech test sets and demonstrates modularity by allowing easy swapping of the speech encoder.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LegoSLM effectively bridges the gap between speech encoders and LLMs, enhancing ASR and speech translation tasks while offering flexibility in model configurations.

**Abstract:** Recently, large-scale pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been released, which show state-of-the-art performance on a range of spoken language processing tasks including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To effectively combine both models for better performance, continuous speech prompts, and ASR error correction have been adopted. However, these methods are prone to suboptimal performance or are inflexible. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, LegoSLM, that bridges speech encoders and LLMs using the ASR posterior matrices. The speech encoder is trained to generate Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary, which are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted sum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text embeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma models as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields good performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM with Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline on 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of settings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can be switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we propose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax temperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for comprehensive benchmarks to assess LLMs' abilities in following domain-specific guidelines due to conflicts with their commonsense knowledge and frequent updates of those guidelines.

**Method:** GuideBench evaluates LLMs on adherence to diverse rules, robustness to rule updates, and alignment with human preferences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark (GuideBench) for evaluating LLMs
	2. Focus on three critical evaluation aspects: adherence to rules, robustness to updates, and human alignment
	3. Experimental results highlighting areas for improvement in LLM guideline following capabilities.

**Result:** Experimental results show significant opportunities for improving LLMsâ performances in guideline adherence.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GuideBench can facilitate better evaluation and development of LLMs as it addresses critical aspects of their performance in domain-oriented settings.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as autonomous agents capable of following user instructions and making decisions in real-world applications. Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper, we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to follow domain-oriented guidelines.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the systematic rules of tajwid in the Quran and enhance the understanding of its phonetic processes through digital tools.

**Method:** Developed a Python module to manipulate the orthographic layer of tajwid from the Contemporary Quranic Orthography (CQO) while studying the Cairo Quran text.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a Python module for tajwid analysis
	2. Creation of a framework for comparing Quranic manuscripts
	3. Insights into the phonetic and prosodic rules of tajwid

**Result:** The research allows for precise analysis of the Quranic text and facilitates alignment and comparison of Quranic manuscripts, enriching the study of Arabic script.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The developed framework can serve as an effective tool for examining diacritical notation systems in Quranic manuscripts.

**Abstract:** Contemporary Quranic Orthography (CQO) relies on a precise system of phonetic notation that can be traced back to the early stages of Islam, when the Quran was mainly oral in nature and the first written renderings of it served as memory aids for this oral tradition. The early systems of diacritical marks created on top of the Quranic Consonantal Text (QCT) motivated the creation and further development of a fine-grained system of phonetic notation that represented tajwid-the rules of recitation. We explored the systematicity of the rules of tajwid, as they are encountered in the Cairo Quran, using a fully and accurately encoded digital edition of the Quranic text. For this purpose, we developed a python module that can remove or add the orthographic layer of tajwid from a Quranic text in CQO. The interesting characteristic of these two sets of rules is that they address the complete Quranic text of the Cairo Quran, so they can be used as precise witnesses to study its phonetic and prosodic processes. From a computational point of view, the text of the Cairo Quran can be used as a linchpin to align and compare Quranic manuscripts, due to its richness and completeness. This will let us create a very powerful framework to work with the Arabic script, not just within an isolated text, but automatically exploring a specific textual phenomenon in other connected manuscripts. Having all the texts mapped among each other can serve as a powerful tool to study the nature of the notation systems of diacritics added to the consonantal skeleton.

**TL;DR:** CARES is a benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, addressing existing gaps in harmful prompt assessments.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** With the increasing deployment of LLMs in healthcare, there is a need for specific benchmarks that examine their safety and robustness against adversarial prompts.

**Method:** CARES includes over 18,000 prompts categorized by medical safety principles, harm levels, and prompting styles, employing a three-way response evaluation protocol to assess model responses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the CARES benchmark for medical LLM safety evaluation.
	2. Development of a fine-grained Safety Score metric and a three-way response evaluation protocol.
	3. Proposal of a mitigation strategy using a lightweight classifier for detecting jailbreak attempts.

**Result:** Analysis shows many LLMs are still vulnerable to cleverly rephrased harmful prompts, with a high tendency to over-reject safe queries.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may require continuous updates as LLMs and adversarial techniques evolve.

**Conclusion:** CARES offers a framework for evaluating and improving the safety of LLMs in medical settings, incorporating strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical contexts, raising critical concerns about safety, alignment, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. While prior benchmarks assess model refusal capabilities for harmful prompts, they often lack clinical specificity, graded harmfulness levels, and coverage of jailbreak-style attacks. We introduce CARES (Clinical Adversarial Robustness and Evaluation of Safety), a benchmark for evaluating LLM safety in healthcare. CARES includes over 18,000 prompts spanning eight medical safety principles, four harm levels, and four prompting styles: direct, indirect, obfuscated, and role-play, to simulate both malicious and benign use cases. We propose a three-way response evaluation protocol (Accept, Caution, Refuse) and a fine-grained Safety Score metric to assess model behavior. Our analysis reveals that many state-of-the-art LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaks that subtly rephrase harmful prompts, while also over-refusing safe but atypically phrased queries. Finally, we propose a mitigation strategy using a lightweight classifier to detect jailbreak attempts and steer models toward safer behavior via reminder-based conditioning. CARES provides a rigorous framework for testing and improving medical LLM safety under adversarial and ambiguous conditions.

**Motivation:** To bridge the cultural gap between the Bahnaric and Vietnamese ethnic groups through better translation capabilities.

**Method:** A sequence-to-sequence model is trained using a pre-trained Vietnamese language model and enhanced with bilingual resources and data augmentation techniques.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a transfer learning model for Bahnaric-Vietnamese translation
	2. Utilization of a pre-trained Vietnamese language model
	3. Implementation of data augmentation techniques for resource improvement

**Result:** The model effectively handles the translation task despite limited resources, improving accuracy and fostering better understanding between the ethnic groups.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach successfully contributes to the preservation of languages and enhances cultural exchange by providing a viable translation solution.

**Abstract:** This work explores the journey towards achieving Bahnaric-Vietnamese translation for the sake of culturally bridging the two ethnic groups in Vietnam. However, translating from Bahnaric to Vietnamese also encounters some difficulties. The most prominent challenge is the lack of available original Bahnaric resources source language, including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue patterns and bilingual corpus, which hinders the data collection process for training. To address this, we leverage a transfer learning approach using sequence-to-sequence pre-training language model. First of all, we leverage a pre-trained Vietnamese language model to capture the characteristics of this language. Especially, to further serve the purpose of machine translation, we aim for a sequence-to-sequence model, not encoder-only like BERT or decoder-only like GPT. Taking advantage of significant similarity between the two languages, we continue training the model with the currently limited bilingual resources of Vietnamese-Bahnaric text to perform the transfer learning from language model to machine translation. Thus, this approach can help to handle the problem of imbalanced resources between two languages, while also optimizing the training and computational processes. Additionally, we also enhanced the datasets using data augmentation to generate additional resources and defined some heuristic methods to help the translation more precise. Our approach has been validated to be highly effective for the Bahnaric-Vietnamese translation model, contributing to the expansion and preservation of languages, and facilitating better mutual understanding between the two ethnic people.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the adverse effects of reasoning-enhanced prompting methods like chain-of-thought on instruction-following accuracy in large language models.

**Method:** The authors evaluate 15 models on two benchmarks, IFEval and ComplexBench, and conduct large-scale case studies alongside attention-based analysis to examine performance variations with chain-of-thought prompting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Systematic identification of performance degradation due to chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models.
	2. Introduction of the metric 'constraint attention' to quantify model focus during language generation.
	3. Evaluation of novel strategies (in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, classifier-selective reasoning) to recover lost performance.

**Result:** The performance of models dropped when using chain-of-thought prompts due to a diversion of attention from instruction-relevant tokens, along with the introduction of unnecessary content. Four mitigation strategies were introduced, notably classifier-selective reasoning, which improved model performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study is the first to systematically identify reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following tasks and offers practical strategies to counteract these issues.

**Abstract:** Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of GODBench benchmark for evaluating creative video comment generation
	2. Development of the Ripple of Thought framework to enhance MLLM creativity

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the challenges faced by current MLLMs in creative tasks and suggest that RoT can lead to advancements in MLLM-based creative applications.

**Abstract:** Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity. GODBench is publicly available at https://github.com/stan-lei/GODBench-ACL2025.

**Motivation:** The study aims to better understand how data compression correlates with the capabilities of LLMs in specialized domains like code intelligence, challenging previous linear assumptions.

**Method:** The authors introduce Format Annealing, a lightweight training methodology for evaluating open-source Code LLMs across multi-language and multi-task benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Format Annealing for fair evaluation of Code LLMs
	2. Identification of a logarithmic relationship between code intelligence and compression
	3. Development of a novel evaluation framework using a large-scale code validation set from GitHub.

**Result:** The study reveals a logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and bits-per-character (BPC), refining previous linearity hypotheses.

**Limitations:** The work is still in progress and may require further validation and refinement.

**Conclusion:** This work enhances the understanding of compression in code intelligence development and establishes a robust evaluation framework for code-based LLMs.

**Abstract:** Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

**Abstract:** Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess the quality of taxonomies without relying on reference standards, addressing gaps in existing metrics.

**Method:** Developed a robustness metric based on the correlation of semantic and taxonomic similarity, and a logical adequacy metric using Natural Language Inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First metric evaluates robustness through correlation with semantic similarity.
	2. Second metric uses Natural Language Inference for logical adequacy assessment.
	3. Both metrics show strong correlation with established gold-standard evaluations.

**Result:** Both metrics demonstrated a strong correlation with F1 scores compared to gold-standard taxonomies in tests across five different taxonomies.

**Limitations:** Metrics depend on the selection of taxonomies tested, and their applicability to diverse domains needs further exploration.

**Conclusion:** The proposed metrics effectively evaluate taxonomy quality, providing new tools for researchers and practitioners.

The first metric evaluates robustness by calculating the correlation between semantic and taxonomic similarity, covering a type of error not handled by existing metrics. The second uses Natural Language Inference to assess logical adequacy. Both metrics are tested on five taxonomies and are shown to correlate well with F1 against gold-standard taxonomies.

**Motivation:** The potential of LLMs for code optimization in assembly language remains largely underexplored, particularly in achieving high performance optimizations that are hard to express in high-level programming languages.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning can effectively enable LLMs to optimize assembly code performance, showcasing their potential beyond high-level programming tasks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve reasoning performance during inference by allowing diverse exploration of thinking paths in continuous latent space.

**Method:** Introduced SoftCoT++ which extends SoftCoT by perturbing latent thoughts with multiple specialized initial tokens and applying contrastive learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SoftCoT++
	2. Enhancement of reasoning performance through diverse exploration
	3. Strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques

**Result:** SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT's performance and outperforms it with self-consistency scaling on five reasoning benchmarks with strong compatibility with existing scaling techniques.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SoftCoT++ provides a novel approach to continuous-space reasoning that enhances performance while allowing diverse explorations of thought pathways.

**Abstract:** Test-Time Scaling (TTS) refers to approaches that improve reasoning performance by allocating extra computation during inference, without altering the model's parameters. While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is available at https://github.com/xuyige/SoftCoT.

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates transformer-based language models in relation to gaze duration during reading, finding they outperform earlier models but still do not fully capture human predictability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the relationship between advanced NLP models and cognitive processes in language comprehension, specifically focusing on Gaze Duration during reading.

**Method:** Evaluation of transformer-based models (GPT2, LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA2-7B) on gaze durations recorded from Rioplantense Spanish readers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated improved performance of transformer models over traditional models regarding gaze duration predictions.
	2. Highlighted the limitations of transformer models in fully capturing human cognitive predictability during reading.

**Result:** Transformer-based models outperform previous models, showing better predictive capacity for Gaze Durations, but still do not fully explain the variance captured by human predictability.

**Limitations:** Transformer models do not account for all the variance in gaze duration related to human predictability, indicating a gap between model predictions and actual human behavior.

**Conclusion:** State-of-the-art language models, despite their advancements, predict language processing differently from human readers.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the development of highly sophisticated language models for text generation. In parallel, neuroscience has increasingly employed these models to explore cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. Previous research has shown that models such as N-grams and LSTM networks can partially account for predictability effects in explaining eye movement behaviors, specifically Gaze Duration, during reading. In this study, we extend these findings by evaluating transformer-based models (GPT2, LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA2-7B) to further investigate this relationship. Our results indicate that these architectures outperform earlier models in explaining the variance in Gaze Durations recorded from Rioplantense Spanish readers. However, similar to previous studies, these models still fail to account for the entirety of the variance captured by human predictability. These findings suggest that, despite their advancements, state-of-the-art language models continue to predict language in ways that differ from human readers.

**TL;DR:** The Fourier Transformer reduces computational costs in transformer models using the Fast Fourier Transform, allowing weight inheritance from pretrained models, achieving state-of-the-art performances on benchmarks.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiencies of the transformer model in handling long sequences due to its quadratic complexity, while still enabling the model to inherit weights from large pretrained models.

**Method:** The paper introduces the Fourier Transformer, which uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to perform Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) to remove redundancies in hidden sequences.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Fourier Transformer to improve efficiency in long-sequence tasks.
	2. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on the long-range modeling benchmark LRA.
	3. Ability to inherit from various large pretrained models while utilizing FFT for computational efficiency.

**Result:** The Fourier Transformer significantly reduces computational costs and retains the ability to inherit weights, outperforming standard transformer models, including BART, on various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This new approach demonstrates that it is possible to enhance transformer efficiency without sacrificing weight inheritance, achieving better performance on generative tasks.

**Abstract:** The transformer model is known to be computationally demanding, and prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the self-attention module uses a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to sequence length. Many researchers have focused on designing new forms of self-attention or introducing new parameters to overcome this limitation, however a large portion of them prohibits the model to inherit weights from large pretrained models. In this work, the transformer's inefficiency has been taken care of from another perspective. We propose Fourier Transformer, a simple yet effective approach by progressively removing redundancies in hidden sequence using the ready-made Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator to perform Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). Fourier Transformer is able to significantly reduce computational costs while retain the ability to inherit from various large pretrained models. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances among all transformer-based models on the long-range modeling benchmark LRA with significant improvement in both speed and space. For generative seq-to-seq tasks including CNN/DailyMail and ELI5, by inheriting the BART weights our model outperforms the standard BART and other efficient models.

**Keywords:** authorship verification, speaker attribution, transcribed speech, conversation transcripts, neural models

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates authorship verification for transcribed speech, presenting a new benchmark and analyzing the effectiveness of various models.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the novel challenges of authorship verification in transcribed speech, where traditional stylistic features of written text are less informative.

**Method:** The authors propose a new benchmark for speaker attribution specific to human-transcribed conversational speech transcripts, employing conversation prompts and controlled trials to mitigate speaker-topic associations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a new benchmark for author verification in conversational speech transcripts.
	2. Insights on the effectiveness of existing written text attribution models in new contexts.
	3. Analysis of the influence of transcription style on model performance.

**Result:** The study establishes state-of-the-art performance on the new benchmark, revealing that while written text attribution models perform adequately, their effectiveness decreases as conversational topic control increases.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Fine-tuning on speech transcripts can significantly enhance performance, and the analysis provides insights into how transcription styles impact model efficacy.

**Abstract:** Authorship verification is the task of determining if two distinct writing samples share the same author and is typically concerned with the attribution of written text. In this paper, we explore the attribution of transcribed speech, which poses novel challenges. The main challenge is that many stylistic features, such as punctuation and capitalization, are not informative in this setting. On the other hand, transcribed speech exhibits other patterns, such as filler words and backchannels (e.g., 'um', 'uh-huh'), which may be characteristic of different speakers. We propose a new benchmark for speaker attribution focused on human-transcribed conversational speech transcripts. To limit spurious associations of speakers with topic, we employ both conversation prompts and speakers participating in the same conversation to construct verification trials of varying difficulties. We establish the state of the art on this new benchmark by comparing a suite of neural and non-neural baselines, finding that although written text attribution models achieve surprisingly good performance in certain settings, they perform markedly worse as conversational topic is increasingly controlled. We present analyses of the impact of transcription style on performance as well as the ability of fine-tuning on speech transcripts to improve performance.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, bias, contextual evaluation, COBIAS, human judgment

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new framework for evaluating bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by considering contextual factors, leading to the development of the Context-Oriented Bias Indicator and Assessment Score (COBIAS).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current bias evaluation methods for LLMs do not adequately consider the context in which biased statements are made, limiting their effectiveness in bias mitigation.

**Method:** The authors developed the COBIAS metric, which evaluates the reliability of biased statements based on model behavior across various contexts, assessed using augmented stereotyped statements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a contextual reliability framework for LLM bias evaluation.
	2. Development of the COBIAS metric that incorporates context.
	3. Demonstration of COBIAS's alignment with human judgment on bias reliability.

**Result:** The study shows that COBIAS aligns well with human judgments, demonstrating a significant correlation, enabling the creation of more reliable benchmarks for bias assessment.

**Limitations:** The study relies on existing benchmark datasets for bias, which may have their own limitations and biases.

**Conclusion:** COBIAS can enhance bias evaluation by integrating context into assessments and can aid in developing more effective bias mitigation strategies for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often inherit biases from the web data they are trained on, which contains stereotypes and prejudices. Current methods for evaluating and mitigating these biases rely on bias-benchmark datasets. These benchmarks measure bias by observing an LLM's behavior on biased statements. However, these statements lack contextual considerations of the situations they try to present. To address this, we introduce a contextual reliability framework, which evaluates model robustness to biased statements by considering the various contexts in which they may appear. We develop the Context-Oriented Bias Indicator and Assessment Score (COBIAS) to measure a biased statement's reliability in detecting bias, based on the variance in model behavior across different contexts. To evaluate the metric, we augmented 2,291 stereotyped statements from two existing benchmark datasets by adding contextual information. We show that COBIAS aligns with human judgment on the contextual reliability of biased statements (Spearman's $\rho = 0.65, p = 3.4 * 10^{-60}$) and can be used to create reliable benchmarks, which would assist bias mitigation works.

**Motivation:** Enhance the understanding of scene text in visual question answering models and address gaps in current datasets and methodologies.

**Method:** Introduced a novel method called ViTextBLIP-2 which integrates a frozen Vision Transformer, SwinTextSpotter OCR, and ViT5 LLM, along with a trainable Q-Former for multimodal feature fusion.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First large-scale Vietnamese dataset for VQA focusing on scene text comprehension
	2. Development of ViTextBLIP-2 for multimodal feature fusion in VQA

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the importance of token processing order in OCR text for improving answer formulation in VQA tasks, emphasizing the effectiveness of the ViTextVQA dataset and proposed method.

**Abstract:** Visual Question Answerinng (VQA) is a complicated task that requires the capability of simultaneously processing natural language and images. This task was initially researched with a focus on developing methods to help machines understand objects and scene contexts in images. However, some scene text that carries explicit information about the full content of the image is not mentioned. Along with the continuous development of the AI era, there have been many studies on the reading comprehension ability of VQA models in the world. Therefore, we introduce the first large-scale dataset in Vietnamese specializing in the ability to understand scene text, we call it ViTextVQA (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Text}-based \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering dataset) which contains \textbf{over 16,000} images and \textbf{over 50,000} questions with answers. To tackle this task efficiently, we propose ViTextBLIP-2, an novel multimodal feature fusion Method, which optimizes Vietnamese OCR-based VQA by integrating a frozen Vision Transformer, SwinTextSpotter OCR, and ViT5 LLM with a trainable Q-Former for multimodal feature fusion. Through experiments with various state-of-the-art models, we uncover the significance of the order in which tokens in OCR text are processed and selected to formulate answers. This finding helped us significantly improve the performance of the baseline models on the ViTextVQA dataset. Our dataset is available (https://github.com/minhquan6203/ViTextVQA-Dataset) for research purposes.

**Motivation:** To address patient data privacy concerns and computational costs associated with proprietary LLMs in healthcare, focusing on locally-hosted models for clinical text summarization.

**Method:** The adaptation process involved continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning through a novel approach called DistillDirect, utilizing Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of LLaMA-Clinic for clinical note generation
	2. Novel reinforcement learning approach (DistillDirect) for on-policy training
	3. Empirical validation through physician evaluations displaying high acceptance rates

**Result:** LLaMA-Clinic was developed to generate high-quality clinical notes, achieving a 90.4% acceptance rate in blinded evaluations by physician readers and scoring higher than physician notes in the Assessment and Plan section.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the importance of pre-defining best-practice note formats for clinical documentation instead of relying solely on LLM output.

**Abstract:** Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising capabilities in clinical text summarization tasks. However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. In the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness than physician-authored notes (4.1/5). We highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format, rather than relying on LLMs to determine this for clinical practice.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Self-Tuning represents a substantial advancement in enabling LLMs to continually learn from new documents and maintain their prior knowledge effectively.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to provide up-to-date information due to their one-time training and the constantly evolving nature of the world. To keep LLMs current, existing approaches typically involve continued pre-training on new documents. However, they frequently face difficulties in extracting stored knowledge. Motivated by the remarkable success of the Feynman Technique in efficient human learning, we introduce Self-Tuning, a learning framework aimed at improving an LLM's ability to effectively acquire new knowledge from unseen raw documents through self-teaching. Specifically, we develop a Self-Teaching strategy that augments the documents with a set of knowledge-intensive tasks created in a self-supervised manner, focusing on three crucial aspects: memorization, comprehension, and self-reflection. Additionally, we introduce three Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA datasets to facilitate an in-depth analysis of an LLM's knowledge acquisition ability concerning memorization, extraction, and reasoning. Extensive experimental results on various models, e.g., Llama2-7B reveal that Self-Tuning consistently exhibits superior performance across all knowledge acquisition tasks and excels in preserving previous knowledge.

	3. Measurement of semantic leakage in 13 flagship models across various languages and scenarios.

**Result:** Significant levels of semantic leakage were detected in multiple models across different settings, revealing that this issue is prevalent beyond English and affects generation patterns.

**Limitations:** The study focuses only on a limited set of language models and may not capture all aspects of semantic leakage in less prominent models.

**Conclusion:** Semantic leakage is a newly identified bias in language models that impacts their behavior and generation, necessitating further study and consideration in their evaluation.

**Abstract:** Despite their wide adoption, the biases and unintended behaviors of language models remain poorly understood. In this paper, we identify and characterize a phenomenon never discussed before, which we call semantic leakage, where models leak irrelevant information from the prompt into the generation in unexpected ways. We propose an evaluation setting to detect semantic leakage both by humans and automatically, curate a diverse test suite for diagnosing this behavior, and measure significant semantic leakage in 13 flagship models. We also show that models exhibit semantic leakage in languages besides English and across different settings and generation scenarios. This discovery highlights yet another type of bias in language models that affects their generation patterns and behavior.

**Method:** AnnualBERT uses whole words as tokens, consisting of a base RoBERTa model pretrained on arXiv papers and progressively trained models on annual data, enhancing representation learning and tracking changes over time.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of whole-word tokenization in language models
	2. Demonstration of improved performance in specific NLP tasks
	3. Insights into the temporal evolution of scientific discourse

**Result:** AnnualBERT models show comparable performances in standard NLP tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results in domain-specific tasks and link prediction within the arXiv citation network.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AnnualBERT enhances scientific text processing and provides valuable insights into how scientific discourse evolves, with the models available for public use.

**Abstract:** We introduce AnnualBERT, a series of language models designed specifically to capture the temporal evolution of scientific text. Deviating from the prevailing paradigms of subword tokenizations and "one model to rule them all", AnnualBERT adopts whole words as tokens and is composed of a base RoBERTa model pretrained from scratch on the full-text of 1.7 million arXiv papers published until 2008 and a collection of progressively trained models on arXiv papers at an annual basis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AnnualBERT models by showing that they not only have comparable performances in standard tasks but also achieve state-of-the-art performances on domain-specific NLP tasks as well as link prediction tasks in the arXiv citation network. We then utilize probing tasks to quantify the models' behavior in terms of representation learning and forgetting as time progresses. Our approach enables the pretrained models to not only improve performances on scientific text processing tasks but also to provide insights into the development of scientific discourse over time. The series of the models is available at https://huggingface.co/jd445/AnnualBERTs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** sexism, misogyny, automated detection, interdisciplinary research, systematic review

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper conducts a systematic literature review on computational tools for detecting sexism and misogyny in online spaces, providing insights into the current state of research and key gaps.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To capture the current state and trajectory of the evolving field of sexism and misogyny detection, addressing the increasing concern over gender-based discrimination online.

**Method:** A systematic literature review synthesizing existing research into five core themes, using a semi-automated review process guided by PRISMA.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Synthesis of literature into five themes: definitions, disciplinary divergences, detection methods, challenges, and interventions.
	2. Interdisciplinary approach to bridge methodological divides.
	3. Identification of critical gaps in the field, including the need for intersectional and non-Western perspectives.

**Result:** Identified five key themes in the literature and highlighted significant gaps, such as the need for intersectional approaches and proactive design strategies.

**Limitations:** Limited focus on proactive design strategies beyond text classification and under-representation of non-Western perspectives.

**Conclusion:** Current methodologies reveal a clear disciplinary divide regarding the conceptualization and measurement of sexism and misogyny, necessitating further interdisciplinary collaboration.

**Abstract:** Several computational tools have been developed to detect and identify sexism, misogyny, and gender-based hate speech, particularly on online platforms. These tools draw on insights from both social science and computer science. Given the increasing concern over gender-based discrimination in digital spaces, the contested definitions and measurements of sexism, and the rise of interdisciplinary efforts to understand its online manifestations, a systematic literature review is essential for capturing the current state and trajectory of this evolving field. In this review, we make four key contributions: (1) we synthesize the literature into five core themes: definitions of sexism and misogyny, disciplinary divergences, automated detection methods, associated challenges, and design-based interventions; (2) we adopt an interdisciplinary lens, bridging theoretical and methodological divides across disciplines; (3) we highlight critical gaps, including the need for intersectional approaches, the under-representation of non-Western languages and perspectives, and the limited focus on proactive design strategies beyond text classification; and (4) we offer a methodological contribution by applying a rigorous semi-automated systematic review process guided by PRISMA, establishing a replicable standard for future work in this domain. Our findings reveal a clear disciplinary divide in how sexism and misogyny are conceptualized and measured. Through an evidence-based synthesis, we examine how existing studies have attempted to bridge this gap through interdisciplinary collaboration. Drawing on both social science theories and computational modeling practices, we assess the strengths and limitations of current methodologies. Finally, we outline key challenges and future directions for advancing research on the detection and mitigation of online sexism and misogyny.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This survey focuses on the design and optimization of scaffolded language models (LMs) that integrate into multi-step processes, exploring their training with language supervision and the implications for real-world applications.

**Read time:** 20 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To organize the literature on scaffolded LMs which utilize language for non-parametric training and optimize processes in multi-step settings with tools.

**Method:** The paper surveys existing research on scaffolded LMs and their training paradigms, particularly how they handle language feedback in real-time applications.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the concept of scaffolded LMs.
	2. Discussion on streaming learning from language supervision in mixed-autonomy settings.
	3. Insights into the optimization of LMs using language feedback.

**Result:** The survey reveals how scaffolded LMs optimize language-based supervision and continuously improve through real-time user feedback, mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the importance of language-based optimization in improving scaffolded LMs for practical applications, particularly in collaborative environments with mixed autonomy.

**Abstract:** This survey organizes the intricate literature on the design and optimization of emerging structures around post-trained LMs. We refer to this overarching structure as scaffolded LMs and focus on LMs that are integrated into multi-step processes with tools. We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric models wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools, and scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and receive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to interpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to intricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of scaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric training is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in learning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement learning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss functions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and expressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and supporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are increasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot in Office tools or software development. In these mixed-autonomy settings, where control and decision-making are shared between human and AI, users point out errors or suggest corrections. Accordingly, we discuss agents that continuously improve by learning from this real-time, language-based feedback and refer to this setting as streaming learning from language supervision.

**TL;DR:** Proposes ShifCon, a framework to enhance multilingual LLM performance by improving non-dominant language representations through a shift-based contrastive approach.

**Read time:** 20 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the performance gap in LLMs between dominant languages (like English) and non-dominant languages due to uneven training data.

**Method:** Introduces ShifCon, which shifts non-dominant language representations into a dominant language subspace for enhancement, coupled with multilingual contrastive learning for better alignment.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ShifCon framework for language representation enhancement
	2. Development of subspace distance metric for optimal representation shifting
	3. Application of multilingual contrastive learning to improve representation alignment

**Result:** Experiments show ShifCon significantly improves performance for non-dominant languages, especially low-resource ones.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ShifCon enables enhanced representation access and insights that can drive further research in multilingual LLMs.

**Abstract:** Although fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multilingual data can rapidly enhance the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit a performance gap between the dominant language (e.g., English) and non-dominant ones due to the imbalance of training data across languages. To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment of representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon framework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages, particularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to verify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To critique the quality of Wikipedia as a resource for NLP in non-English languages, especially in low-resource settings.

**Method:** Various quality filtering techniques were applied to Wikipedia data to evaluate its quality in a non-English context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified widespread data quality issues in Wikipedia for low-resource languages.
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of quality filtering for improving NLP training efficiency.
	3. Advocated for language-specific data quality definitions.

**Result:** The study reveals significant issues with data quality in Wikipedia, including many one-line and duplicate articles, and demonstrates that quality pruning can enhance resource-efficient training without harming performance.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on low-resource languages and may not generalize to high-resource contexts.

**Conclusion:** The research encourages a shift towards language- and task-specific definitions of data quality, providing guidelines for using Wikipedia in multilingual pretraining.

**Abstract:** Wikipedia's perceived high quality and broad language coverage have established it as a fundamental resource in multilingual NLP. In the context of low-resource languages, however, these quality assumptions are increasingly being scrutinised. This paper critically examines the data quality of Wikipedia in a non-English setting by subjecting it to various quality filtering techniques, revealing widespread issues such as a high percentage of one-line articles and duplicate articles. We evaluate the downstream impact of quality filtering on Wikipedia and find that data quality pruning is an effective means for resource-efficient training without hurting performance, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, we advocate for a shift in perspective from seeking a general definition of data quality towards a more language- and task-specific one. Ultimately, we aim for this study to serve as a guide to using Wikipedia for pretraining in a multilingual setting.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework (UniHR) to improve link prediction in complex knowledge graphs, integrating various fact representations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a growing need for effective models that can generalize across different complex fact representations such as hyper-relational, temporal, and nested facts due to their increasing complexity.

**Method:** The UniHR framework includes a Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module that transforms various complex knowledge graph forms into triple-based representations, and a Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module for intra-fact and inter-fact message passing to enhance semantic and structural information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a unified framework for link prediction in complex knowledge graphs.
	2. Development of modules for effective fact representation and message passing.
	3. Empirical validation of the framework's performance across different fact types.

**Result:** Empirical results show that the UniHR framework effectively captures the complexities of various fact types in knowledge graphs, demonstrating improved link prediction performance compared to existing models.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the data types tested and the specific configurations of the models; further studies could explore additional fact types and applications.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the potential of unified representations in advancing the current state of link prediction for complex knowledge graphs and provides accessible resources for replication.

**Abstract:** Beyond-triple fact representations including hyper-relational facts with auxiliary key-value pairs, temporal facts with additional timestamps, and nested facts implying relationships between facts, are gaining significant attention. However, constrained by complex fact representation forms, existing link prediction models for beyond-triple facts have difficulty achieving hierarchical fact modeling and generalizing the modules for one specific facts to other fact types. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework (UniHR) for unified knowledge graph link prediction. It consists of a unified Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module as graph encoder. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing the semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified representations. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/UniHR.

**Motivation:** To explore how speech-based toxicity detection mitigates biases present in text-based systems.

**Method:** The study involved creating high-quality annotations for the multilingual MuTox dataset and comparing speech and text-based toxicity classifiers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed high-quality group annotations for the MuTox dataset.
	2. Demonstrated that speech classifiers reduce text-based biases in toxicity detection.
	3. Provided recommendations for future toxicity dataset construction.

**Result:** Speech-based classifiers showed reduced bias against demographic group mentions, especially in ambiguous cases, unlike text-based classifiers.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Enhancing classifiers is more effective for reducing group bias than improving transcription methods; annotations are publicly available.

**Abstract:** Text toxicity detection systems exhibit significant biases, producing disproportionate rates of false positives on samples mentioning demographic groups. But what about toxicity detection in speech? To investigate the extent to which text-based biases are mitigated by speech-based systems, we produce a set of high-quality group annotations for the multilingual MuTox dataset, and then leverage these annotations to systematically compare speech- and text-based toxicity classifiers. Our findings indicate that access to speech data during inference supports reduced bias against group mentions, particularly for ambiguous and disagreement-inducing samples. Our results also suggest that improving classifiers, rather than transcription pipelines, is more helpful for reducing group bias. We publicly release our annotations and provide recommendations for future toxicity dataset construction.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that improves their ability to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain when it is not, enhancing reliability and user trust.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of conventional LLMs in scenarios where relevant information is lacking, thereby improving robustness.

**Method:** Introduction of Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a training-free decoding technique that assesses the relevance of both parametric and contextual knowledge sources and adaptively decides which to use.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a controlled testbed for assessing LLM knowledge access scenarios
	2. Proposition of a new method (CDA) for LLMs to handle knowledge limitation effectively
	3. Demonstration of improved reliability in model outputs through abstention

**Result:** CDA demonstrates a significant improvement in generating accurate responses while allowing for abstention when necessary, thus enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CDA not only improves LLM performance in knowledge-scarce situations but also preserves user trust by managing response generation appropriately.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across diverse tasks by leveraging pre-trained (i.e., parametric) and external (i.e., contextual) knowledge. While substantial efforts have been made to enhance the utilization of both forms of knowledge, situations in which models lack relevant information remain underexplored. To investigate this challenge, we first present a controlled testbed featuring four distinct knowledge access scenarios, including the aforementioned edge case, revealing that conventional LLM usage exhibits insufficient robustness in handling all instances. Addressing this limitation, we propose Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a novel training-free decoding method that allows LLMs to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain otherwise. CDA estimates the relevance of both knowledge sources for a given input, adaptively deciding which type of information to prioritize and which to exclude. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CDA can effectively perform accurate generation and abstention simultaneously, enhancing reliability and preserving user trust.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores an automated approach inspired by the Chain of Evidence (CoE) to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in multi-hop question answering by distinguishing relevant from irrelevant external knowledge.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Incorporating external knowledge into LLMs can reduce outdated knowledge and hallucinations but often includes irrelevant or misleading information.

**Method:** The paper proposes an automated CoE discrimination approach to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to generating accurate and faithful responses, specifically in multi-hop QA scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed an automated CoE discrimination approach for LLMs.
	2. Demonstrated improvements in accuracy, faithfulness, and robustness with CoE.
	3. Provided insights into applying CoE in practical RAG contexts.

**Result:** Tests on five LLMs indicate that CoE enhances generation accuracy, strengthens answer faithfulness, and improves robustness against knowledge conflicts.

**Limitations:** The approach relies on the quality of external knowledge and may not fully overcome all issues related to misinformation.

**Conclusion:** Utilizing CoE leads to overall better performance of LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios by improving response quality.

**Abstract:** Incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate outdated knowledge and hallucination in LLMs. However, external knowledge is often imperfect. In addition to useful knowledge, external knowledge is rich in irrelevant or misinformation in the context that can impair the reliability of LLM responses. This paper focuses on LLMs' preferred external knowledge in imperfect contexts when handling multi-hop QA. Inspired by criminal procedural law's Chain of Evidence (CoE), we characterize that knowledge preferred by LLMs should maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among knowledge pieces. Accordingly, we propose an automated CoE discrimination approach and evaluate LLMs' effectiveness, faithfulness and robustness with CoE, including its application in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Tests on five LLMs show CoE improves generation accuracy, answer faithfulness, robustness to knowledge conflicts, and boosts the performance of existing approaches in three practical RAG scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the importance of diagnosing failure points in RAG systems and offers insights for optimizations in response to these challenges.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) synergizes the retrieval of pertinent data with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring that the generated output is not only contextually relevant but also accurate and current. We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.

**Read time:** 20 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the vulnerabilities of LLM-based search engines to ranking manipulation attacks and propose methods for mitigating these threats.

**Method:** Analyzed the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks through a game-theoretic approach using the Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma to identify conditions for cooperation among players.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Theoretical framework for understanding ranking manipulation in LLMs
	2. Identification of conditions supporting cooperation in adversarial settings
	3. Insights into the paradoxical effects of certain defensive strategies

**Result:** Identified key factors influencing cooperation, including attack costs and success rates, and demonstrated paradoxical outcomes where reducing attack success rates could incentivize more attacks.

**Limitations:** Focuses on a theoretical analysis and does not provide empirical validation of findings.

**Conclusion:** Adaptive security strategies and careful design of ecosystems are crucial for mitigating vulnerabilities in LLM-based systems, as simplistic defensive measures may be ineffective.

**Abstract:** The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in understanding user responses to LLM refusals, particularly those based on ethical considerations.

**Method:** Analyzed nearly 50,000 model comparisons from Chatbot Arena to study user preferences and employed a RoBERTa-based refusal classifier to differentiate between types of refusals.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Large-scale analysis of user preferences in LLM responses
	2. Development of a RoBERTa-based classifier for refusal types
	3. Insights into user satisfaction versus ethical considerations in LLM design

**Result:** Ethical refusals led to lower win rates compared to technical refusals and standard responses. However, sensitive prompts received more favorable evaluations when refusals were contextually appropriate.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight a conflict between safety-aligned LLM behaviors and user expectations, suggesting the need for adaptive moderation strategies.

**Abstract:** LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. In particular, little is known about how users respond when models refuse to answer a prompt-one of the primary mechanisms used to enforce ethical boundaries in LLMs. We address this gap by analyzing nearly 50,000 model comparisons from Chatbot Arena, a platform where users indicate their preferred LLM response in pairwise matchups, providing a large-scale setting for studying real-world user preferences. Using a novel RoBERTa-based refusal classifier fine-tuned on a hand-labeled dataset, we distinguish between refusals due to ethical concerns and technical limitations. Our results reveal a substantial refusal penalty: ethical refusals yield significantly lower win rates than both technical refusals and standard responses, indicating that users are especially dissatisfied when models decline a task for ethical reasons. However, this penalty is not uniform. Refusals receive more favorable evaluations when the underlying prompt is highly sensitive (e.g., involving illegal content), and when the refusal is phrased in a detailed and contextually aligned manner. These findings underscore a core tension in LLM design: safety-aligned behaviors may conflict with user expectations, calling for more adaptive moderation strategies that account for context and presentation.

**TL;DR:** TreeKV is a new method for efficient caching in transformer-based LLMs that enhances context retention while allowing for significant cache size reduction.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Efficient KV cache compression is necessary for improving performance of transformer-based LLMs in resource-limited settings, especially for long sequences.

**Method:** TreeKV uses a tree structure for smooth cache compression, avoiding position-based and global importance biases. It operates in both generation and prefilling stages without requiring training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TreeKV, a training-free cache compression method
	2. Demonstrated significant performance improvement in long-context LLM scenarios
	3. Achieved a 16x reduction in cache size with maintained output quality

**Result:** TreeKV outperforms existing models in language modeling tasks (PG19, OpenWebText2) and successfully reduces cache size by 16x while maintaining high-quality outputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TreeKV achieves superior efficiency, with optimal performance on the Longbench benchmark at just 6% of the budget.

**Abstract:** Efficient key-value (KV) cache compression is critical for scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in long sequences and resource-limited settings. Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating user confirmations as a friction turn results in significant performance gains in dialogue state tracking while reducing overreliance on AI agents.

**Abstract:** Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents. However, they are also well known to hallucinate, producing responses that seem plausible but are factually incorrect. On the other hand, users tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents, accepting AI's suggestion even when it is wrong. Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for LLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via friction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with dialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM with an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to predict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation. We perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established benchmarks (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but also guides the decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around 3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy (JGA) of DST output by incorporating accountability heads into modern LLMs. Self-correcting the detected errors further increases the JGA from 67.13 to 70.51, achieving state-of-the-art DST performance. Finally, we show that error correction through user confirmations (friction turn) achieves a similar performance gain, highlighting its potential to reduce user overreliance.

Strategies relying on training with medical datasets are highly cost-intensive and may suffer from outdated training data. Leveraging external knowledge bases is a suitable alternative, yet it faces obstacles such as limited retrieval precision and poor effectiveness in answer extraction.

**Abstract:** Social media platforms utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation algorithms to maximize user engagement, which can result in inadvertent exposure to harmful content. Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates random noise in web-scale pre-training datasets for LLMs using a cohesive framework, revealing unexpected results about its impact on model performance and introducing a novel loss function to enhance denoising capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the impact of random noise in web-sourced data for training LLMs, seeking to understand its effects on model performance and provide solutions.

**Method:** The authors employ a 'What-Why-How' framework to systematically investigate random noise, providing theoretical justifications and conducting experiments with a Local Gradient Matching loss to improve model performance in downstream tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First systematic investigation of random noise in LLM training datasets.
	2. Introduction of the Local Gradient Matching loss to enhance denoising.
	3. Validation of findings through experiments on multiple language and vision benchmarks.

**Result:** The increase in next-token prediction loss due to noise was lower than expected, and the Local Gradient Matching loss was validated to enhance denoising in downstream tasks across various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** The study explores a specific aspect of data quality, but it may not cover all forms of noise or their interactions with model architectures.

**Conclusion:** Random noise affects downstream task performance negatively, and the introduced Local Gradient Matching loss can effectively mitigate this issue.

**Abstract:** Web-scale pre-training datasets are the cornerstone of LLMs' success. However, text data curated from the Internet inevitably contains random noise caused by decoding errors or unregulated web content. In contrast to previous works that focus on low quality or synthetic data, our study \textbf{provides the first systematic investigation of such random noise through a cohesive ``What-Why-How'' framework.} Surprisingly, we observed that the resulting increase in the loss of next-token prediction (NTP) was significantly lower than the proportion of random noise even when the model was scaled up to 2.7B. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon, which also elucidates the success of multilingual models and can be applied to multimodal models. On the other hand, experiments show that the model's performance in downstream tasks is not based solely on the NTP loss, which means that random noise may result in degraded downstream performance. To address the potential adverse effects, we introduce a novel plug-and-play Local Gradient Matching loss, which explicitly enhances the denoising capability of the downstream task head by aligning the gradient of normal and perturbed features without requiring knowledge of the model's parameters. Additional experiments on 8 language and 14 vision benchmarks further validate its effectiveness.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Model merging, particularly with the RESM method, offers a promising approach to better alignment of large language models concerning Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness.

**Abstract:** Achieving balanced alignment of large language models (LLMs) in terms of Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness (3H optimization) constitutes a cornerstone of responsible AI. Existing methods like data mixture strategies face limitations, including heavy reliance on expert knowledge and conflicting optimization signals. While model merging offers parameter-level conflict-resolution strategies through integrating specialized models' parameters, its potential for 3H optimization remains underexplored. This paper systematically compares the effectiveness of model merging and data mixture methods in constructing 3H-aligned LLMs for the first time, revealing previously overlooked collaborative and conflict relationships among the 3H dimensions and discussing the advantages and drawbacks of data mixture (\textit{data-level}) and model merging (\textit{parameter-level}) methods in mitigating the conflict for balanced 3H optimization. Specially, we propose a novel \textbf{R}eweighting \textbf{E}nhanced task \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{M}erging method, \textbf{RESM}, through outlier weighting and sparsity-aware rank selection strategies to address the challenges of preference noise accumulation and layer sparsity adaptation inherent in 3H-aligned LLM merging. Extensive evaluations can verify the effectiveness and robustness of RESM compared to previous data mixture (2\%-5\% gain) and model merging (1\%-3\% gain) methods in achieving balanced LLM alignment. We release our models through \href{https://huggingface.co/Jinluan}{3H\_Merging} for further investigations.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle with accurate information retrieval, necessitating an improved approach for enhancing their capabilities.

**Method:** MEAP integrates Masked Language Modeling with Next-Token Prediction by masking input tokens and using a decoder-only Transformer for autoregressive prediction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposing the MEAP training paradigm for LLMs
	2. Demonstrating superior performance in information retrieval and reasoning tasks
	3. Highlighting the mechanism that improves attention scores in language models

**Result:** MEAP significantly outperforms NTP in key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, and also shows superior performance in supervised fine-tuning scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MEAP's emphasis on a smaller set of non-masked tokens enhances task-relevant focus in LLM training, making it an effective paradigm for improving model performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in large language models, which have implications for their reliability in applications.

**Method:** Empirical investigation of the relationship between monofact rates and hallucination, and the introduction of selective upweighting during training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First empirical investigation of the relationship between monofact rates and hallucination in language models.
	2. Development of selective upweighting technique that reduces hallucination significantly.
	3. Findings challenge the efficacy of universal deduplication policies in training language models.

**Result:** Selective upweighting can reduce hallucination by up to 40% without sacrificing accuracy, challenging existing deduplication policies.

**Limitations:** Focuses on specific models and empirical settings; results may not generalize universally across all types of language models.

**Conclusion:** The trade-off between maintaining accuracy and reducing hallucination highlights a key optimization challenge in model training.

**Abstract:** Hallucinated facts in large language models (LLMs) have recently been shown to obey a statistical lower bound determined by the monofact rate (related to the classical Good-Turing missing mass estimator) minus model miscalibration (Kalai & Vempala, 2024). We present the first empirical investigation of this three-way relationship in classical n-gram models and fine-tuned encoder-decoder Transformers. By generating training data from Pareto distributions with varying shape parameters, we systematically control the monofact rates and establish its positive relationship with hallucination. To bridge theory and practice, we derive an empirical analog of the hallucination bound by replacing the population miscalibration term (Section 2.1) with an empirical bin-wise KL divergence and confirm its practical viability. We then introduce selective upweighting -- a simple yet effective technique that strategically repeats as little as 5% of training examples -- to deliberately inject miscalibration into the model. This intervention reduces hallucination by up to 40%, challenging universal deduplication policies. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: selective upweighting maintains pre-injection levels of accuracy while substantially reducing hallucination, whereas standard training gradually improves accuracy but fails to address persistently high hallucination, indicating an inherent tension in optimization objectives.

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to address the challenges faced by mRAG systems in retrieving relevant information across diverse linguistic contexts and improving the consistency of generated responses.

**Method:** The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze language preferences in mRAG for both retrieval and generation processes, leading to the development of the Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG) framework.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of language preferences in mRAG systems
	2. Introduction of the Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG) framework

**Result:** Empirical results show that DKM-RAG reduces language preference issues in generation and improves performance significantly across various linguistic settings.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that integrating translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge effectively addresses inconsistencies in mRAG systems.

**Abstract:** Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the HalluEntity dataset for entity-level hallucination detection.
	2. Comprehensive evaluation of 17 modern LLMs using the proposed dataset.
	3. Insights into the relationships between linguistic properties and hallucination tendencies.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that uncertainty estimation methods focusing on individual token probabilities over-predict hallucinations, while context-aware methods perform better but still exhibit suboptimal results.

**Limitations:** The performance of context-aware methods is still suboptimal, indicating a need for better detection approaches.

**Conclusion:** The study identifies key relationships between hallucination tendencies and linguistic properties, providing important insights for future research directions.

**Abstract:** To mitigate the impact of hallucination nature of LLMs, many studies propose detecting hallucinated generation through uncertainty estimation. However, these approaches predominantly operate at the sentence or paragraph level, failing to pinpoint specific spans or entities responsible for hallucinated content. This lack of granularity is especially problematic for long-form outputs that mix accurate and fabricated information. To address this limitation, we explore entity-level hallucination detection. We propose a new data set, HalluEntity, which annotates hallucination at the entity level. Based on the dataset, we comprehensively evaluate uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches across 17 modern LLMs. Our experimental results show that uncertainty estimation approaches focusing on individual token probabilities tend to over-predict hallucinations, while context-aware methods show better but still suboptimal performance. Through an in-depth qualitative study, we identify relationships between hallucination tendencies and linguistic properties and highlight important directions for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Traditional recommender systems prioritize platform benefits over individual user preferences, leading to user vulnerabilities and lack of personalization.

**Method:** The proposed approach involves an agent that acts as a protective layer between the user and the recommender system, allowing for indirect exposure.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the user-agent-platform paradigm
	2. Improvement of user protection in recommender systems
	3. Focus on individual user preferences over platform objectives

**Result:** This paradigm aims to enhance user control and personalization while mitigating issues like manipulation and echo chambers.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm needs empirical validation in real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Adopting this user-agent-platform model can significantly improve user satisfaction and better align recommendations with individual needs.

**Abstract:** Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.

**Motivation:** To understand the patterns of text generation in LLMs through iterative processes, using dynamical systems theory as a framework.

**Method:** The study investigates the effects of successive paraphrasing in LLMs and explores the emergence of stable periodic states in generated outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of dynamical systems theory to the analysis of LLMs
	2. Identification of stabilization in paraphrasing leading to 2-period cycles
	3. Insights into constraints on linguistic diversity in LLM outputs

**Result:** The findings demonstrate that successive paraphrasing leads to convergence towards specific periodic states (2-period attractors), indicating a limitation in linguistic diversity despite expectations of diversity in LLM outputs.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on specific types of iterative processes and may not generalize to all aspects of language generation in LLMs.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights inherent constraints in the generative capabilities of LLMs and suggests using dynamical systems theory for studying the expressive potential of these models.

**Abstract:** Dynamical systems theory provides a framework for analyzing iterative processes and evolution over time. Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with increasing generation randomness or alternating prompts and LLMs. These findings underscore inherent constraints in LLM generative capability, while offering a novel dynamical systems perspective for studying their expressive potential.

**Motivation:** To address the inconsistencies in hyperparameter selection in studies assessing instruction tuning data quality for LLMs, which can lead to misleading conclusions about data effectiveness.

**Method:** The paper analyzes the variation in hyperparameters used across different studies for training the same model and conducts experiments on LIMA data and a selection of Alpaca data points to illustrate the consequences of arbitrary hyperparameter choices.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of the issue with arbitrary hyperparameter selection in instruction tuning studies.
	2. Experimental demonstration of the impact of hyperparameter decisions on model performance results.
	3. Emphasis on the need for rigorous methodology in evaluating IT data quality.

**Result:** The study shows that the arbitrary selection of hyperparameters can lead to significant variations in model performance, undermining the validity of conclusions drawn about instruction tuning data quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Careful consideration of hyperparameter choices is essential when evaluating the quality of instruction tuning data to maintain the integrity of alignment performance assessments for LLMs.

**Abstract:** Instruction tuning is crucial for adapting large language models (LLMs) to align with user intentions. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.

A few initiatives attempted to create open-source Bangla LLMs with performance still behind high-resource languages and limited reproducibility. To address this gap, we introduce TigerLLM - a family of Bangla LLMs. Our results demonstrate that these models surpass all open-source alternatives and also outperform larger proprietary models like GPT3.5 across standard benchmarks, establishing TigerLLM as the new baseline for future Bangla language modeling.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed KV cache management module, KVShare, enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM serving in multi-tenant environments without sacrificing model accuracy.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in long-text understanding have pushed the context length of large language models (LLMs) up to one million tokens. It boosts LLMs's accuracy and reasoning capacity but causes exorbitant computational costs and unsatisfactory Time to First Token (TTFT). KV cache reuse, which reuses the exact same KV cache of prefixes and templates or shares similar ones but with extra selective recomputation, offers a promising way to tackle this issue. However, prior studies overlook the cross-request KV reuse and the attention deviations introduced by new tokens during the decoding stage. In this paper, we present a KV cache management module that shares the KV cache across requests under multi-tenant scenarios without sacrificing model accuracy. Our system, KVShare, enables accurate and efficient LLM serving by 1) a Dual-Stage High Deviation algorithm (DHD) that conditionally selects a small portion of KV cache to be recomputed during both prefill and decode phases, and 2) a cache-aware scheduler that prioritizes requests based on their KV cache hit rates and orchestrates continuous batching to achieve enhanced system efficiency and faster TTFT. Multi-task experiments conducted on models such as Qwen2.5-7B,Llama3.1-8B and Yi1.5-9B demonstrate that KVShare reduces TTFT by up to 9.39x and increases 1.2x of the throughput compared to the full KV recompute. Moreover, KVShare achieves 20.38% boost in terms of accuracy compared to SOTA methods.

**Motivation:** To assess and improve the safety of DeepSeek-R1 models, which have shown critical vulnerabilities, especially in harmful prompt processing.

**Method:** The study utilizes the CHiSafetyBench, a comprehensive Chinese safety benchmark, to evaluate the safety capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 series models both before and after the distillation process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive evaluation of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models' safety in Chinese contexts

**Conclusion:** The study successfully enhances the safety of the DeepSeek-R1 model series, providing open-source access to improved models for future research and optimization.

**Abstract:** DeepSeek-R1, renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is significantly influencing the global artificial intelligence landscape. However, it exhibits notable safety shortcomings. Recent research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Furthermore, multiple security firms and research institutions have identified critical security vulnerabilities within the model. Although China Unicom has uncovered safety vulnerabilities of R1 in Chinese contexts, the safety capabilities of the remaining distilled models in the R1 series have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. To address this gap, this study utilizes the comprehensive Chinese safety benchmark CHiSafetyBench to conduct an in-depth safety evaluation of the DeepSeek-R1 series distilled models. The objective is to assess the safety capabilities of these models in Chinese contexts both before and after distillation, and to further elucidate the adverse effects of distillation on model safety. Building on these findings, we implement targeted safety enhancements for the entire DeepSeek-R1 model series. Evaluation results indicate that the enhanced models achieve significant improvements in safety while maintaining reasoning capabilities without notable degradation. We open-source the safety-enhanced models at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-R1-Safe to serve as a valuable resource for future research and optimization of DeepSeek models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need to improve the performance of large models using efficient fine-tuning techniques while addressing issues in MoE routing mechanisms.

**Method:** The proposed Mixture of Routers (MoR) uses multiple sub-routers for joint selection and a learnable main router to determine the weights of the sub-routers, enhancing the fine-tuning process.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Mixture of Routers (MoR) for fine-tuning.

**Result:** MoR outperforms baseline models on most tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of 1%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MoR offers a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suitable for a wide range of applications and serves as a plug-and-play solution.

**Abstract:** Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a milestone in aligning large language models with human instructions and adapting them to downstream tasks. In particular, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained widespread attention due to its parameter efficiency. However, its impact on improving the performance of large models remains limited. Recent studies suggest that combining LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can significantly enhance fine-tuning performance. MoE adapts to the diversity and complexity of datasets by dynamically selecting the most suitable experts, thereby improving task accuracy and efficiency. Despite impressive results, recent studies reveal issues in the MoE routing mechanism, such as incorrect assignments and imbalanced expert allocation. Inspired by the principles of Redundancy and Fault Tolerance Theory. We innovatively integrate the concept of Mixture of Experts into the routing mechanism and propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Mixture of Routers (MoR). It employs multiple sub-routers for joint selection and uses a learnable main router to determine the weights of the sub-routers. The results show that MoR outperforms baseline models on most tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of 1%. MoR can serve as a plug-and-play, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suitable for a wide range of applications. Our code is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoR-DFC6.

### [119] [Do Theory of Mind Benchmarks Need Explicit Human-like Reasoning in Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01698)

*Yi-Long Lu, Chunhui Zhang, Jiajun Song, Lifeng Fan, Wei Wang*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Theory of Mind, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Supervised Fine-Tuning, Natural Language Processing

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, revealing that larger models can improve reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), while smaller models face limitations. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) offers competitive performance without traditional reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand if LLM benchmarks for Theory of Mind require human-like reasoning or can succeed with alternative strategies.

**Method:** The study uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B parameters) and evaluates their performance on multiple ToM datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigated the distinct performance of LLMs under different training methodologies (RL vs. SFT) on ToM tasks.
	2. Demonstrated scale-dependent reasoning capabilities in LLMs, noting significant differences in model sizes.
	3. Highlighted the disconnection between benchmark performance and the reasoning process utilized by LLMs.

**Result:** Larger models (7B) showed improved accuracy and reasoning quality with RL, whereas smaller models (â¤3B) faced 'reasoning collapse'. SFT often matched or exceeded RL performance in terms of accuracy without explicit reasoning training.

**Limitations:** Study largely focused on specific LLM scales and might not generalize across all model architectures or tasks.

**Conclusion:** Current ToM benchmarks may not necessitate human-like reasoning; LLMs can achieve high accuracy through alternative methods, challenging the assumption that explicit belief-tracking is needed.

**Abstract:** Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, is fundamental for human social intelligence and a critical capability for advanced Artificial Intelligence. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on ToM benchmarks, raising the question: Do these benchmarks necessitate explicit human-like reasoning processes, or can models succeed through alternative strategies? We investigate this question empirically by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to LLMs of varying scales (0.5B to 7B parameters) and evaluating them across multiple ToM datasets. Our results reveal a scale-dependent impact of RL: while RL significantly improves accuracy and fosters high-quality, interpretable, and transferable belief-tracking reasoning in larger models (7B), it leads to "reasoning collapse" in smaller models ($\leq$3B), where high accuracy and generalization ability are achieved via drastically shortened, less meaningful responses. Surprisingly, further SFT achieves competitive and generalizable performance across these benchmarks, often matching or exceeding RL models in accuracy, despite not being explicitly trained to produce structured reasoning traces. These findings highlight a critical discrepancy between benchmark accuracy and the nature of learned reasoning. Our work suggests that current ToM benchmarks may be solvable without requiring the explicit, human-like simulation of mental states they were designed to probe. LLMs, particularly when scale is limited or training signals focus solely on output correctness, may leverage alternative rules effective for benchmark data structures.

**Keywords:** Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Semantic Diversity

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment (DRA) to improve reward signals in reinforcement learning for language models by incorporating semantic diversity in the learning process.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the limitation of standard reward signals in reinforcement learning that fail to capture semantic diversity, leading to diversity-quality inconsistencies.

**Method:** DRA employs Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to adjust rewards by downweighting redundant completions and enhancing rewards for diverse ones, integrated with both GRPO and its variant.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment (DRA) method
	2. Utilization of Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) for reward adjustment
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning tasks

**Result:** DRA demonstrates improved exploration and high-quality sample exploitation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks with an average accuracy of 58.2% using low resources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DRA improves the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for language model post-training by rewarding diversity, leading to better performance with limited training samples.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and $\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only 7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/DRA-GRPO.

We discuss the possibilities and limitations of using LLMs for text analysis.

**Conclusion:** The authors believe this framework offers valuable insights into watermarking strategies for AI-generated text, potentially enhancing the security and accountability of LLM outputs.

**Abstract:** The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution. Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel insights into diverse watermarking paradigms. Our code is available at https://github.com/redwyd/SymMark.

**Keywords:** semantic text representation, interpretable embeddings, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Low-dimensional Dense and Interpretable text embeddings (LDIR) that offer semantic representation and interpretability, outperforming traditional methods with fewer dimensions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current text embeddings struggle with interpretability despite effective performance, prompting the need for more interpretable yet efficient solutions.

**Method:** The authors propose a new approach that generates low-dimensional (under 500) embeddings using farthest point sampling to maintain semantic relatedness to anchor texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Low-dimensional Dense and Interpretable (LDIR) embeddings.
	2. Validation of LDIR on multiple tasks demonstrating superior performance with fewer dimensions.
	3. Code availability for further research and validation.

**Result:** LDIR shows performance close to black-box models while outperforming existing interpretable embeddings with significantly fewer dimensions, validated across various tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LDIR provides a compelling balance between performance and interpretability in semantic text representations.

**Abstract:** Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024) propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms "0/1" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than 10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability. We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings baselines with much fewer dimensions.
