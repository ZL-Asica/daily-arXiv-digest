  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore factors motivating people to assist chatbots, addressing the gap in research concerning human support for chatbot performance and collaborative outcomes.

**Method:** An online experiment with 244 participants where chatbots made mistakes during a collaborative image labeling task, followed by measurement of participants' prosocial behaviors and intentions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examined the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on human empathy and prosocial behavior.
	2. Identified empathy and perception of human-like qualities as motivators for prosocial actions toward chatbots.
	3. Provided insights into improving chatbot designs to enhance user engagement.

**Result:** Human identity and emotional expression in chatbots significantly increased prosocial behaviors and intentions in participants, with empathy serving as a mediating factor.

**Limitations:** Potential limitations include the artificial nature of the experimental task and the specific context of chatbot interactions.

**Conclusion:** Understanding the role of empathy and chatbots' human-like features can help promote positive human interactions with chatbots, thereby improving chatbot performance and acceptance.

**Abstract:** Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However, little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots. To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

### [2] ["TikTok, Do Your Thing": User Reactions to Social Surveillance in the Public Sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20884)

*Meira Gilbert, Miranda Wei, Lindah Kotut*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** TikTok, interpersonal surveillance, social media trends, privacy, community engagement

**Relevance Score:** 5

**TL;DR:** Analysis of TikTok's "Do Your Thing" trend reveals user support for surveillance-based identification of strangers, raising concerns about privacy and social norms.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore user reactions to the viral TikTok trend where individuals identify strangers in public through crowd-sourced information.

**Method:** Conducted a qualitative analysis of 60 TikTok videos and 1,901 user comments to capture reactions and sentiments toward the trend.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Qualitative insights into user engagement with surveillance trends on social media
	2. New perspective on interpersonal surveillance and community dynamics
	3. Discussion of social implications concerning privacy and consent

**Result:** Identified 19 successful identifications among the videos; supportive comments (n=883) outnumbered disapproving comments (n=310), indicating a complex social engagement with the trend.

**Limitations:** Limited to analysis of TikTok content and may not generalize to other platforms or contexts.

**Conclusion:** Highlights the normalization of interpersonal surveillance and its implications on consent, relationships, and societal norms around privacy.

**Abstract:** ''TikTok, Do Your Thing'' is a viral trend where users attempt to identify strangers they see in public via information crowd-sourcing. The trend started as early as 2021 and users typically engage with it for romantic purposes (similar to a ''Missed Connections'' personal advertisement). This practice includes acts of surveillance and identification in the public sphere, although by peers rather than governments or corporations. To understand users' reactions to this trend we conducted a qualitative analysis of 60 TikTok videos and 1,901 user comments. Of the 60 videos reviewed, we find 19 individuals were successfully identified. We also find that while there were comments expressing disapproval (n=310), more than double the number expressed support (n=883). Supportive comments demonstrated genuine interest and empathy, reflecting evolving conceptions of community and algorithmic engagement. On the other hand, disapproving comments highlighted concerns about inappropriate relationships, stalking, consent, and gendered double standards. We discuss these insights in relation to the normalization of interpersonal surveillance, online stalking, and as an evolution of social surveillance to offer a new perspective on user perceptions surrounding interpersonal surveillance and identification in the public sphere.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** haptic feedback, virtual reality, crowd simulation, collision avoidance, user behavior

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This study examines the impact of haptic feedback on user behavior during human crowd simulation in virtual reality, revealing enhanced collision avoidance and user awareness.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how haptic feedback affects walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows in virtual reality, particularly in scenarios such as emergency evacuation training.

**Method:** A user study was conducted where participants experienced crowded pedestrian flows in VR with and without haptic feedback to measure changes in walking motion and collision avoidance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the impact of haptic feedback on collision avoidance in VR environments.
	2. Showed increased user awareness and exploration in crowded pedestrian flows due to haptic stimuli.
	3. Provided empirical data on the changes in walking dynamics such as trajectory length and pelvis angle in response to feedback.

**Result:** Haptic feedback significantly altered user walking trajectories, increased awareness, and enhanced visual exploration during interactions with non-player characters, resulting in greater sensitivity to potential collisions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that haptic feedback can improve user experiences in VR by enhancing their awareness of and responsiveness to their environment in crowded scenarios.

**Abstract:** Human crowd simulation in virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool with potential applications including emergency evacuation training and assessment of building layout. While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience, its effect on walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that haptic feedback changed users' collision avoidance movements, as measured by increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The displacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC), even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced users' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side and back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic feedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users' sensitivity to a collision in VR environment.

**Keywords:** subtitles, accessibility, Aphasia, media research, inclusive design

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper discusses the need for personalized subtitle options to enhance accessibility for individuals with Aphasia, advocating for inclusive practices in media research and system design.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current subtitle options are not adequately addressing the diverse accessibility needs, especially for people with Aphasia.

**Method:** The paper advocates for the inclusion of thoughts and opinions from people with Aphasia in media research to inform the design of more effective media solutions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Emphasizes the need for personalization in subtitle accessibility for people with Aphasia.
	2. Highlights the importance of user feedback in designing media solutions.
	3. Proposes the development of prototyping tools for equitable inclusion in design processes.

**Result:** The findings highlight the necessity of personalized approaches to subtitle consumption and the importance of equitable inclusion in design processes.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Adapting subtitles to individual contexts will create a more inclusive media viewing experience for individuals with Aphasia.

**Abstract:** The consumption of subtitles via TVs, laptops and smartphones has the potential to marginalize people based on their complex accessibility needs. The current one-size-fits-all approach to this accessibility aid is no longer fit for purpose and work is required to look at how it can be adapted to be personalised for individual users based on individual context, content, and consumption habits. People with Aphasia, for example, encounter significant challenges in understanding subtitle texts.   We see our work as a call to action for more inclusive practices, focusing on how the thoughts and opinions of people with aphasia can be included in media research. Our work investigates how to develop future media solutions for people with aphasia to create a more inclusive media viewing environment. We believe the key to this is appropriate prototyping tools and methods to allow equitable inclusion in the system design process.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for effective data communication through visualizations, which currently rely on complex data-to-visual mapping that existing multimodal models struggle to decode.

**Method:** A dataset combining chart images with vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features was created, and multimodal LLMs were trained to improve understanding and accuracy in data extraction and chart reconstruction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a novel dataset for multimodal visualization LLMs

	3. Demonstrated improvements in accuracy and reconstruction quality

**Result:** The proposed approach shows significant improvements in data extraction accuracy and chart reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address the scalability of the method to different types of visualizations or domains.

**Conclusion:** The novel dataset and training method for multimodal visualization LLMs enhance understanding of visualizations, addressing key challenges in decoding and accurately reconstructing them.

**Abstract:** Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart reconstruction quality.

### [7] ["Who Should I Believe?": User Interpretation and Decision-Making When a Family Healthcare Robot Contradicts Human Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21322)

*Hong Wang, Natalia Calvo-Barajas, Katie Winkle, Ginevra Castellano*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** robot transparency, user trust, healthcare robotics, decision-making, sociability

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The study explores how robot transparency and sociability affect user trust and decision-making when contradictory information is presented, highlighting the risks of overtrust in healthcare robotics.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of robotic transparency on user decision-making and trust in scenarios where robots provide conflicting information.

**Method:** A 2 x 2 between-subjects online study with 176 participants observing a Furhat robot in a healthcare setting, focusing on its level of transparency and sociability.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examined the effects of robot transparency on user decision-making
	2. Showed tendencies of overtrust in robot recommendations
	3. Highlighted importance of transparency in healthcare robots' design

**Result:** Results showed that higher transparency led to fewer misinterpretations of conflicting information, with users tending to overtrust low transparency robots and prioritize their recommendations over personal memory.

**Limitations:** The study's scenario was based on a fictional context and may not fully represent real-world dynamics in healthcare settings.

**Conclusion:** Transparency mechanisms in robotic systems are crucial to prevent overreliance in healthcare, and understanding these dynamics is essential for effective multi-user robot deployments in home settings.

**Abstract:** Advancements in robotic capabilities for providing physical assistance, psychological support, and daily health management are making the deployment of intelligent healthcare robots in home environments increasingly feasible in the near future. However, challenges arise when the information provided by these robots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and decision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a robot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation, decision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information from a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and suggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that remembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced users' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency robot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly remembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were more likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner or another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally, participants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the robot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system malfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact of transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance associated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home environments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in sensitive domains such as healthcare.

**Conclusion:** High user control and proactive, context-aware systems foster better collaboration and creative outcomes, but gaps in supporting early creative phases and user adaptation remain.

**Abstract:** The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity. Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task, proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive, can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations, highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust. Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to user adaptation to AI systems.

**TL;DR:** A lightweight, wearable fingertip haptic device provides physics-based feedback for better dexterous manipulation in virtual environments without impacting real-world interactions.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a haptic device that enhances virtual manipulation while maintaining a lightweight and non-intrusive design.

**Method:** The device uses thin strings and actuators attached to fingernails, integrating with a physics engine to produce various haptic feedback types. Performance was evaluated through user tests measuring pressure perception and manipulation tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a wearable device that enhances virtual manipulation
	2. Demonstrated the effectiveness of minimal haptic feedback
	3. Showcased a solution for daily wearability with preserved tactile sensations

**Result:** Participants effectively perceived pressure and vibration feedback, leading to improved efficiency in virtual tasks due to the minimal haptic cues provided by the device.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The fingertip haptic device successfully balances lightweight construction with efficient haptic feedback, presenting an innovative alternative to traditional glove-type haptic devices.

**Abstract:** This study presents a lightweight, wearable fingertip haptic device that provides physics-based haptic feedback for dexterous manipulation in virtual environments without hindering real-world interactions. The device, designed with thin strings and actuators attached to the fingernails, ensures minimal weight (1.55 g per finger) and preserves finger flexibility. Integrating the software with a physics engine renders multiple types of haptic feedback (grip force, collision, and sliding vibration feedback). We evaluated the device's performance in pressure perception, slip feedback, typical dexterous manipulation tasks, and daily operations, and we gathered user experience through subjective assessments. Our results show that participants could perceive and respond to pressure and vibration feedback. Through dexterous manipulation experiments, we further demonstrated that these minimal haptic cues significantly improved virtual task efficiency, showcasing how lightweight haptic feedback can enhance manipulation performance without complex mechanisms. The device's ability to preserve tactile sensations and minimize hindrance to real-world operations is a key advantage over glove-type haptic devices. This research offers a potential solution for designing haptic interfaces that balance lightweight construction, haptic feedback for dexterous manipulation, and daily wearability.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** virtual environments, user study, head-mounted displays, level of detail, search task

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a design paradigm for managing detail in virtual environments and conducts a user study to evaluate high detail insets in head-mounted displays.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the design of systems that manage level of detail in virtual environments.

**Method:** A user study involving ten subjects was conducted to assess the effectiveness of different display setups, specifically through varying inset size and peripheral detail while controlling for other factors.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a new design paradigm for managing detail in virtual environments.
	2. Conducted a user study with various display settings to evaluate effectiveness of high detail insets.
	3. Identified that insetless displays can perform similarly to inset displays under certain conditions.

**Result:** ANOVAs indicated that insetless, high detail displays did not significantly impact search times or accuracies as compared to displays with insets, with only the insetless, low detail display showing significant results.

**Limitations:** The study does not explore varying task complexities beyond a simple search task.

**Conclusion:** Further research will explore the impact of task complexity, inset size, and level of detail.

**Abstract:** A paradigm for the design of systems that manage level of detail in virtual environments is proposed. As an example of the prototyping step in this paradigm, a user study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of high detail insets used with head-mounted displays. Ten subjects were given a simple search task that required the location and identification of a single target object. All subjects used seven different displays (the independent variable), varying in inset size and peripheral detail, to perform this task. Frame rate, target location, subject input method, and order of display use were all controlled. Primary dependent measures were search time on trials with correct identification, and the percentage of all trials correctly identified. ANOVAs of the results showed that insetless, high detail displays did not lead to significantly different search times or accuracies than displays with insets. In fact, only the insetless, low detail display returned significantly different results. Further research is being performed to examine the effect of varying task complexity, inset size, and level of detail.

### [11] [Managing level of detail through head-tracked peripheral degradation: a model and resulting design principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21456)

*Benjamin Watson, Neff Walker, Larry F Hodges*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** peripheral vision, display degradation, search performance

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a model for understanding the effectiveness of peripheral detail degradation in displays based on an eye/head movement tradeoff, along with experimental results on its implications for display design.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how reductions in the level of detail (LOD) in peripheral vision of head-tracked large displays can affect user performance.

**Method:** A psychophysically based model was developed along with an experiment to evaluate search performance in displays with varied central area shapes and sizes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Developed a psychophysical model for peripheral display degradation.
	2. Evaluated the impact of inset area and shape on search performance in large displays.
	3. Provided design recommendations for effective peripherally degraded displays.

**Result:** It was found that while the shape of the high detail central area (inset) does not significantly affect performance, the size is critical—displays with at least 30 degrees of inset area performed comparably to undegraded displays.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support the proposed model, indicating that while shape is less important, inset area plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of peripherally degraded displays.

**Abstract:** Previous work has demonstrated the utility of reductions in the level of detail (LOD) in the periphery of head-tracked, large field of view displays. This paper provides a psychophysically based model, centered around an eye/head movement tradeoff, that explains the effectiveness of peripheral degradation and suggests how peripherally degraded displays should be designed. An experiment evaluating the effect on search performance of the shape and area of the high detail central area (inset) in peripherally degraded displays was performed, results indicated that inset shape is not a significant factor in performance. Inset area, however, was significant: performance with displays subtending at least 30 degrees of horizontal and vertical angle was not significantly different from performance with an undegraded display. These results agreed with the proposed model.

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** apologies, LLM-based chatbots, moral agency, linguistic agency, ethics

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** This paper critiques the nature of apologies generated by LLM-based chatbots, arguing that such apologies lack true moral agency and linguistic competency.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the implications of LLM-based chatbots producing apologies and the inherent limitations of their moral and linguistic agency.

**Method:** The paper analyzes the characteristics of genuine apologies and contrasts them with the output of chatbots, assessing the necessary moral and linguistic agency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critique of LLM-based chatbots' ability to produce authentic apologies
	2. Discussion on moral and linguistic agency in the context of AI
	3. Implications for chatbot design and ethical considerations

**Result:** It argues that chatbot apologies are inauthentic and do not fulfill the essential role of genuine apologies, leading to critical reflections on chatbot design and ethics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The authors emphasize the need to rethink chatbot behavior regarding apologies and propose considerations for ethical AI design.

**Abstract:** Apologies serve essential functions for moral agents such as expressing remorse, taking responsibility, and repairing trust. LLM-based chatbots routinely produce output that has the linguistic form of an apology. However, they do this simply because they are echoing the kinds of things that humans say. Moreover, there are reasons to think that chatbots are not the kind of linguistic or moral agents capable of apology. To put the point bluntly: Chatbot apologies are bullshit. This paper explores this concern and develops it beyond the epithet, drawing on the nature of morally serious apologies, the linguistic agency required to perform them, and the moral agency required for them to matter. We conclude by considering some consequences for how chatbots should be designed and how we ought to think about them.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current QA systems struggle with probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty, which this paper aims to address.

**Method:** The framework induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and utilizes LLMs for answer generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the LUCARIO benchmark for probabilistic QA
	2. Development of a framework using Bayesian Networks for reasoning
	3. Application of LLMs for generating answers from probabilistic queries.

**Result:** Empirical results show significant improvements over baseline approaches in tackling probabilistic questions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning in probabilistic QA.

**Abstract:** Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data. Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [14] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)

*Victor Ojewale, Inioluwa Deborah Raji, Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** multi-lingual benchmarks, large language models, NLP, functional evaluation, model robustness

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces multi-lingual functional benchmarks to evaluate large language models, revealing significant performance inconsistencies across languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the evaluation of multi-lingual competence in large language models beyond static benchmarks, which may not accurately reflect practical performance.

**Method:** The authors created two new functional benchmarks—CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval—by translating existing English benchmark templates into French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Yoruba.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval benchmarks for multi-lingual evaluation
	2. Revealed performance discrepancies in existing benchmarks
	3. Highlighted robustness variation across different languages

**Result:** The study found marked performance drops in some language pairs when comparing static benchmarks to the created functional benchmarks, indicating that not all benchmarks are effective for multi-lingual evaluation.

**Limitations:** Does not explore the reasons behind the performance discrepancies across languages; may not cover languages beyond those studied.

**Conclusion:** The performance and robustness of models vary significantly across languages, suggesting that certain languages are better supported in multi-lingual settings, which can guide future NLP research.

**Abstract:** Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English) being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, research outcomes, ideation-execution gap, NLP, evaluation metrics

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This study compares the effectiveness of research ideas generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and human experts in an execution context to assess their impact on research outcomes.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The goal is to evaluate whether LLM-generated research ideas lead to better research results compared to those generated by human experts, addressing the limitations of LLMs in generating effective research concepts.

**Method:** Forty-three expert researchers executed randomly-assigned ideas generated by either LLMs or human experts, spending over 100 hours each and documenting their experiments in a 4-page paper. The outcomes were then reviewed blind by NLP experts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the decrease in quality of LLM-generated ideas after execution compared to human-generated ideas.
	2. Highlighted the limitations of LLMs in producing effective research ideas.
	3. Provided a framework for evaluating the impact of research idea generation on actual research outcomes.

**Result:** LLM-generated ideas received significantly lower review scores post-execution compared to expert ideas across several evaluation metrics, indicating a significant drop in perceived novelty and effectiveness of LLM ideas.

**Limitations:** The study may be limited by the small sample size of expert researchers and specific evaluation criteria used for review.

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal a notable ideation-execution gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle to generate truly effective research ideas, raising challenges in evaluating creativity without execution outcomes.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should also result in better research after being executed. To test whether AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas, either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100 hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas in the absence of execution outcomes.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** financial documents, multimodal reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** MultiFinRAG enhances financial question answering by integrating multimodal content, achieving higher accuracy in complex tasks than traditional LLMs.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the challenges of answering questions over extensive financial documents that blend text, tables, and images, which strain existing LLMs and RAG frameworks.

**Method:** MultiFinRAG utilizes multimodal extraction, batching table and figure images, and employing a lightweight multimodal LLM to generate structured JSON outputs and summaries. It incorporates a tiered fallback strategy for cross-modal reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MultiFinRAG framework for financial QA
	2. Implementation of multimodal extraction and dynamic context escalation
	3. Enhanced accuracy on financial QA tasks compared to traditional models

**Result:** Achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o on financial QA tasks involving various modalities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** MultiFinRAG can effectively manage complex multimodal inputs in financial documents, demonstrating improved performance on relevant QA tasks.

**Abstract:** Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates LLMs on their ability to respond to everyday conflict scenarios, revealing biases in violent content generation based on demographic factors.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate how LLMs respond to morally ambiguous scenarios and assess their ability to handle conflict without bias.

**Method:** Utilized the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ) to evaluate six LLMs, incorporating persona-based prompts that varied race, age, and geographic identity.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First study applying VBVQ to LLMs
	2. Demonstrated demographic bias in LLM responses to violent scenarios
	3. Highlighted discrepancies between LLM outputs and established social science research

**Result:** The study found that LLMs often produce surface-level text that contradicts their internal preferences for violent responses, and these tendencies vary across different demographic groups.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to six LLMs and may not generalize to all LLMs or contexts outside the U.S.

**Conclusion:** LLMs reveal biases in violent content generation that may contradict established social science findings, highlighting the need for careful evaluation before deploying them in conflict-sensitive applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the challenges of using automated fact-checking systems in medicine, focusing on how clinical experts verify claims from social media.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the complexities of verifying health-related claims against medical literature and understand why existing fact-checking systems are underused in medicine.

**Method:** The study involves analyzing how clinical experts synthesize medical evidence to verify real claims sourced from social media.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First study examining expert verification of claims from social media in a medical context
	2. Identification of key challenges faced by fact-checkers in the medical field
	3. Proposal to redefine fact-checking as an interactive communication problem

**Result:** The analysis reveals significant challenges such as linking real-world claims to clinical trial evidence, ambiguities in claims, and subjective nature of veracity labels.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on clinical expert responses and may not reflect the perspectives of other stakeholders in the health informatics field.

**Conclusion:** Fact-checking in medicine should be treated as an interactive communication issue instead of a straightforward end-to-end process.

**Abstract:** Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence. In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials; ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than an end-to-end process.

**Motivation:** Language models face challenges in adapting to specific tasks due to inefficient use of unlabeled data, overfitting from limited labeled data, and high computational costs.

**Method:** The thesis introduces novel techniques including continued pre-training with unlabeled data, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, and improved supervised fine-tuning methods, alongside new evaluation benchmarks for language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel continued pre-training technique for task-relevant knowledge extraction
	2. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method

**Result:** Empirical studies show significant improvements in language model robustness, efficiency, and generalization across various NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The advances presented contribute towards more capable and adaptable language models, enhancing their utility in a broad range of applications, pushing closer to artificial general intelligence.

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging. As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world language tasks.   This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation. Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more comprehensively.   Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a new pipeline for curating multilingual datasets for pre-training large language models (LLMs), demonstrating improved performance for non-English models and introducing FineWeb2, a substantial multilingual dataset.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address challenges in creating performant multilingual LLMs due to the complexity of dataset curation across different languages.

**Method:** The authors introduce a dataset curation pipeline adaptable to any language, demonstrated through ablation studies on nine languages and guided by evaluation tasks chosen via measurable criteria.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an adaptable multilingual dataset curation pipeline
	2. Demonstration of improved model performance on non-English corpora
	3. Release of a 20 terabyte multilingual dataset (FineWeb2) along with training and evaluation tools.

**Result:** The proposed pipeline produces non-English corpora that yield more performant models than previous datasets, and a rebalancing approach enhances performance further.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The FineWeb2 dataset and the curation pipeline enable the effective training of multilingual models at scale, releasing tools and datasets to the community.

**Abstract:** Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift. Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document) multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and evaluation codebases.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B parameters.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a method for meta-training language models (LMs) so that gradient updates mimic the effects of prompting instead of standard fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 14 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional fine-tuning in language models, particularly in incorporating new information effectively and improving generalization.

**Method:** The approach employs gradient-based meta-learning techniques where the LM's own prompted predictions serve as targets, avoiding the need for ground-truth labels.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A novel method for meta-training LMs that emulates prompting through gradient updates.
	2. Empirical evidence showing improvement on challenging language model tasks.
	3. Insights into the generalization capabilities of gradient-based learning in the context of LMs.

**Result:** The method demonstrates significant improvements in tasks related to the 'reversal curse' and allows LMs to answer questions based on text passages after a single gradient update.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that gradient descent, with proper initialization, can enhance the expressive capabilities of LMs, leading to better performance in long-context modeling and heightened generalization.

**Abstract:** There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of gradient-based learning.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an advanced method for modeling large language model (LLM) personalities, addressing limitations of existing personality frameworks and enabling nuanced control over personality traits.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the growing expectation for LLMs to exhibit human-like personalities, which current models inadequately fulfill due to reliance on coarse personality dimensions and lack of trait intensity control.

**Method:** The authors extend the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) using the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model and introduce the Specific Attribute Control (SAC) framework to evaluate and dynamically induce trait intensity in LLMs through semantic anchoring and behavioral questions.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Incorporation of the 16PF model for enhanced personality trait granularity
	2. Development of the Specific Attribute Control (SAC) framework for trait intensity modulation
	3. Establishment of a continuous spectrum for personality traits leading to coherent behavioral responses

**Result:** The proposed method allows for a continuous spectrum of personality trait intensity, yielding more consistent expression and demonstrating that changes in target intensity influence related traits in coherent psychological ways.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This research enhances human-machine interactions in various fields and moves closer to the development of socially intelligent machines.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors: \textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and \textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

**Result:** Evaluation results showed that Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o performed best, but challenges persisted in numerical computations and legal interpretations.

**Limitations:** The dataset is based solely on Chartered Accountancy exams and may not cover all financial scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The strengths and limitations of LLMs were identified, suggesting improvements through hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation methods.

**Abstract:** Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context, this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1 405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis and accurate legal interpretation.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** Proposes a Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF) for e-commerce query classification that effectively combines multiple tasks to improve efficiency and performance.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** E-commerce queries are typically short and lack context, leading to challenges in intent and category prediction; existing methods are inefficient due to reliance on user behavior and lack of a unified framework.

**Method:** Introduces SSUF, which includes knowledge-enhanced, label-enhanced, and structure-enhanced modules to address inefficiencies in query classification by unifying tasks and leveraging unlabelled data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF)
	2. Introduction of knowledge-enhanced, label-enhanced, and structure-enhanced modules
	3. Demonstrated superiority over existing query classification methods in A/B tests

**Result:** SSUF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both offline and online A/B experiments, providing improved query representations and reducing dependence on posterior labels.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The SSUF framework, with its modular design, can adapt to various subtask needs and enhances the effectiveness of e-commerce query classification.

**Abstract:** Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used, resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle. Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework, leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.   In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates the potential of LLM-CRAN and MT2-CSD in advancing the field of conversational stance detection.

**Abstract:** In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN), which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of conversational stance detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address cross-modal misalignment bias and intra-modal semantic divergence that degrade sentence representation quality in multimodal approaches.

**Method:** DALR employs a consistency learning module for softening negative samples and utilizes an auxiliary task for semantic similarity, combining it with ranking distillation and global intra-modal alignment learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DALR for dual-level alignment in sentence representation
	2. Utilization of consistency learning for fine-grained cross-modal alignment
	3. Integration of ranking distillation with global intra-modal alignment learning

**Result:** Experiments on STS and TR tasks show DALR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sentence representation quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed methods effectively enhance multimodal sentence representations and provide a deeper understanding of sentence relationships beyond binary labels.

**Abstract:** Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR (Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Progtuning framework not only optimizes resource usage but also shows adaptability with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, performing well across different adaptation scenarios.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of autoregressive language models in terms of slow decoding and global coherence in text generation.

**Method:** Cosmos operates in a compressed, smooth latent space learned through an autoencoder, enabling effective perturbation-based augmentations for text generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a compressed latent space for text generation
	2. Demonstration of $2\times$ faster inference compared to existing models
	3. Evaluation across four diverse generative tasks with superior or comparable quality.

**Result:** Cosmos can compress text representations by $8\times$ while maintaining comparable generation quality to token-level diffusion models, and it achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Cosmos can surpass existing diffusion-based and autoregressive models in various generative tasks, demonstrating superior efficiency and quality.

**Abstract:** Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control; however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

**Motivation:** To enhance turn-taking prediction in spoken dialogue systems by enabling intuitive control through textual prompts, adapting to various conversational contexts.

**Method:** A transformer-based voice activity projection model was developed, integrating textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise and cross-channel transformers. The model was trained and evaluated using 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data, supplemented by synthetic prompt sentences generated by a large language model.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced dynamic control of turn-taking prediction using textual prompts
	2. Enhanced transformer model architecture for dialogue systems
	3. Utilized synthetic data generation from LLM to overcome dataset limitations

**Result:** The model showed improved prediction accuracy and successfully varied turn-taking behaviors in response to different textual prompts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the novel approach.

**Limitations:** The model relies on the availability of effective textual prompts and performance may vary with different conversational contexts not covered in the training data.

**Conclusion:** The proposed model represents a significant advancement in the field of spoken dialogue systems, allowing for flexible and context-aware turn-taking prediction based on user instructions.

**Abstract:** Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a retrieval-based prompting strategy for ATE
	2. Demonstration of improved performance using syntactic retrieval

**Conclusion:** The results underscore the significance of syntactic cues in leveraging LLMs for terminology extraction tasks.

**Abstract:** Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting, selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance. Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

**Motivation:** Multimodal agents face challenges in self-correction and generalization due to a lack of external feedback. Effective reward modeling is critical for their success in real-world tasks.

**Method:** The authors developed Agent-RewardBench, which evaluates reward modeling capabilities in MLLMs across three dimensions: real-world scenarios, step-level reward evaluations, and quality control through rigorous sampling and verification processes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a benchmark specifically for assessing reward modeling in multimodal agents.
	2. Incorporation of multiple dimensions and real-world scenarios in the evaluation framework.
	3. Step-level reward assessment to gain insights into individual task performance.

**Result:** Experiments show that even the best existing multimodal models perform poorly, indicating the necessity of specialized training for reward modeling in agents.

**Limitations:** The benchmark may still be limited by the existing capabilities of current multimodal models and the inherent complexity of real-world tasks.

**Conclusion:** Agent-RewardBench provides a significant tool for understanding and improving reward modeling in MLLMs, underscoring the current deficiencies in agent performance.

**Abstract:** As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence. However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at github.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether the ability of LLMs to deceive detection methods may plateau as models grow in size and complexity.

**Method:** Statistical classifiers were utilized to assess their ability to identify artificially generated text, comparing performances across different versions of language models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of fake text detection in classical detective fiction style
	2. Comparison of LLM performance (Gemini vs GPT) in text generation
	3. Analysis of the potential plateau in detection capabilities of LLMs

**Result:** Gemini showed increased proficiency in generating deceptive text with a version increase, whereas GPT did not exhibit similar improvements, indicating that detection methods may persist in reliability.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to specific styles of text (detective fiction) and may not generalize to other genres or applications.

**Conclusion:** Reliable detection of fake text could continue to be feasible, despite advancements in model architecture and parameter sizes, implying a possible limit to how deceptive models can become.

**Abstract:** Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5 version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model architectures may improve their deceptiveness

**Conclusion:** Double-Checker offers a promising approach for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs through structured self-critique.

**Abstract:** While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of ungrounded speculation by LLMs when context without sufficient information is provided, ensuring factual consistency in responses.

**Method:** The study employs lightweight encoder models like RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, for groundedness detection before generating answers.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a lightweight groundedness detection mechanism
	2. Demonstration of encoder models achieving high accuracy
	3. Reduction of inference time and resource consumption in LLMs

**Result:** The proposed detection mechanism achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art LLMs while significantly reducing inference latency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Improving groundedness detection can lead to more trustworthy and resource-efficient applications of LLMs in NLP tasks.

**Abstract:** Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge. Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

### [40] [Detecting Referring Expressions in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21294)

*Bram Willemsen, Gabriel Skantze*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** referring expressions, visually grounded dialogue, large language model

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the extraction of referring expressions from visually grounded dialogues using a text-only autoregressive language model.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how linguistic context can aid in detecting mentions that have visually perceivable referents in dialogue.

**Method:** Adaptation of a pretrained large language model to perform coarse-grained annotation of mention spans in dialogues by utilizing next-token prediction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated effectiveness of LLM in text-only mention extraction
	2. Highlighted linguistic context's importance for referring expressions
	3. Discussed the limitations of using unimodal approaches for a multimodal task

**Result:** The text-only approach was found to be effective in extracting referring expressions even with moderate LLMs and limited datasets, emphasizing the importance of linguistic cues.

**Limitations:** The task is inherently multimodal, indicating limitations of unimodal approaches.

**Conclusion:** While the results are promising, the task remains fundamentally multimodal which presents limitations for unimodal approaches.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM, relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental to unimodal approaches.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents Omni-RAG, a framework to enhance retrieval-augmented generation systems' performance in handling complex, noisy user queries.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current RAG systems struggle with noisy, ambiguous, and multiple-intent user queries, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.

**Method:** Omni-RAG consists of three modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding for query denoising and decomposition, (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval to retrieve and aggregate responses for sub-queries, and (3) Reranking and Generation to refine document selection before generating the final response with an LLM.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a comprehensive framework for RAG systems
	2. Modules for query understanding and intent-aware retrieval are proposed
	3. Demonstrates improvements in handling noisy and multi-intent queries

**Result:** Omni-RAG shows improved robustness and effectiveness in live, open-domain settings by adequately handling complex queries compared to current RAG systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework bridges the gap between RAG capabilities and real-world application demands, making it suitable for challenges presented in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

**Abstract:** Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus (i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex and noisy queries.

**Keywords:** Domain Knowledge, Deceptive Conversations, Concept Drift, NLP, Large Language Models

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLM framework to detect deceptive conversations and concept drift in NLP applications, improving accuracy and interpretability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the detection of deceptive conversations and combat concept drift in dynamic language contexts, where traditional methods struggle due to evolving patterns and ambiguity.

**Method:** The framework integrates pretrained LLMs with domain-specific insights and consists of a DK-LLM module for deception detection, a drift detection unit to identify semantic shifts, and another DK-LLM module for classifying the nature of the drift.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a DK-Enhanced LLM framework for detecting deceptive conversations.
	2. Validation of the framework using a multiturn dialogue dataset and a fake review dataset.
	3. Demonstration of significant performance improvements and robustness in NLP applications.

**Result:** The proposed architecture achieved 98% classification accuracy in detecting fake conversations and classifying drift, outperforming zero-shot baselines, demonstrating improved interpretability and robustness in NLP tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly boosts performance in high-stakes NLP applications, effectively addressing challenges of ambiguity and evolving language patterns.

**Abstract:** Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)\-i.e., semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue, making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk\-sensitive scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)\-Enhanced LLM framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task\-specific insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK\-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK\-LLM module to classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA\-based implementation achieves 98\% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero\-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in high\-stakes NLP applications.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of evaluation in languages other than English for database query generation through large language models.

**Method:** The paper creates a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish, evaluating several foundational models using standardized prompts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of a multilingual test set for Text2Cypher task
	2. Evaluation of foundational models across multiple languages
	3. Insights into the impact of task prompt translation on performance

**Result:** The study finds highest performance on English, moderate on Spanish, and lowest on Turkish, attributed to training data availability and linguistic features.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to three languages (English, Spanish, Turkish) and focused mainly on foundational models without exploring advanced models.

**Conclusion:** The research emphasizes the need for inclusive evaluation in multilingual query generation and suggests future exploration of schema localization and fine-tuning in diverse languages.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and linguistic characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and fine-tuning across diverse languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve spoken dialogue systems, which face challenges due to the complexities of real-time speech interactions that current methods do not address.

**Method:** A novel preference alignment framework is employed, utilizing a dataset of over 150,000 annotated preference pairs derived from multi-turn speech conversations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a large-scale annotated dataset with 150,000 preference pairs for real-time dialogues.
	2. Introduction of a preference alignment framework tailored for spoken dialogue systems.
	3. Demonstration of significant improvements in spoken dialogue quality through human evaluation.

**Result:** Results show that finetuning the speech-to-speech model with user feedback leads to improvements in generative quality, factual accuracy, and contextual relevance in spoken dialogue.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the significance of balancing diverse interaction dynamics for effective real-time speech dialogue systems.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions, with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than 150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.

**Keywords:** sparse autoencoders, transformer architecture, TopK activation, interoperability, language models

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces TopK LMs, a modification to transformer architecture using a TopK activation function, enhancing interpretability while addressing limitations of traditional sparse autoencoders (SAEs).

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the utility of sparse autoencoders in analyzing transformer-based language model activations, their post-hoc training raises questions about internal validity and concept representation. This paper seeks to improve interpretability and stability in understanding how language models learn concepts.

**Method:** The authors propose a modification to the transformer architecture that integrates a TopK activation function, allowing hidden states to serve as latent features without the need for post-hoc training. This facilitates enhanced interpretability and stability across different model checkpoints.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of TopK LMs that enhance interpretability without post-hoc training.
	2. Demonstration of stable sparse representations across model checkpoints.
	3. Enablement of neuron intervention techniques for analysis of language models.

**Result:** The results indicate that TopK LMs provide effective and interpretable sparse representations, enabling targeted neuron interventions and detailed comparative analysis of neuron formations across layers and checkpoints.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** TopK LMs demonstrate a balance of model efficiency and interpretability, contributing to a deeper understanding of concept learning in language models and aiming to enhance future research on model interpretability and controllability.

**Abstract:** Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs). However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs. The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future research on model interpretability and controllability.

**Abstract:** We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve user engagement in socially-driven dialogues where traditional models may not adequately ensure user engagement.

**Method:** The authors developed a user simulator to interact with interactive LLMs and utilized i×MCTS to gather data on user experiences, focusing on user reactions to influence dialogue intentions directly.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a user simulator for interactive LLMs
	2. Introduction of i×MCTS for collecting user interaction data
	3. Implementation of direct preference optimization for aligning LLMs with user engagement

**Result:** Experiments showed that the proposed method, using preference optimization, significantly improves user engagement in dialogues compared to traditional methods.

**Limitations:** Further research is needed to generalize the findings across diverse dialogue scenarios and user types.

**Conclusion:** Aligning interactive LLMs with direct indicators of user engagement leads to better user experiences in socially-driven dialogue scenarios.

**Abstract:** Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree \textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using \textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces a framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) based on their performance on benchmark datasets, revealing the existence of 'potemkin' understanding where LLMs may appear to understand concepts without genuine comprehension.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To justify the use of benchmark datasets in evaluating LLM capabilities by exploring the nature of understanding reflected in their answers compared to human misunderstandings.

**Method:** The authors develop a formal framework and two procedures for quantifying 'potemkin' understanding across various models and tasks, one using a specially designed benchmark and another providing a lower-bound estimate.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a formal framework for evaluating LLMs' understanding
	2. Development of two procedures for quantifying misunderstanding in LLMs
	3. Identification of widespread 'potemkin' representations in multiple domains.

**Result:** The study finds that 'potemkin' understandings are widespread across different models, tasks, and domains, indicating that these models often demonstrate incoherent concept representations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Success on benchmarks can be illusory if LLMs misinterpret concepts differently than humans, suggesting a need for deeper evaluation beyond traditional benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

**Conclusion:** The findings stress the importance of understanding user interactions with LLMs and suggest enhancements to the healthcare capabilities of conversational AI models.

**Abstract:** People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI.

**Motivation:** To improve language model performance by optimizing the organization of training data, specifically focusing on data efficacy, a relatively underexplored area.

**Method:** DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. It includes a new scoring method called Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) that evaluates data samples based on learnability and quality, and a method called Folding Ordering (FO) to tackle model forgetting and data distribution bias.

**Key Contributions:**

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Data efficacy is a promising foundational area in language model training, complementing data efficiency through effective data selection and organization.

**Abstract:** Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The Customized Sequence Evaluation Metric provides a novel approach to sequence evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing metrics by eliminating the need for human-labeled data and supporting various evaluation types.

**Abstract:** Automatic evaluation of sequence generation, traditionally reliant on metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, often fails to capture the semantic accuracy of generated text sequences due to their emphasis on n-gram overlap. A promising solution to this problem is to develop model-based metrics, such as BLEURT and COMET. However, these approaches are typically hindered by the scarcity of labeled evaluation data, which is necessary to train the evaluation models. In this work, we build upon this challenge by proposing the Customized Sequence Evaluation Metric (CSEM), a three-stage evaluation model training method that utilizes large language models to generate labeled data for model-based metric development, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled data. Additionally, we expand the scope of CSEM to support various evaluation types, including single-aspect, multi-aspect, reference-free, and reference-based evaluations, enabling the customization of metrics to suit diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that CSEM can effectively train an evaluation model without human-labeled data. Further experiments in reinforcement learning and reranking show that metrics developed through CSEM outperform traditional evaluation metrics, leading to substantial improvements in sequence quality as evaluated by both commonly used metrics and ChatGPT.

**Conclusion:** MockLLM shows considerable promise in improving candidate assessment and online recruitment processes.

**Abstract:** Online recruitment platforms have reshaped job-seeking and recruiting processes, driving increased demand for applications that enhance person-job matching. Traditional methods generally rely on analyzing textual data from resumes and job descriptions, limiting the dynamic, interactive aspects crucial to effective recruitment. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed remarkable potential in simulating adaptive, role-based dialogues, making them well-suited for recruitment scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MockLLM}, a novel framework to generate and evaluate mock interview interactions. The system consists of two key components: mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol. By simulating both interviewer and candidate roles, MockLLM enables consistent and collaborative interactions for real-time and two-sided matching. To further improve the matching quality, MockLLM further incorporates reflection memory generation and dynamic strategy modification, refining behaviors based on previous experience. We evaluate MockLLM on real-world data Boss Zhipin, a major Chinese recruitment platform. The experimental results indicate that MockLLM outperforms existing methods in matching accuracy, scalability, and adaptability across job domains, highlighting its potential to advance candidate assessment and online recruitment.

**Keywords:** Deep NLP, Variational Information Bottleneck, Authorship Attribution, Writing Style, Representation Learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new architecture for learning author and document embeddings that incorporates stylistic constraints, enhancing the accuracy of authorship attribution tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing NLP models often overlook the representation learning for authors, limiting their effectiveness in applications involving literary data and writing style.

**Method:** The proposed architecture leverages Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to learn embeddings for authors and documents while incorporating stylistic features to make the representations interpretable in relation to writing style indicators.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck for author representation learning
	2. Stylistic constraints incorporated into embeddings for interpretability
	3. Evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrating improved authorship attribution performance

**Result:** The model was evaluated on datasets including a literary corpus, a blog authorship corpus, and IMDb62, showing improved performance in authorship attribution and better capturing of stylistic aspects compared to strong baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The incorporation of stylistic constraints in the embedding process allows for more accurate representation of authors’ writing styles, making the model applicable to various NLP tasks.

**Abstract:** A wide range of Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) models integrates continuous and low dimensional representations of words and documents. Surprisingly, very few models study representation learning for authors. These representations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification and classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of existing works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making them hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns embeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our model fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of writing style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation axis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our method on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg Project, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it matches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while capturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is limited exploration of privacy-preserving methods for personalizing LLMs, which are crucial for tasks like search and recommendation.

**Method:** The study systematically explores PEFT for LLM personalization and compares it against RAG across seven datasets from the LaMP benchmark.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First systematic study on PEFT for LLM personalization
	2. Extensive comparison between RAG and PEFT methods
	3. Demonstrated improvements in personalized text generation with user data

**Result:** PEFT and RAG methods provide average improvements of 1.07% and 14.92% respectively over non-personalized LLMs, with their integration yielding a 15.98% enhancement.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RAG is particularly advantageous for cold-start users, while PEFT is more effective when more personal data is available, indicating a correlation between data quantity and PEFT effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Despite its substantial impact on various search, recommendation, and question answering tasks, privacy-preserving methods for personalizing large language models (LLMs) have received relatively limited exploration. There is one primary approach in this area through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which generates personalized outputs by enriching the input prompt with information retrieved from the user's personal data. This paper studies an orthogonal approach to RAG that involves learning user-dependent LLM parameters through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents the first systematic study for exploration of PEFT for LLM personalization and provides an extensive comparisons between RAG- and PEFT-based solutions, across a broad set of seven diverse datasets from the LaMP benchmark. Our results demonstrate that, on average, both RAG- and PEFT-based personalization methods yield 14.92% and 1.07% improvements over non-personalized LLMs, respectively. When combining RAG with PEFT, we observe a further improvement of 15.98%, highlighting the effectiveness of their integration in enhancing personalized text generation. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between the amount of user data available and the effectiveness of PEFT. This finding suggests that RAG is particularly beneficial for cold-start users -- users with limited personal data -- while PEFT performs better when more user-specific data is available.

**Result:** The proposed method significantly outperforms existing baselines across 18 RAG models on KILT benchmark datasets, demonstrating effective personalization of retrieval results.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the benefits of personalized retrieval in improving the utility of RAG agents through adaptive search techniques.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the design of a unified search engine to serve multiple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, each with a distinct task, backbone large language model (LLM), and RAG strategy. We introduce an iterative approach where the search engine generates retrieval results for the RAG agents and gathers feedback on the quality of the retrieved documents during an offline phase. This feedback is then used to iteratively optimize the search engine using an expectation-maximization algorithm, with the goal of maximizing each agent's utility function. Additionally, we adapt this to an online setting, allowing the search engine to refine its behavior based on real-time individual agents feedback to better serve the results for each of them. Experiments on datasets from the Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantly on average outperforms baselines across 18 RAG models. We demonstrate that our method effectively ``personalizes'' the retrieval for each RAG agent based on the collected feedback. Finally, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to explore various aspects of our method.

**Motivation:** With the rise of large language models used as agents, there is a need to evaluate their memory security against multi-agent attacks, particularly in real-world independent memory scenarios.

**Method:** The paper proposes the TMCHT framework for large-scale evaluation of multi-agent attacks and introduces the ARCJ method to optimize poisoned sample retrieval and enhance the replication ability of such samples.

**Key Contributions:**

	3. Identification of challenges in multi-agent attack scenarios related to independent memory

**Result:** The ARCJ method shows significant improvements in attack performance, achieving 23.51%, 18.95%, and 52.93% enhancements in various topologies and agent settings within the TMCHT framework.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of addressing memory vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and encourage community focus on their security.

**Abstract:** With the development of large language models, they are widely used as agents in various fields. A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital information but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly focuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world scenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the Troublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale, multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT involves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents. We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph structure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a phenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes the retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and optimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagious ability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%, 18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line topology, star topology, and 100-agent settings. Encourage community attention to the security of multi-agent systems.

**Conclusion:** The development of SceneGenAgent and the accompanying SceneInstruct dataset provides promising tools for accurately generating industrial scenes using LLMs, enhancing their usability in manufacturing simulations.

**Abstract:** The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the underperformance of multilingual LLMs on non-Latin script languages due to their reliance on Latin scripts, which impacts their phonological representation capabilities.

**Method:** The authors propose using phonemic transcriptions alongside traditional orthographic scripts to enhance the representation of languages and introduce a Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy for improved in-context learning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed the use of phonemic transcriptions for script-invariant representations.
	2. Introduced a Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy that utilizes both phonemic and orthographic scripts.
	3. Demonstrated significant performance improvements in multilingual contexts.

**Result:** By integrating phonemic signals, the proposed method leads to performance improvements of up to 12.6% for Latin and 15.1% for non-Latin script languages when compared to traditional ICL methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The integration of phonemic transcriptions significantly improves the performance of multilingual LLMs on both Latin and non-Latin scripts, supporting the need for script-invariant representations in language models.

**Abstract:** Although multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable performance across benchmarks, we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin script languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CodeLutra offers a scalable and efficient method for improving code generation in smaller models, making them competitive with larger models without the need for massive datasets.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation but require significant resources and often over-generalize, limiting their task-specific efficiency. Fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs provides a cost-effective alternative. However, standard supervised approaches rely only on correct examples, missing valuable insights from failures. We introduce CodeLutra, a framework that leverages both correct and incorrect code attempts. Instead of using only correct solutions, CodeLutra applies iterative preference-based refinement, comparing successful and failed outputs to better approximate desired results. This approach narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art larger models without requiring massive datasets or auxiliary models. For instance, on a challenging data science coding task, using only 500 samples improved Llama-3-8B's accuracy from 28.2% to 48.6%, approaching GPT-4's level. By learning from both successes and mistakes, CodeLutra provides a scalable and efficient path to high-quality code generation, making smaller open-source models more competitive with leading closed-source alternatives.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces challenges in the philosophy of language, prompting a reevaluation of traditional semantics.

**Method:** The paper analyzes LLMs using Robert Brandom's inferential semantics, contrasting it with traditional distributional semantics, and examines LLMs' properties and mechanisms like RLHF through the ISA approach.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Application of inferential semantics to LLMs
	2. Development of a consensus theory of truth for LLMs
	3. Highlighting anti-representationalist properties of LLMs

**Result:** LLMs exhibit anti-representationalist features in language processing, suggesting they may redefine traditional concepts in the philosophy of language.

**Limitations:** Highlighted tensions between inferentialism's philosophical tenets and LLMs' sub-symbolic processes.

**Conclusion:** Inferential semantics offers valuable insights into LLM meaning generation, questioning strict semantic compositionality and externalism, though empirical investigations remain necessary.

**Abstract:** The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Claude presents new challenges for philosophy of language, particularly regarding the nature of linguistic meaning and representation. While LLMs have traditionally been understood through distributional semantics, this paper explores Robert Brandom's inferential semantics as an alternative foundational framework for understanding these systems. We examine how key features of inferential semantics -- including its anti-representationalist stance, logical expressivism, and quasi-compositional approach -- align with the architectural and functional characteristics of Transformer-based LLMs. Through analysis of the ISA (Inference, Substitution, Anaphora) approach, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties in their processing of language. We further develop a consensus theory of truth appropriate for LLMs, grounded in their interactive and normative dimensions through mechanisms like RLHF. While acknowledging significant tensions between inferentialism's philosophical commitments and LLMs' sub-symbolic processing, this paper argues that inferential semantics provides valuable insights into how LLMs generate meaning without reference to external world representations. Our analysis suggests that LLMs may challenge traditional assumptions in philosophy of language, including strict compositionality and semantic externalism, though further empirical investigation is needed to fully substantiate these theoretical claims.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RSD offers a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs efficiently in resource-intensive scenarios.

**Abstract:** We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/RSD.

**Conclusion:** Model creators must be aware of privacy risks associated with PII when designing and training models to prevent unintended regurgitation of sensitive information.

**Abstract:** Due to the sensitive nature of personally identifiable information (PII), its owners may have the authority to control its inclusion or request its removal from large-language model (LLM) training. Beyond this, PII may be added or removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques, because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as $\approx\!7.5\times$); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized. Model creators should consider these first- and second-order privacy risks when training models to avoid the risk of new PII regurgitation.

**TL;DR:** This study evaluates the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in automating the extraction of concepts from pulmonary embolism (PE) reports, demonstrating high accuracy and minimal human input requirement.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the efficiency and accuracy of extracting clinical data from radiology reports in PE registries, reducing the reliance on manual abstraction.

**Method:** Four variants of Llama 3 and one reviewer model were tested on 250 dual-annotated CTPE reports from MIMIC IV and Duke University, measuring accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) against human annotations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated high accuracy (up to 0.98) of LLMs in abstracting PE reports.
	2. Showed that dual model workflows can improve data quality with minimal oversight.
	3. Established the feasibility of using LLMs for large-scale medical data extraction.

**Result:** Mean accuracy increased with model size, reaching up to 0.98 with the Phi 4 model. The dual model concordance achieved a PPV of at least 0.95 for PE presence and NPV of at least 0.98, with over 75% full agreement in reports.

**Limitations:** Results were based on a limited set of CTPE reports from two institutions; generalizability to other types of medical reports needs further validation.

**Conclusion:** LLMs can automate and enhance the data abstraction process for PE registries efficiently, allowing for high-quality data collection with reduced human effort.

**Abstract:** Pulmonary embolism (PE) registries accelerate practice improving research but rely on labor intensive manual abstraction of radiology reports. We examined whether openly available large language models (LLMs) can automate concept extraction from computed tomography PE (CTPE) reports without loss of data quality. Four Llama 3 variants (3.0 8B, 3.1 8B, 3.1 70B, 3.3 70B) and one reviewer model, Phi 4 14B, were tested on 250 dual annotated CTPE reports from each of MIMIC IV and Duke University. Accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) versus a human gold standard were measured across model size, temperature and shot count. Mean accuracy rose with scale: 0.83 (3.0 8B), 0.91 (3.1 8B) and 0.96 for both 70B variants; Phi 4 14B reached 0.98. Accuracy differed by less than 0.03 between datasets, indicating external robustness. In dual model concordance (L3 70B plus Phi 4 14B) PPV for PE presence was at least 0.95 and NPV at least 0.98, while location, thrombus burden, right heart strain and image quality artifacts each achieved PPV of at least 0.90 and NPV of at least 0.95. Fewer than four percent of individual concept annotations were discordant, and full agreement occurred in more than seventy five percent of reports. Large language models therefore provide a scalable, accurate solution for PE registry abstraction, and a dual model review workflow can safeguard data quality with minimal human oversight.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents SACL, a framework that improves code retrieval and generation by enriching textual information and addressing biases towards well-documented code.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance code generation by retrieving relevant information more effectively and to address biases in current retrieval methods.

**Method:** The authors conduct an analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking certain features, while proposing SACL to augment code and structural knowledge with semantic information.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of SACL framework for code retrieval enhancement.
	2. Systematic analysis of current retrieval methods and their biases.
	3. Demonstrated improvement in recall and generation performance metrics.

**Result:** SACL shows significant improvement in code retrieval performance, with increases in Recall@1 by 12.8% on HumanEval and 9.4% on MBPP, leading to a 4.88% improvement in Pass@1 on HumanEval.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on well-documented code, and the effects of SACL on poorly documented code are not explored.

**Conclusion:** The findings validate that enhancing retrieval methods can lead to better code generation outcomes, while also reducing reliance on irrelevant documentation.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include: (1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is irrelevant. Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval / MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance (e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** diffusion models, large language models, code generation

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper explores the decoding behavior and reinforcement learning methods of diffusion large language models (dLLMs) in code generation, presenting a new model, DiffuCoder.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are under-explored, necessitating a systematic investigation to unlock their potential for code generation.

**Method:** The paper introduces the DiffuCoder model trained on 130B tokens and analyzes its denoising processes, proposing a novel sampling scheme called coupled-GRPO to enhance RL training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DiffuCoder, a dLLM for code generation.
	2. Systematic investigation of dLLM denoising processes.
	3. Proposal of coupled-GRPO, a novel RL training scheme.

**Result:** DiffuCoder outperforms existing models by +4.4% on the EvalPlus code generation benchmarks, revealing insights into dLLM generation and reducing AR bias during decoding.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study advances the understanding of dLLM decoding and proposes an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework.

**Abstract:** Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR bias during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.
