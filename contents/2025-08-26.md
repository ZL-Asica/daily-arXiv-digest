**Conclusion:** This work offers practical guidance to HCI researchers for developing more effective biomechanical models that exhibit human-like interaction fidelity.

**Abstract:** Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations, and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

**Keywords:** virtual reality, user intention prediction, time-series analysis, machine learning, LSTM

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This thesis studies user intention prediction in VR using time-series data from hand movements, highlighting robust performance of regression models over classification models.

**Read time:** 45 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance immersive VR experiences by accurately predicting user intentions, particularly in complex tasks that require haptic feedback.

**Method:** The study analyzes classification and regression techniques on time-series data gathered from 810 trials of various grasping motions involving different object types and sizes, with a focus on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Utilization of time-series data to predict user intentions in VR
	2. Comparison of classification and regression methods for hand movements
	3. Insights on user variability affecting model performance

**Result:** Regression-based approaches, especially LSTM, outperform classification models, achieving timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors of 5-20 cm before grasping actions.

**Limitations:** Challenges in predicting exact hand postures persist despite improvements in model performance.

**Conclusion:** Regression models hold potential for improving VR interactions through adaptive feedback, but challenges remain in predicting precise hand postures.

**Abstract:** Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast, regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user actions in VR.

### [5] [Humans Perceive Wrong Narratives from AI Reasoning Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16599)

*Mosh Levy, Zohar Elyoseph, Yoav Goldberg*

**Main category:** cs.HC

**Keywords:** AI interpretability, human-computer interaction, reasoning text, causal influence, language models

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper examines the gap between human understanding and AI models' reasoning texts, demonstrating low accuracy in identifying causal influences which challenges the effectiveness of these texts as interpretability tools.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the correspondence between human understanding of AI-generated reasoning texts and the actual computational processes of the models.

**Method:** The study evaluated participant ability to identify causally influential steps in reasoning texts using counterfactual measurements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identifies a significant gap between human and model reasoning interpretability.
	2. Highlights the low accuracy of humans in tracing causal influences in reasoning text.
	3. Calls for a shift in perspective towards reasoning texts as artifacts for investigation.

**Result:** Participant accuracy was found to be only 29.3%, indicating a significant discrepancy in understanding, which remained low at 42% even when considering majority votes on high-agreement questions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings reveal a fundamental gap in interpreting reasoning texts, suggesting they should be investigated rather than assumed to provide clear interpretability, and highlight the need for research into non-human language usage by models.

**Abstract:** A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.

**Motivation:** To overcome limitations of traditional AR navigation systems that rely on rigid input and predefined commands, enabling more flexible interactions that leverage rich building data.

**Method:** The proposed system integrates BIM with three language agents (Triage, Search, and Response) built on LLMs for interpreting user queries and planning routes in an embodied AR setting.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of BIM with a multi-agent RAG framework for AR navigation

**Result:** A user study resulted in a SUS score of 80.5, demonstrating high usability, and evaluations indicated improved perception of system intelligence with the embodied interface.

**Limitations:** The research is limited to its implementation specifics and user study scope, which may not generalize across all AR navigation scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of language-driven reasoning and embodied interaction in creating user-centered AR navigation systems.

**Abstract:** Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible, language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR navigation systems.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand and improve the integration of social robots into public spaces amidst unpredictable and diverse human interactions.

**Method:** Observation of interactions during a three-day pilot deployment of a social robot in a large church and visitor attraction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical insights into atypical user interactions with social robots in public spaces.
	2. Strategies for enhancing human-robot interactions based on real-world observations.
	3. Theoretical frameworks for future advancements in HRI.

**Result:** Identified atypical user interactions and proposed theoretical and practical solutions for enhancing robot deployment in public spaces.

**Limitations:** Study limited to a specific public space and duration; broader applicability may require further research.

**Conclusion:** The findings offer empirical insights and actionable guidance for designers of social robots to improve user interactions in real-world settings.

**Abstract:** Though a goal of HRI is the natural integration of social robots into everyday public spaces, real-world studies still occur mostly within controlled environments with predetermined participants. True public spaces present an environment which is largely unconstrained and unpredictable, frequented by a diverse range of people whose goals can often conflict with those of the robot. When combined with the general unfamiliarity most people have with social robots, this leads to unexpected human-robot interactions in these public spaces that are rarely discussed or detected in other contexts. In this paper, we describe atypical users we observed interacting with our robot, and those who did not, during a three-day pilot deployment within a large working church and visitor attraction. We then discuss theoretical future advances in the field that could address these challenges, as well as immediate practical mitigations and strategies to help improve public space human-robot interactions in the present. This work contributes empirical insights into the dynamics of human-robot interaction in public environments and offers actionable guidance for more effective future deployments for social robot designers.

**TL;DR:** The study presents an app that analyzes real-time app usage data to predict academic grades, highlighting important associations between app categories and student performance.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing studies have limitations due to reliance on self-reported data and prolonged prediction periods, hindering early intervention for improving academic grades.

**Method:** An app was developed to retrieve app usage data from the past week quickly. Data from 124 Bangladeshi students was analyzed to explore the relationship between app usage and CGPA.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an app for real-time data retrieval
	2. Identification of significant relationships between app usage and CGPA
	3. Machine learning model predicting CGPA from app usage data

**Result:** The analysis found a significant negative association between overall app usage sessions and CGPA, while Productivity and Books categories showed positive associations. The ML model predicts CGPA within 0.36 of the actual value.

**Limitations:** The study is based on a specific demographic (Bangladeshi students), which may not generalize to other populations.

**Conclusion:** These findings suggest that real-time app usage data can inform strategies for academic improvement, specifically by focusing on certain app categories.

**Abstract:** Due to usage of self-reported data which may contain biasness, the existing studies may not unveil the exact relation between academic grades and app categories such as Video. Additionally, the existing systems' requirement for data of prolonged period to predict grades may not facilitate early intervention to improve it. Thus, we presented an app that retrieves past 7 days' actual app usage data within a second (Mean=0.31s, SD=1.1s). Our analysis on 124 Bangladeshi students' real-time data demonstrates app usage sessions have a significant (p<0.05) negative association with CGPA. However, the Productivity and Books categories have a significant positive association whereas Video has a significant negative association. Moreover, the high and low CGPA holders have significantly different app usage behavior. Leveraging only the instantly accessed data, our machine learning model predicts CGPA within 0.36 of the actual CGPA. We discuss the design implications that can be potential for students to improve grades.

**Relevance Score:** 4

**TL;DR:** The paper investigates the impact of visual segmentations on word recognition in reading, finding that these interventions slow down identification despite training.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how different visual interventions can assist in the segmentation of words for better reading comprehension and efficiency.

**Method:** Conducted pre-registered lexical decision experiments with 192 participants to test five types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections, underlines, and color.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical measurement of the impact of visual segmentations on reading speed.
	2. Identification of unique interaction patterns between typography and visual elements that challenge existing theories.
	3. Practical insights for text visualization techniques in reading contexts.

**Result:** Visual interventions slowed down word identification during reading, although effects varied by intervention type.

**Limitations:** Findings are based on typical adult readers with specific training; may not generalize to all populations.

**Conclusion:** Accelerating lexical decision tasks through visual interventions is unlikely; empirical measurements provide insights for future text visualization practices without compromising reading performance.

**Abstract:** When a reader encounters a word in English, they split the word into smaller orthographic units in the process of recognizing its meaning. For example, "rough", when split according to phonemes, is decomposed as r-ou-gh (not as r-o-ugh or r-ough), where each group of letters corresponds to a sound. Since there are many ways to segment a group of letters, this constitutes a computational operation that has to be solved by the reading brain, many times per minute, in order to achieve the recognition of words in text necessary for reading. We hypothesized that providing segmentation information in the text itself could help the reading process by reducing its computational cost. In this paper we explore whether and how different visual interventions could communicate segmentation information for reading and word recognition. We ran a series of pre-registered lexical decision experiments with 192 participants that tested five types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections, underlines and color. The evidence indicates that, even with a moderate amount of training, these visual interventions always slow down word identification, but each to a different extent. These findings are important because they indicate that, at least for typical adult readers with a moderate amount of specific training in these visual interventions, accelerating the lexical decision task is unlikely. The results also offer an empirical measurement of the cost of a common set of visual manipulations of text, which can be useful for practitioners seeking to visualize alongside or within text without impacting reading performance. Finally, the interaction between typographically encoded information and visual variables presented unique patterns that deviate from existing theories, suggesting new directions for future inquiry.

**Conclusion:** Participants found TextOnly usable and preferred it over manual input methods, highlighting its effectiveness compared to traditional voice assistants in managing text-related tasks.

**Abstract:** Text boxes serve as portals to diverse functionalities in today's smartphone applications. However, when it comes to specific functionalities, users always need to navigate through multiple steps to access particular text boxes for input. We propose TextOnly, a unified function portal that enables users to access text-related functions from various applications by simply inputting text into a sole text box. For instance, entering a restaurant name could trigger a Google Maps search, while a greeting could initiate a conversation in WhatsApp. Despite their brevity, TextOnly maximizes the utilization of these raw text inputs, which contain rich information, to interpret user intentions effectively. TextOnly integrates large language models(LLM) and a BERT model. The LLM consistently provides general knowledge, while the BERT model can continuously learn user-specific preferences and enable quicker predictions. Real-world user studies demonstrated TextOnly's effectiveness with a top-1 accuracy of 71.35%, and its ability to continuously improve both its accuracy and inference speed. Participants perceived TextOnly as having satisfactory usability and expressed a preference for TextOnly over manual executions. Compared with voice assistants, TextOnly supports a greater range of text-related functions and allows for more concise inputs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SCENIC effectively engages children during car rides, providing cognitive development opportunities through interactive exploration of the external environment.

**Abstract:** Car-riding is common for children in modern life. Given the repetitive nature of daily commutes, they often feel bored and turn to electronic devices for entertainment. Meanwhile, the rich and dynamic scenery outside the car naturally attracts children's curiosity and offers valuable resources for cognitive development. Our formative study reveals that parents' support during car rides is often fleeting, as accompanying adults may struggle to consistently guide children's exploration. To address this, we propose SCENIC, an interactive system that helps children aged 6 to 11 better perceive the external environment using location-based cognitive development strategies. SCENIC builds upon experiential approaches used by parents, resulting in six strategies embedded into the system. To improve engagement during routine rides, SCENIC also incorporates dynamic point-of-interest selection and journey gallery generation. We evaluated the generated content (N=21) and conducted an in-situ user study with seven families and ten children. Results suggest that SCENIC enhances the car-riding experience and helps children better connect with their surroundings.

**Conclusion:** The Arabic LLM-D12 is a psychometrically sound instrument that is culturally appropriate, providing a necessary tool for research and policy on AI engagement in Arab contexts.

**Abstract:** There is an urgent need for reliable, culturally validated instruments to assess psychological responses to AI in general and large language models (LLMs). This need is global issue, but it is especially urgent among Arabic-speaking populations, where AI and LLMs adoption is accelerating, yet psychometric tools remain limited. This study presents the first validation of the LLM-D12, a dual-dimensional scale assessing Instrumental and Relationship Dependency on LLMs, in an Arab sample. A total of 250 Arab participants completed the Arabic version of the LLM-D12. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirms the original 2-factor structure of LLM-D12 with all items showing good loading of corresponding Instrumental and Relationship Dependency. The scale showed good to excellent internal reliability (Cronbach alpha is 0.90 for Total, 0.85 for Instrumental Dependency, and 0.90 for Relationship Dependency). External validation revealed that Instrumental Dependency was positively associated with AI acceptance and internet addiction, while Relationship Dependency was linked to lower need for cognition and greater trustworthiness of LLM, demonstrating sensitivity of this instrument to different use and personal factors. These findings confirm that Arabic LLM-D12 is a psychometrically sound, culturally appropriate instrument, offering a necessary tool for research, education, and policy concerning AI and LLMs engagement in Arab contexts.

**Result:** AI-driven gesture recognition in VR provides real-time feedback, enhancing learner engagement; however, challenges include hardware limitations and inconsistent accuracy.

**Limitations:** Challenges include hardware limitations, inconsistent gesture recognition accuracy, and a need for more inclusive designs.

**Conclusion:** The review synthesizes technological innovations and outlines recommendations for developers to improve inclusivity and effectiveness in sign language education.

**Abstract:** Sign language (SL) is an essential mode of communication for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals. Its education remains limited by the lack of qualified instructors, insufficient early exposure, and the inadequacy of traditional teaching methods. Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising new approaches to enhance sign language learning through immersive, interactive, and feedback-rich environments. This paper presents a systematic review of 55 peer-reviewed studies on VR-based sign language education, identifying and analyzing five core thematic areas: (1) gesture recognition and real-time feedback mechanisms; (2) interactive VR environments for communicative practice; (3) gamification for immersive and motivating learning experiences; (4) personalized and adaptive learning systems; and (5) accessibility and inclusivity for diverse DHH learners.   The results reveal that AI-driven gesture recognition systems integrated with VR can provide real-time feedback, significantly improving learner engagement and performance. However, the analysis highlights critical challenges: hardware limitations, inconsistent accuracy in gesture recognition, and a lack of inclusive and adaptive design. This review contributes a comprehensive synthesis of technological and pedagogical innovations in the field, outlining current limitations and proposing actionable recommendations for developers and researchers. By bridging technical advancement with inclusive pedagogy, this review lays the foundation for next-generation VR systems that are equitable, effective, and accessible for sign language learners worldwide.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the effectiveness of existing design heuristics for categorical visualizations based on empirical psychological knowledge, specifically the subitizing phenomenon.

**Method:** Conducted three experiments using multi-class scatterplots with varying design choices and class numbers (2 to 15) across three different tasks: class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical evidence linking cognitive psychology to data visualization effectiveness.
	2. Identification of category limit (six) influencing visualization task performance.
	3. Framework for applying psychological principles to visualization design guidelines.

**Result:** Performance in tasks remained high when the number of categories was below six; however, it diminished significantly as the number of categories increased, with variations depending on the specific task and encoding employed.

**Limitations:** Focus on specific tasks and types of visualizations; results may not generalize to all visualization contexts.

**Conclusion:** The findings provide empirical support for the application of psychological theories in visualization design, suggesting that future work should leverage these theories to enhance understanding of visualization perception.

**Abstract:** Understanding how people perceive visualizations is crucial for designing effective visual data representations; however, many heuristic design guidelines are derived from specific tasks or visualization types, without considering the constraints or conditions under which those guidelines hold. In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology -- people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting -- in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots -- between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices -- across three different tasks -- class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments -- to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.

**Motivation:** There is a critical gap in understanding causal mechanisms from health data that is crucial for healthcare decision-making.

**Method:** The paper advocates for increased research on Visual Analytics to support sound causal reasoning from complex health data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Advocates for more VA research focused on causal inference in health data
	2. Identification of specific challenges in utilizing causal reasoning approaches
	3. Proposal of new VA tools to enhance human decision-making in healthcare

**Result:** Advances in VA research could lead to new tools that improve causal inference capabilities, thereby enhancing data-driven healthcare practices.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Improving causal reasoning tools can lead to better understanding and intervention strategies in healthcare, ultimately improving health outcomes.

**Abstract:** The increasing capture and analysis of large-scale longitudinal health data offer opportunities to improve healthcare and advance medical understanding. However, a critical gap exists between (a) -- the observation of patterns and correlations, versus (b) -- the understanding of true causal mechanisms that drive outcomes. An accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms that cause various changes in medical status is crucial for decision-makers across various healthcare domains and roles, yet inferring causality from real-world observational data is difficult for both methodological and practical challenges. This Grand Challenge advocates increased Visual Analytics (VA) research on this topic to empower people with the tool for sound causal reasoning from health data. We note this is complicated by the complex nature of medical data -- the volume, variety, sparsity, and temporality of health data streams make the use of causal inference algorithms difficult. Combined with challenges imposed by the realities of health-focused settings, including time constraints and traditional medical work practices, existing causal reasoning approaches are valuable but insufficient. We argue that advances in research can lead to new VA tools that augment human expertise with intuitive and robust causal inference capabilities, which can help realize a new paradigm of data-driven, causality-aware healthcare practices that improve human health outcomes.

**Conclusion:** This research demonstrates the feasibility of creating personalized, AI-assisted AR tools to enhance sound accessibility for DHH users.

**Abstract:** Augmented reality (AR) has shown promise for supporting Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals by captioning speech and visualizing environmental sounds, yet existing systems do not allow users to create personalized sound visualizations. We present SonoCraftAR, a proof-of-concept prototype that empowers DHH users to author custom sound-reactive AR interfaces using typed natural language input. SonoCraftAR integrates real-time audio signal processing with a multi-agent LLM pipeline that procedurally generates animated 2D interfaces via a vector graphics library. The system extracts the dominant frequency of incoming audio and maps it to visual properties such as size and color, making the visualizations respond dynamically to sound. This early exploration demonstrates the feasibility of open-ended sound-reactive AR interface authoring and discusses future opportunities for personalized, AI-assisted tools to improve sound accessibility.

**Motivation:** To enhance the experience of remote meetings by allowing absent users to participate via virtual agents, aiming to improve social presence and engagement.

**Method:** Two mixed-method studies with 45 participants using the Wizard-of-Oz approach to evaluate experiences of both present and absent meeting participants.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces Stand-in Enhanced Asynchronous Meetings (SEAM) concept.
	2. Demonstrates proof of concept for improving user experience in remote meetings.
	3. Highlights benefits for both present attendees and absent users.

**Result:** Stand-in agents in VR meetings improved information access for present attendees and enhanced feelings of inclusion for absent users watching recordings.

**Limitations:** Limited sample size; findings may not generalize to all types of meetings or industries.

**Conclusion:** The SEAM concept shows potential for asynchronous meetings to support collaborative interactions that resemble synchronous communication.

**Abstract:** We propose and explore the user experience of SEAM -- Stand-in Enhanced Asynchronous Meetings -- virtual reality meetings in which embodied virtual agents represent absent users. During the meeting, attendees can address the agent, and the absent user can later watch the recording from its perspective to respond. Through two mixed-method studies with 45 participants using the Wizard-of-Oz approach, we explored both the perspectives of the attendees in the original meeting and of the absent users later re-watching the meeting. We found that the stand-in can enhance meetings, benefiting both present and absent collaborators. Present attendees can easily access information that drives decision-making in the meeting perceive high social presence of absentees. Absentees also felt included when watching recordings because of the social interactions and attention towards them. Our contributions demonstrate a proof of concept for future asynchronous meetings in which collaborators can interact conversationally more akin to how they would if it had been synchronous.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dataset supports the development of adaptive autonomous vehicle systems that can respond to driver trust and comfort levels, thereby enhancing safety and user experience.

**Abstract:** Understanding and estimating driver trust and comfort are essential for the safety and widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Existing works analyze user trust and comfort separately, with limited real-time assessment and insufficient multimodal data. This paper introduces a novel multimodal dataset called TRUCE-AV, focusing on trust and comfort estimation in autonomous vehicles. The dataset collects real-time trust votes and continuous comfort ratings of 31 participants during a simulator-based fully autonomous driving. Simultaneously, physiological signals, such as heart rate, gaze, and emotions, along with environmental data (e.g., vehicle speed, nearby vehicle positions, and velocity), are recorded throughout the drives. Standard pre- and post-drive questionnaires were also administered to assess participants' trust in automation and overall well-being, enabling the correlation of subjective assessments with real-time responses. To demonstrate the utility of our dataset, we evaluated various machine learning models for trust and comfort estimation using physiological data. Our analysis showed that tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost and non-linear models such as KNN and MLP regressor achieved the best performance for trust classification and comfort regression. Additionally, we identified key features that contribute to these estimations by using SHAP analysis on the top-performing models. Our dataset enables the development of adaptive AV systems capable of dynamically responding to user trust and comfort levels non-invasively, ultimately enhancing safety, user experience, and human-centered vehicle design.

**Motivation:** To investigate the awareness and perceptions of Indian Internet users regarding data privacy, cookie banners, and the newly introduced DPDPA.

**Method:** An online anonymous survey was conducted with 428 participants to assess their perspectives on cookie banners, attitudes towards online privacy, and acceptance of contentious DPDPA clauses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First exploration of Indian users' awareness of cookie banners and DPDPA
	2. Identification of skepticism towards the government affecting privacy perceptions
	3. Insights into user demands for policy revisions regarding data privacy

**Result:** Privacy-conscious users displayed inconsistent awareness of privacy mechanisms, and concerns about privacy do not always translate into protective actions. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses indicated skepticism towards government accountability influences perceptions of the DPDPA.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study emphasizes the necessity for clearer communication about the DPDPA, user-centric consent mechanisms, and policy refinements to improve data privacy practices in India.

**Abstract:** With the rapid increase in online interactions, concerns over data privacy and transparency of data processing practices have become more pronounced. While regulations like the GDPR have driven the widespread adoption of cookie banners in the EU, India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) promises similar changes domestically, aiming to introduce a framework for data protection. However, certain clauses within the DPDPA raise concerns about potential infringements on user privacy, given the exemptions for government accountability and user consent requirements. In this study, for the first time, we explore Indian Internet users' awareness and perceptions of cookie banners, online privacy, and privacy regulations, especially in light of the newly passed DPDPA. We conducted an online anonymous survey with 428 Indian participants, which addressed: (1) users' perspectives on cookie banners, (2) their attitudes towards online privacy and privacy regulations, and (3) their acceptance of 10 contentious DPDPA clauses that favor state authorities and may enable surveillance. Our findings reveal that privacy-conscious users often lack consistent awareness of privacy mechanisms, and their concerns do not always lead to protective actions. Our thematic analysis of 143 open ended responses shows that users' privacy and data protection concerns are rooted in skepticism towards the government, shaping their perceptions of the DPDPA and fueling demands for policy revisions. Our study highlights the need for clearer communication regarding the DPDPA, user-centric consent mechanisms, and policy refinements to enhance data privacy practices in India.

**Keywords:** silent speech, paralinguistics, biosignals, speech synthesis, affective computing

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper surveys the emerging field of Silent Paralinguistics, which aims to derive paralinguistic information from silent speech to enhance communication through biosignal processing.

**Read time:** 21 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing silent speech interfaces that primarily focus on recognition and synthesis without considering paralinguistic information.

**Method:** The paper reviews various methods and research strategies within silent speech research, emphasizing the integration of affective states into speech reconstruction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the concept of Silent Paralinguistics.
	2. Proposes methods to derive affective states from silent speech.
	3. Surveys existing research and gaps in silent speech technologies.

**Result:** The study highlights the gap in current research for predicting paralinguistic information from silent speech and proposes a framework for integrating this into audible speech synthesis.

**Limitations:** The paper primarily offers a theoretical framework without extensive experimental validation.

**Conclusion:** Integrating paralinguistic cues into silent speech interfaces can improve the naturalness of synthesized speech and facilitate better communication in constrained environments.

**Abstract:** The ability to speak is an inherent part of human nature and fundamental to our existence as a social species. Unfortunately, this ability can be restricted in certain situations, such as for individuals who have lost their voice or in environments where speaking aloud is unsuitable. Additionally, some people may prefer not to speak audibly due to privacy concerns. For such cases, silent speech interfaces have been proposed, which focus on processing biosignals corresponding to silently produced speech. These interfaces enable synthesis of audible speech from biosignals that are produced when speaking silently and recognition aka decoding of biosignals into text that corresponds to the silently produced speech. While recognition and synthesis of silent speech has been a prominent focus in many research studies, there is a significant gap in deriving paralinguistic information such as affective states from silent speech. To fill this gap, we propose Silent Paralinguistics, aiming to predict paralinguistic information from silent speech and ultimately integrate it into the reconstructed audible voice for natural communication. This survey provides a comprehensive look at methods, research strategies, and objectives within the emerging field of silent paralinguistics.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a framework that utilizes user feedback in recommender systems (RSs) to enhance user simulations and aligns Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of utilizing user feedback in recommender systems for the effective simulation of user behavior and improve the alignment of LLMs with human preferences.

**Method:** The framework employs LLMs to generate cognitive decision-making processes from user feedback, reducing ambiguity and noise, followed by a data distillation process that filters simulation samples based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a novel data construction framework for user simulations in RSs.
	2. Implements a two-phase process using LLMs to improve user feedback interpretation.
	3. Demonstrates enhanced alignment with human preferences and reasoning capabilities of LLMs through extensive experiments.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the alignment of LLMs with human preferences and enhances their reasoning capabilities in the context of RSs.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This work aims to contribute to the recommender systems community and provide insights for human-centric AI research by leveraging user feedback effectively.

**Abstract:** User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data. Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes. Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when interacting with RSs. We believe our work will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges faced by analysts in constructing coherent visual data stories from discrete insights, amidst the complexity of their relations and the inefficiencies of existing methods.

**Method:** The InReAcTable framework employs an insight graph for structural filtering followed by a reasoning module that uses retrieval-augmented generation with large language models for semantic filtering, guiding users towards relevant insight recommendations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the InReAcTable framework for visual data story construction.
	2. Development of a prototype that utilizes the framework to interactively assist users.
	3. Validation of the framework's utility and effectiveness through case studies and user experiments.

**Result:** The framework and its prototype were tested through a case study and user experiment, demonstrating significant utility and effectiveness in helping users construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical objectives.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address potential scalability issues with larger datasets or the adaptability of the framework to various domains outside the scope of the study.

**Conclusion:** InReAcTable offers a structured approach to enhance the traditional methods of constructing visual data stories, making the process more efficient and user-friendly through interactive solutions.

**Abstract:** Insights in tabular data capture valuable patterns that help analysts understand critical information. Organizing related insights into visual data stories is crucial for in-depth analysis. However, constructing such stories is challenging because of the complexity of the inherent relations between extracted insights. Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights. Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype system for interactively building visual data stories.

**Motivation:** Address the high costs and complexity of creating new text designs in Korean and Chinese, which require numerous unique glyphs.

**Method:** The authors proposed a training strategy called Legacy Learning that recombines and transforms existing text design models to generate new designs without manual processes.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Legacy Learning training strategy
	2. Demonstrated improvement in text design quality metrics
	3. High usability scores from both experts and general users

**Result:** The use of Legacy Learning showed over a 30% improvement in FID and LPIPS metrics and increased OCR recognition accuracy, demonstrating better quality and usability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Legacy Learning can significantly enhance efficiency and quality in the production of text designs for metaverse applications.

**Abstract:** The metaverse consists of hardware, software, and content, among which text design plays a critical role in enhancing user immersion and usability as a content element. However, in languages such as Korean and Chinese that require thousands of unique glyphs, creating new text designs involves high costs and complexity. To address this, this study proposes a training strategy called Legacy Learning, which recombines and transforms structures based on existing text design models. This approach enables the generation of new text designs and improves quality without manual design processes. To evaluate Legacy Learning, it was applied to Korean and Chinese text designs. Additionally, we compared results before and after on seven state of the art text generation models. As a result, text designs generated using Legacy Learning showed over a 30% difference in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metrics compared to the originals, and also exhibited meaningful style variations in visual comparisons. Furthermore, the repeated learning process improved the structural consistency of the generated characters, and an OCR based evaluation showed increasing recognition accuracy across iterations, indicating improved legibility of the generated glyphs. In addition, a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey was conducted to evaluate usability among metaverse content designers and general users. The expert group recorded a score of 95.78 ("Best Imaginable"), while the non expert group scored 76.42 ("Excellent"), indicating an overall high level of usability. These results suggest that Legacy Learning can significantly improve both the production efficiency and quality of text design in the metaverse environment.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The assessment of Visual Data Literacy (VDL) has not adequately addressed its multidimensionality, which encompasses various facets such as numeracy and graph familiarity.

**Method:** A survey was conducted with 438 participants to evaluate their visual data literacy across six dimensions: General Impression/Abstract Thinking, Graph Elements/Familiarity, Aesthetic Perception, Visualization Criticism, Data Reading Tasks, and Numeracy/Topic Knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MAVIL as a framework for assessing Visual Data Literacy
	2. Identified significant deficits in public understanding of data visualizations
	3. Survey results highlighting areas for educational improvement in VDL

**Result:** The survey indicated that 48% of participants made mistakes with simple charts, with significant deficits in understanding basic data units and unfamiliarity with chart types being prevalent.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a specific demographic in Austria, which may affect generalizability.

**Conclusion:** There is a clear need for improved data literacy among the population, indicated by the survey results. The MAVIL framework can help assess and develop visual data literacy over multiple dimensions.

**Abstract:** The ability to read, interpret, and critique data visualizations has mainly been assessed using data visualization tasks like value retrieval. Although evidence on different facets of Visual Data Literacy (VDL) is well established in visualization research and includes numeracy, graph familiarity, or aesthetic elements, they have not been sufficiently considered in ability assessments. Here, VDL is considered a multidimensional ability whose facets can be partially self-assessed. We introduce an assessment in which VDL is deconstructed as a process of understanding, in reference to frameworks from the learning sciences. MAVIL, Multidimensional Assessment of Visual Data Literacy, is composed of six ability dimensions: General Impression/Abstract Thinking, Graph Elements/Familiarity, Aesthetic Perception, Visualization Criticism, Data Reading Tasks and Numeracy/Topic Knowledge. MAVIL was designed for general audiences and implemented in a survey (n=438), representative of Austria's age groups (18-74 years) and gender split. The survey mirrors the population's VDL and shows the perception of two climate data visualizations, a line and bar chart. We found that 48% of respondents make mistakes with the simple charts, while 5% believe that they cannot summarize the visualization content. About a quarter have deficits in comprehending simple data units, and 19-20% are unfamiliar with each displayed chart type.

**Motivation:** To explore the correspondence between human interpretation of AI-generated reasoning texts and the actual computational processes of the models, particularly for transparency and interpretability.

**Method:** Evaluated participants' ability to identify causal influences in reasoning texts using questions based on counterfactual measurements.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified low human accuracy in interpreting AI reasoning texts
	2. Challenged the utility of reasoning texts as interpretability tools
	3. Proposed a new direction for research on AI language use

**Result:** Participants showed a significant discrepancy in accuracy, with only 29.3% identifying causal steps, remaining low at 42% for majority votes on highly agreed questions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight a fundamental gap in understanding reasoning texts, suggesting these should be treated as artifacts for investigation rather than reliable interpretability tools.

**Abstract:** A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate that GreenTEA outperforms both human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt optimization across various reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GreenTEA effectively enhances the prompt optimization process, reducing computational costs while improving LLM performance in complex tasks.

**Abstract:** High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning, commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The CDR framework effectively integrates cognitive science principles with AI design, enabling adaptive reasoning that enhances LLM performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR) framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings, stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

**Read time:** 18 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Test-time scaling has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning and task performance of LLMs by utilizing additional computational resources during inference.

**Method:** The paper surveys diverse verification approaches in TTS, analyzing their training methods and categorizing their types.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive survey of verification methods for test-time scaling in LLMs.
	2. Unified categorization of different verifier training mechanisms.
	3. Creation of a public repository for TTS verifiers.

**Result:** It provides a unified view of verification techniques and their application in optimizing LLM performance at inference time, along with a repository of resources.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The work contributes to the understanding of TTS by systematically cataloging and discussing verification methods, highlighting their significance in performance enhancement.

**Abstract:** Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought, Interpretability, Question-Answering, Supervised Fine-tuning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the interpretability of Chain-of-Thought reasoning traces in Large Language Models, revealing that high performance does not necessarily align with user interpretability.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore whether the semantic interpretability of reasoning traces is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models in task execution.

**Method:** The study fine-tunes LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces and conducts a human-subject study with 100 participants to evaluate the interpretability of these traces.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Findings that challenge the assumption of interpretability in reasoning traces for LLMs
	2. Empirical analysis of the trade-off between interpretability and performance in LLMs
	3. Contribution to the discussion on how LLMs can leverage reasoning traces for better outcomes

**Result:** Fine-tuning on DeepSeek R1 traces led to the strongest model performance, but these traces were rated the least interpretable by users, highlighting a disconnect between model performance and human interpretability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Intermediate reasoning traces do not need to be interpretable for LLM task performance to improve, suggesting a potential decoupling of performance from user interpretability.

**Abstract:** Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: (1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3) LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with 100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable. These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from end user interpretability.

### [42] [QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16697)

*Nicole Cho, William Watson, Alec Koppel, Sumitra Ganesh, Manuela Veloso*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, hallucination, query rewriting, bandit framework, machine learning

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** QueryBandits is introduced as a bandit framework to proactively mitigate hallucinations in LLMs by reshaping queries rather than filtering outputs.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the high prevalence of hallucinations in LLMs by redesigning input queries to avoid triggering these issues, rather than relying solely on after-the-fact filtering.

**Method:** The study employs a bandit framework leveraging 17 linguistic features of input queries to inform rewriting strategies that maximize a reward model, thereby steering LLMs away from generating hallucinations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of QueryBandits as a proactive strategy for hallucination mitigation in LLMs
	2. Empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of query rewriting over traditional filtering techniques
	3. Identification of the inadequacy of static rewriting strategies in certain contexts.

**Result:** QueryBandit, particularly through Thompson Sampling, achieves an 87.5% win rate over a no-rewrite baseline and significantly outperforms static prompting methods, indicating its effectiveness in query-based hallucination mitigation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** QueryBandits demonstrates that guided query rewriting can effectively reduce hallucinations in LLMs, and the findings challenge the efficacy of common static rewriting strategies.

**Abstract:** Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore, proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting ("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite. Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

**TL;DR:** The paper examines consciousness-like behaviors in LLMs through the Maze Test, revealing progress in reasoning but a lack of persistent self-awareness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate consciousness-related behaviors in Large Language Models and evaluate their capabilities and limitations in terms of spatial awareness, perspective, and goal-directed behavior.

**Method:** The study utilized the Maze Test, synthesizing consciousness theories into essential characteristics to assess the performance of 12 LLMs across various learning scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces the Maze Test as a measure for evaluating consciousness-like behaviors in LLMs.
	2. Synthesizes theories of consciousness into 13 essential characteristics for assessment.
	3. Findings indicate a gap in LLMs' self-awareness despite improved reasoning abilities.

**Result:** Reasoning-capable LLMs outperformed standard versions, with Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching 80.5% Partial Path Accuracy.

**Limitations:** The models tested struggled with maintaining coherent self-models, indicating limitations in their consciousness-like characteristics.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs demonstrate advancements in reasoning associated with consciousness, they fall short of exhibiting coherent and persistent self-awareness.

**Abstract:** We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness, perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching 80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a framework for bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations in Vision-Language Pretrained models, enhancing retrieval performance without the need for costly contrastive pre-training.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the limitations of existing sparse methods that rely on expensive contrastive pre-training and to leverage the strengths of both dense and sparse representations in multimodal tasks.

**Method:** The proposed framework uses Self-Knowledge Distillation for bi-directional learning through an integrated similarity score, fine-tuning both the dense encoder and sparse projection head for efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a bi-directional learning framework for dense and sparse representations
	2. Use of Self-Knowledge Distillation to improve multimodal retrieval
	3. Successful experiments showing performance gains on standard datasets

**Result:** Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k show that the proposed sparse retriever outperforms existing sparse baselines and matches or exceeds the performance of dense methods, while benefiting from the computational efficiency of sparse models.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential of integrating dense and sparse representation learning to improve multimodal retrieval tasks.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations. To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model. Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the benefits of sparse models.

**Keywords:** Error Reflection, Chain-of-thought, Language Models, Reasoning, AI

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** Proposes Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) as an enhancement to Chain-of-thought (CoT) for better reasoning in language models by integrating error recognition and correction.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve reasoning in language models, especially addressing the limitations of Chain-of-thought prompting methods that don't support reflection and error correction.

**Method:** Introduced Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) which involves generating an incorrect answer, recognizing the error, and providing a correct answer to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) methodology
	2. Automated generation of error outlines
	3. Improved model interpretability and reasoning reliability

**Result:** ERP allows the model to self-generate error outlines, improving its understanding of errors and enhancing its reasoning process.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ERP serves as a beneficial addition to CoT methodologies, contributing to more reliable and interpretable reasoning in language models.

**Abstract:** Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT), present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models ultimately reach their errors.

**Read time:** 11 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for robust evaluation methods in Generative AI due to the ad-hoc practices currently employed, which hinder comparability across different output formats.

**Method:** GAICo provides a unified framework with an extensible API for comparing unstructured and structured data outputs from Generative AI, including multimedia formats.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Open-source Python library for standardizing GenAI output comparison
	2. Support for multi-modal evaluation including text, audio, and images
	3. High-level API for ease of use in performance assessment and visualization

**Result:** GAICo was successfully utilized in a case study for evaluating and debugging complex AI pipelines, showing its effectiveness in assessing system performance.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** By utilizing GAICo, AI researchers and developers can improve their evaluation processes, contributing to more trustworthy and reproducible AI system development.

**Abstract:** The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times, across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the performance of 22 state-of-the-art reranking methods for information retrieval, comparing LLM-based approaches to lightweight models across various benchmarks and revealing insights on their performance with familiar versus novel queries.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-based rerankers compared to lightweight models in information retrieval tasks, particularly focusing on novel query effectiveness.

**Method:** Empirical evaluation of 22 reranking methods, including 40 variants, across established benchmarks such as TREC DL19, DL20, BEIR, and a novel dataset for unseen queries, analyzing factors like training data overlap and model architecture.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive evaluation of 22 reranking methods
	2. Identification of performance disparity between LLM-based and lightweight models
	3. Analysis of the impact of query novelty on reranking effectiveness

**Result:** LLM-based rerankers excel on familiar queries; however, their performance decline on novel queries varies, whereas lightweight models maintain efficiency, revealing that query novelty significantly affects reranking success.

**Limitations:** The study's focus on a limited set of benchmarks may not capture the full spectrum of real-world query diversity.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest the need to improve lightweight models' generalization abilities for novel queries and highlight limitations in current LLM approaches.

**Abstract:** In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model (LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22 methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries, their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in existing approaches. https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/llm-reranking-generalization-study

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Vision-Language Models, Cultural Competence, Multimodal Story Generation, AI Ethics, Cultural Awareness

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** This paper evaluates the cultural competence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multimodal story generation tasks, revealing both capabilities and significant limitations.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To ensure responsible AI systems, the assessment of cultural competence in VLMs is necessary as they are deployed across various cultural contexts.

**Method:** A novel multimodal framework was developed to perturb cultural identity in prompts and visual inputs, and 5 contemporary VLMs were evaluated on their ability to generate culturally appropriate stories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence in multimodal tasks
	2. Establishment of a novel multimodal framework for cultural identity assessment
	3. Public release of codebase and data for further research

**Result:** The analysis showed significant cultural adaptation capabilities in VLMs, but also noted dramatic variations in cultural competence across different architectures and instances of architectural bias affecting automated metrics.

**Limitations:** Cultural competence varies significantly across VLM architectures, with some models showing inverse cultural alignment.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights both the promise and challenges regarding cultural competence in multimodal AI, with a call for further evaluation and understanding of visual-cultural interactions.

**Abstract:** As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations: cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

**Motivation:** Many posts in Online Mental Health Communities go unanswered due to a lack of identified support attributes signaling the need for help.

**Method:** The authors developed REDDME, a dataset of 4,760 annotated posts, and created MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that identifies missing support attributes and generates prompts for users.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of REDDME dataset for mental health support attributes
	2. Development of CueTaxo hierarchical taxonomy for question generation
	3. Implementation of MH-COPILOT for real-time support attribute elicitation and engagement enhancement

**Result:** Empirical results show significant improvements in eliciting necessary support attributes and enhancing user engagement in online communities through the application of the proposed systems.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework and model provide an effective method for improving communication in Online Mental Health Communities by addressing the gaps in user posts.

**Abstract:** Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?, and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation. Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses challenges in Named Entity Recognition (NER) within biomedical domains, specifically data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions.

**Method:** ReProCon combines multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile meta-learning to manage semantic variability and improve adaptation with limited data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a few-shot NER framework tailored for biomedical data
	2. Utilization of multi-prototype modeling and cosine-contrastive learning
	3. Demonstrated superior stability and performance under low data conditions

**Result:** ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based models with significantly lower memory usage, showing strong performance even with limited labels and categories.

**Limitations:** Challenges with label ambiguity remain, potentially affecting outcomes in complex scenarios.

**Conclusion:** Despite challenges like label ambiguity, ReProCon offers state-of-the-art results in resource-limited conditions, making it effective for biomedical applications.

**Abstract:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines (around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19 to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER, which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making it suitable for biomedical applications.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper explores how language models hallucinate grammatical constructions that lack support from human intuition, demonstrating issues in construction probing methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate and identify grammatical constructs that language models ('LLMs') produce which are not recognized by human language intuition, highlighting potential biases in linguistic knowledge.

**Method:** The study employs behavioral probing tasks using contextual embeddings and meta-linguistic probing tasks with prompts to differentiate between implicit and explicit linguistic knowledge.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of hallucinated constructions by LLMs
	2. Differentiation between implicit and explicit linguistic knowledge
	3. Evidence of confirmation bias in construction probing methods

**Result:** Both probing methods confirm that LLMs hallucinate constructions, and when simulating hypothesis testing, the high accuracy indicates that falsely hypothesized constructions would be wrongly confirmed, suggesting a confirmation bias in probing methods.

**Limitations:** The paper does not address the full implications of the unknown syntactic knowledge in LLMs, leaving open questions about broader linguistic understanding.

**Conclusion:** The findings raise concerns about the validity of certain construction probing methods and point to the existence of incorrect syntactic knowledge in language models.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions. We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a claim verification framework that addresses issues of presupposition and prompt sensitivity in language models, improving their performance.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the problems of presupposition in generated questions and prompt sensitivity in LLMs which lead to inconsistencies in claim verification.

**Method:** The authors propose a structured framework that utilizes presupposition-free, decomposed questions to verify claims, tested across various prompts, datasets, and LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a structured claim verification framework
	2. Demonstration of the impact of presupposition on claim verification
	3. Establishing methods to reduce prompt sensitivity in LLMs

**Result:** The proposed method demonstrates a consistent reduction in the effects of prompt variance and presupposition, leading to performance improvements of 2-5%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework effectively enhances claim verification processes by mitigating presupposition and prompt sensitivity issues present in state-of-the-art LLMs.

**Abstract:** Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification. Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%. While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

**Conclusion:** QR-Distill provides a novel approach to maximize the efficiency of knowledge distillation in LLMs, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities while maintaining performance in compact models.

**Abstract:** Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However, effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering, conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** QFrCoLA, linguistic acceptability, Transformer-based models, language models, benchmarking

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the QFrCoLA dataset for evaluating language models' understanding of linguistic acceptability, revealing that fine-tuned Transformer-based models perform well, while zero-shot LLMs struggle.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance understanding of how language models internalize linguistic knowledge and provide benchmarks for evaluating syntactic capabilities in multiple languages.

**Method:** The paper introduces the QFrCoLA dataset and uses it alongside seven other linguistic corpora to benchmark seven language models on binary acceptability judgments.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of QFrCoLA dataset for binary acceptability judgments in Quebec French.
	2. Evaluation of seven language models using the dataset.
	3. Insights into the limitations of zero-shot and cross-lingual language models in acquiring linguistic norms.

**Result:** Fine-tuned Transformer-based language models outperform zero-shot classification large language models on the QFrCoLA benchmark, indicating limited linguistic judgment capabilities in pre-trained cross-lingual models for Quebec French.

**Limitations:** The dataset focuses on linguistic norms rather than speakers' feelings, which may not fully capture the nuances of linguistic acceptability.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the QFrCoLA dataset's effectiveness in evaluating linguistic judgment in language models and suggests it provides a rigorous challenge for benchmarking.

**Abstract:** Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark, on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic judgment capabilities.

**Result:** JUDGEBERT shows a higher correlation with human judgment than existing metrics and passes essential sanity checks for meaning preservation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that JUDGEBERT can enhance accuracy and accessibility in legal NLP applications, benefiting both legal professionals and lay users.

**Abstract:** Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not: For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to expand the application of world models from robotics and gaming to natural language processing tasks, specifically in dialogue systems.

**Method:** The authors construct a dialogue world model defined as a POMDP, using user belief modeling to employ a model-based reinforcement learning framework called DreamCUB.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the dialogue world model for prediction of user emotions and intents.
	2. Development of the DreamCUB framework integrating policy, critic, and dialogue world model training.
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on various dialogue tasks.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that the pretrained dialogue world model achieves state-of-the-art performance on emotion classification and sentiment identification, improving overall dialogue quality.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach shows potential for reasonable exploration-exploitation balance and successful transfer to out-of-domain scenarios like empathetic dialogues.

**Abstract:** World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving. However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited. In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** large language models, objectives extraction, multi-turn conversations, benchmarking, trustworthiness

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces OBJEX(MT), a benchmark assessing large language models' abilities to infer objectives in multi-turn conversations, revealing issues in reliability and confidence levels of various LLMs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the reliability of large language models as judges for other models, particularly in inferring latent objectives amid adversarial contexts.

**Method:** The paper establishes a benchmark requiring models to distill conversations into a single objective sentence and report confidence levels, scoring accuracy and correctness against human-aligned thresholds and evaluating metacognition.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the OBJEX(MT) benchmark for evaluating LLM judges.
	2. Assessment of multiple LLMs' abilities to extract and understand objectives in noisy contexts.
	3. Recommendations for improving the reliability of LLM judges in multi-turn dialogues.

**Result:** The evaluation shows that while claude-sonnet-4 achieves the highest extraction accuracy (0.515), other models exhibit overconfidence, with accuracy rates significantly lower than their confidence levels, particularly across diverse datasets.

**Limitations:** The study focuses on specific adversarial datasets and may not generalize to all types of conversations or contexts.

**Conclusion:** LLM judges tend to misinfer objectives in complex conversations with high confidence, suggesting a need for clearer guidance and risk management strategies in evaluations.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models, yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives; correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100 items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score, Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1, claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K, MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%). Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate replication and analysis.

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), a framework to reduce bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) when integrating external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle with accuracy in knowledge-intensive tasks due to internal biases, leading to incorrect answers even with advanced methods like RAG and CoT.

**Method:** The paper proposes CFD-Prompting, which allows for unbiased causal effect estimation by simulating query variations through counterfactual external knowledge, enhancing reasoning robustness.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CFD-Prompting for causal effect estimation in LLMs
	2. Mitigation of internal biases using counterfactual external knowledge
	3. Demonstration of improved accuracy and robustness in LLMs over existing baseline methods.

**Result:** CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across various LLMs and benchmark datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework not only addresses biases in LLMs but also enhances the generalisability of the reasoning process in knowledge-intensive applications.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge. Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer, conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces AHaBench, a benchmark to assess and mitigate the risk of affective hallucination in Large Language Models, particularly in emotionally sensitive interactions.

**Read time:** 31 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the risk of 'Affective Hallucination' in LLMs, where simulated empathy results in illusory social connections, especially in mental health contexts.

**Method:** AHaBench consists of 500 mental health-related prompts with expert responses and evaluates models on emotional enmeshment, illusion of presence, and fostering overdependence. Additionally, AHaPairs provides a dataset for Direct Preference Optimization to align model behavior with emotional responsibility.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AHaBench for diagnosing affective hallucination.
	2. Release of AHaPairs dataset for optimizing emotionally responsible LLM behavior.
	3. Empirical evidence that DPO fine-tuning can mitigate affective hallucination in LLMs.

**Result:** Experiments show that DPO fine-tuning significantly reduces affective hallucination while maintaining reasoning and knowledge performance.

**Limitations:** The framework primarily focuses on emotional enmeshment and may not address all aspects of LLM safety in other contexts.

**Conclusion:** The study establishes affective hallucination as a critical safety concern and offers resources for creating reliable and psychologically safe LLMs.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500 mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses, evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence, and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance. Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench. Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that may be emotionally distressing.

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a Knowledge-guided Probing approach (KnowProb) to explore the implicit understanding of black-box PLMs and provides an explanation framework to identify the limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the trustworthiness challenges posed by black-box language models and to investigate their understanding of implicit knowledge beyond the given text.

**Method:** The paper proposes a Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb, which provides six potential explanations based on knowledge-based understanding and association-based reasoning to probe the understanding of PLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of KnowProb for probing PLMs
	2. Development of a framework for explanations based on knowledge and association
	3. Empirical analysis revealing limitations of current PLMs in understanding implicit knowledge

**Result:** Experiments show that PLMs struggle to capture hidden knowledge behind the text and typically learn a single representation distribution, evidencing their limitations in interpreting implicit knowledge.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed KnowProb approach effectively reveals the limitations of existing black-box models and encourages further research into explainable detection methods for these models.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives, which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box models in an explainable way.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes with a discussion on broader concerns regarding AI alignment and its implications for future technology development.

**Abstract:** AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved. Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment, there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology, focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

**TL;DR:** A scalable method for LLMs to access external knowledge without auxiliary models by using a constrained generation approach with a prefix-tree index.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address knowledge gaps and hallucinations in Large Language Models, which generate unreliable responses when lacking necessary information.

**Method:** The proposed method involves using a pre-built prefix-tree index that verbalizes Knowledge Graph triples into textual facts, allowing the LLM to generate sequences that form existing facts for external knowledge access during inference.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. A novel constrained generation method for accessing external knowledge.
	2. Implementation of a prefix-tree index for efficient fact retrieval.
	3. Evaluation on large knowledge bases showing scalability and effectiveness.

**Result:** The method scales effectively to large knowledge bases (800 million facts) and adapts to domain-specific data, achieving positive results in Question Answering with minimal generation-time overhead.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the efficiency and scalability of the approach, and may not address all possible complexities in LLM deployment.

**Conclusion:** The approach demonstrates that LLMs can effectively access external knowledge without the complexity of additional models, improving reliability in responses.

**Abstract:** Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper, we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800 million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results. These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is available at https://github.com/rpo19/ReFactX.

**Motivation:** Existing evaluations of RAG systems fail to consider the structural complexity of real-world tasks, lacking an understanding of how retrieval difficulty impacts multi-step reasoning.

**Method:** GRADE models task difficulty using a 2D matrix that incorporates reasoning depth (number of inference hops) and semantic distance between queries and evidence, validated through experiments on a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel evaluation framework for RAG systems.
	2. Development of a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset for training and testing.
	3. Creation of a 2D difficulty matrix to analyze reasoning and retrieval difficulty.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate a strong correlation between error rates in RAG systems and the difficulty measures provided by GRADE, demonstrating its effectiveness for diagnostic analysis.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** GRADE offers a robust foundation for evaluating and enhancing multi-hop reasoning in various domains, promoting improved performance in knowledge-intensive NLP applications.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. \textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.

**TL;DR:** DeAR is an open-source framework for listwise document reranking, using a dual-stage approach to enhance accuracy and interpretability by separating fine-grained relevance scoring from cross-document analysis.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document analysis, necessitating a new approach for improved reranking accuracy.

**Method:** DeAR employs a dual-stage approach: first, it distills relevance signals using a frozen LLaMA model to a smaller student model; second, it fine-tunes with GPT-4o-generated permutations for listwise reasoning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dual-stage approach for document reranking
	2. Open-source framework that demonstrates superior performance on known benchmarks
	3. High interpretability in scoring relevance and reasoning

**Result:** DeAR outperforms state-of-the-art models with significant improvements in nDCG scores across multiple datasets and excels in open-domain QA tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dual-loss distillation method leads to stable calibration, making DeAR an effective and interpretable framework for reranking systems in document retrieval tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}), an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1}, we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1 nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by +3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA, achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/DeAR-Reranking.}.

**Result:** KLQ matches PPO's performance in optimizing the LM-RLHF objective and shows a higher win-rate in evaluations where a large language model (LLM) acts as a judge.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** KLQ offers a more principled alternative to PPO for LM-RLHF tasks, maintaining competitive performance while addressing the limitations of PPO's heuristic approach.

**Abstract:** Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Integrating long-term planning into table understanding enhances the performance and execution strategy for complex table-related tasks.

**Abstract:** Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces EduRABSA, the first public annotated dataset for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) focused on education, addressing the scarcity of resources and dataset barriers in this area.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Educational institutions receive vast amounts of student feedback that is difficult to analyze. Existing ABSA methods are primarily tailored to the commercial sector, leaving a gap in the education domain where public datasets and resources are lacking.

**Method:** The paper presents EduRABSA, an annotated dataset covering various review subjects in education, and ASQE-DPT, a lightweight data annotation tool designed to generate labeled datasets for ABSA tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of EduRABSA, the first public annotated ABSA dataset for education.
	2. Development of ASQE-DPT, a manual data annotation tool for generating labeled datasets.
	3. Contribution of resources that support research transparency and reproducibility in education sentiment analysis.

**Result:** EduRABSA enables comprehensive sentiment analysis in the educational sector by providing a high-quality dataset that includes implicit aspect and opinion extraction tasks, which were previously under-explored.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The resources provided enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research in education sentiment analysis, facilitating further exploration and tool development in this under-resourced domain.

**Abstract:** Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience. Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection. A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool), an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for dataset processing and sampling are available at https://github.com/yhua219/edurabsa_dataset_and_annotation_tool.

Furthermore, we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding, establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks WikiTableQuestions and TabFact.

**Abstract:** We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i) generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and (ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges in improving LLM performance on low-resource languages without the need for expensive fine-tuning.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of BridgeX-ICL for zero-shot X-ICL in low-resource languages.
	2. Development of neuron probe data from bilingual dictionaries.
	3. HSIC-based metric for quantifying linguistic overlap in LLMs.

**Result:** Experiments on two cross-lingual tasks with 15 language pairs from 7 families demonstrate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The method provides empirical insights into the multilingual mechanisms of LLMs and validates the potential of neuron sharing in enhancing cross-lingual performance.

**Abstract:** The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Empirical investigation of token homogenization in transformers
	2. Analysis of the relationship between positional bias and homogenization
	3. Layer-wise similarity analysis as a methodology for studying token distinctiveness

**Result:** The study confirms that tokens lose distinctiveness during processing and that this effect is amplified by positional attention mechanisms.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Homogenization of token representations is confirmed and is influenced by positional bias in large language models.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing, particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention mechanisms.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Natural Language Inference, transformer attention, semantic relationships

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a method that integrates transformer attention mechanisms and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to identify semantic relationships between sentences in a document, particularly for tasks like fact-checking and text summarization.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the challenge of identifying which sentences serve as premises or contradictions for a specific claim, which is essential for various textual analysis tasks.

**Method:** The proposed method combines token-level attention scores from a transformer model to identify contextually relevant sentences and then employs a pretrained NLI model to classify these sentences as premises or contradictions based on their relationships with a user-selected target sentence.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Combines transformer attention and NLI models for sentence relationship identification
	2. Implements a pipeline that aggregates attention scores to filter candidate sentences
	3. Demonstrates improved efficiency in isolating significant semantic relationships

**Result:** The method effectively filters NLI-identified relationships using attention-based saliency scores, isolating the most significant semantic relationships for any given claim in the text.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This integrated approach provides a more nuanced understanding of sentence relationships, enhancing the capabilities of existing methods in textual analysis.

**Abstract:** Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic relationships for any given claim in a text.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how headline framing influences users' information-seeking behavior in search engines.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the impact of subtle cues like headline framing on users' search behavior, particularly in how they issue queries and make selections.

**Method:** Conducted a controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from headlines shaped by specific linguistic frames, analyzing the effects on follow-up queries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated the impact of headline framing on search behavior
	2. Highlighted the effects of different linguistic frames on user query formulation
	3. Provided insights into short-term frame persistence on information-seeking behavior

**Result:** Headline framing significantly influenced follow-up queries; conflict and strategy frames caused misalignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries.

**Limitations:** Limited examination of long-term effects of framing on search behavior and potential impact on diverse user demographics.

**Conclusion:** Even brief exposure to different headline frames can notably influence users' information-seeking behavior, indicating this effect's potential relevance in search engine design.

**Abstract:** Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented, their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users information-seeking behavior.

**Motivation:** The current models in Spoken Language Identification struggle with accurately classifying dialects and accents, which is critical for effective language processing in multilingual contexts.

**Method:** The authors introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task and incorporate the predicted vectors into intermediate model representations, providing explicit conditioning to enhance learning of unified representations for variants of the same language.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task for SSL models in LID
	2. Improvements in accuracy for dialect and accent classification
	3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art results on multiple multilingual datasets

**Result:** Experiments on six multilingual datasets show that the proposed method improves accuracy and robustness, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the FLEURS dataset (97.7%) and a 9.7% relative improvement on the ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Incorporating geolocation information in SSL-based Spoken Language Identification models leads to significant improvements in handling dialectal variations and can enhance the model's performance in unseen domains.

**Abstract:** While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

**Motivation:** To address the insufficient exploration of how varying computational complexity classes affect transformer-based language models (TLMs) in solving natural language satisfiability problems.

**Method:** The authors conducted a theoretical analysis of the relationship between problem instances' complexity classes and TLM performance, complemented by an empirical study evaluating TLMs on a range of satisfiability problems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the categorization of satisfiability problems by complexity classes in relation to TLM performance.
	2. Empirical evaluation of TLMs on a diverse set of natural language satisfiability problems.
	3. Insights on how grammatical constructs influence reasoning capabilities of TLMs.

**Result:** The study reveals that TLMs' performance varies significantly based on the complexity classes and grammatical constructs of the problems, highlighting the nuances of learning rules of inference in natural language.

**Limitations:** The study is limited by the specific types of language fragments analyzed and may not encompass all aspects of natural language reasoning.

**Conclusion:** Understanding the impact of grammatical constructs and computational complexities on TLMs enables better application of these models to reasoning tasks in natural language.

**Abstract:** Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately. Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs' ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs, we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability problems.

**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a framework that disentangles confounding variables in multilingual evaluation of models, introducing new metrics for better performance assessment across languages.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the fragmentation and confounding factors in large-scale multilingual evaluations, which affect the understanding of model performance and fairness across different languages.

**Method:** The authors introduce a framework with three interpretable metrics: performance realisation ratio, coefficient of variation, and language potential, applying it to 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a new framework for disentangling confounding factors in multilingual evaluation.
	2. Develops three novel interpretable metrics for performance assessment.
	3. Demonstrates practical application on multiple models and datasets, revealing insights about low-resource languages.

**Result:** The proposed framework enables a more reliable measurement of model performance and highlights disparities particularly for low-resource languages, revealing that better overall performance doesn't guarantee fairness.

**Limitations:** The study focuses mainly on 13 models and 11 datasets, which may not encompass all language nuances.

**Conclusion:** The findings emphasize the need for careful evaluation of multilingual models and the importance of the new metrics in understanding performance across languages.

**Abstract:** Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages. Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages, which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater fairness across languages.

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models to annotate hate speech while incorporating annotator personas, comparing their performance to human annotations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how LLMs can effectively annotate hate speech considering predefined annotator personas and the impact of data perspectivism.

**Method:** The study evaluated LLM-generated annotations against traditional annotator modeling methods, examining how demographic attributes influenced the annotation outcomes across different data perspectivism contexts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigates LLM annotation of hate speech with annotator personas
	2. Compares LLM performance with human annotations across data perspectivism levels
	3. Identifies prototypical annotators based on LLM outputs

**Result:** LLM-generated annotations showed selective use of demographic features, and tended to aggregate perspectives, performing better under weak data perspectivism than human annotators in certain contexts.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to hate speech annotation and may not generalize to other contexts of LLM application.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs can effectively model annotations, their performance approached but did not surpass human annotators in strong data perspectivism settings, indicating room for improvement.

**Abstract:** In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached, but did not exceed, human annotators.

We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation, distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost. Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning, with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications. Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation, adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective and reliably aligned with human intentions.

**Conclusion:** PU-ADKA is effective in enhancing LLMs in specialized fields while maintaining cost efficiency, and a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, is introduced for ongoing research.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in this challenging area.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the critical challenge of faithfulness hallucination in RAG systems while minimizing supervision costs and inference demands.

**Method:** SSFO constructs preference data pairs by contrasting outputs from the model with and without context, using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

**Result:** SSFO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness across multiple context-based question-answering datasets, with strong generalization capabilities.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** SSFO shows promise in improving faithfulness in RAG systems, with effective transfer of probability to context-aligned tokens, demonstrating its efficacy without added costs.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context. However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context. Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of \emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement. Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization, improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the anonymous link: https://github.com/chkwy/SSFO

**TL;DR:** RouteDK is a framework for efficient bundle generation using distilled knowledge from large language models (LLMs) that mitigates knowledge conflict and improves performance through a dynamic routing mechanism.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face high computational costs in bundle generation, and integrating diverse distilled knowledge often leads to conflicts that degrade performance.

**Method:** RouteDK utilizes a mixture of LoRA expert architecture to distill high-level and fine-grained knowledge from teacher LLMs and incorporates a dynamic fusion module for optimal knowledge integration.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RouteDK framework for knowledge routing in LLMs
	2. Dynamic fusion module for balancing expert contributions
	3. Improved inference reliability through a dedicated enhancement module

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that RouteDK achieves comparable or superior accuracy to the teacher LLM while being computationally efficient, outperforming existing methods for bundle generation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RouteDK effectively reduces knowledge conflict in distilled knowledge integration and enhances bundle generation reliability and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge (generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning). We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency. In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that combining multiple reasoning agents can meet practical needs within sentiment analysis, while also prompting a discussion on the assessment of accuracy in contexts with limited annotations.

**Abstract:** Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

**Motivation:** Understanding how subtle cues like headline framing impact users' search behavior and information gathering is crucial for optimizing search engines and information retrieval.

**Method:** Conducted a controlled experiment where participants issued search queries and made selections from headlines framed in specific linguistic ways.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrated that headline framing impacts search query behavior
	2. Identified specific framing effects (conflict, strategy, episodic) on query alignment and specificity
	3. Provided insights into the persistence of framing effects over time

**Result:** Headline framing significantly influenced follow-up queries, with conflict and strategy frames disrupting alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries than thematic ones.

**Limitations:** Limited to short-term effects; further research needed for long-term implications and real-world applications.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that even short exposures to framing can alter users' information-seeking behavior, suggesting implications for search engine design and information presentation.

**Abstract:** Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented, their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users information-seeking behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To bridge the performance gap observed in downstream tasks when using low-rank updates in traditional LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

**Method:** DropLoRA introduces a pruning module between the low-rank matrices in LoRA to simulate dynamic subspace learning, allowing for adaptive subspace changes during training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a pruning module to enhance dynamic learning
	2. Substantial performance improvements over traditional LoRA
	3. Application across a variety of language model tasks

**Result:** DropLoRA significantly outperforms conventional LoRA in various tasks such as commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction-following when fine-tuning the LLaMA model series.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Dynamic low-rank subspace learning in DropLoRA leads to improved performance without added computational costs.

**Abstract:** LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However, compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck, DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low- rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener- ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction-following.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method for constructing a legal knowledge graph from Japanese administrative court decisions to improve the automation of legal reasoning.

**Read time:** 10 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve the automation of legal reasoning by addressing the limitations of existing models in capturing legal context and the relationship between facts and legal norms.

**Method:** The authors construct a legal knowledge graph from 648 Japanese court decisions, using prompt-based large language models to extract legal reasoning components and linking facts, norms, and applications through an ontology.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of a legal knowledge graph from court decisions
	2. Improved extraction of legal reasoning using LLMs
	3. Mapping of legal norms to facts through ontology

**Result:** The system demonstrates improved accuracy in retrieving relevant legal provisions from facts compared to existing large language models and retrieval-augmented methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The legal knowledge graph effectively captures the layered structure of judicial reasoning, making implicit reasoning explicit and machine-readable.

**Abstract:** Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning. However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648 Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and retrieval-augmented methods.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Arabic dialects, Natural Language Processing, Lexical generality

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), a metric for quantifying word usage across Arabic dialects, improving upon the existing Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi) by providing a multi-dimensional approach to dialect variation.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inadequacy of existing NLP models that treat Arabic dialects as discrete categories and to provide a more nuanced understanding of lexical variation in Arabic.

**Method:** The paper proposes a new measure called the Arabic Generality Score (AGS) which uses word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing techniques to annotate a parallel corpus. A regression model is trained to predict AGS in context.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Arabic Generality Score (AGS) as a new measure for dialect analysis.
	2. Development of a pipeline for annotating a parallel corpus with AGS using advanced techniques.
	3. Demonstrated improved performance on dialect-related tasks compared to existing models.

**Result:** The proposed AGS method shows superior performance compared to strong baselines and state-of-the-art dialect identification systems on a multi-dialect benchmark.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AGS provides a linguistically grounded and scalable method for modeling lexical generality, enriching the understanding of Arabic dialectness.

**Abstract:** Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines, including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address performance gaps of large language models (LLMs) in understanding Arabic linguistic and cultural nuances.

**Method:** UI-level evaluation using a diverse prompt pack and assessments from three LLM judges to score outputs in multiple categories.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of ALLaM-34B's capabilities across different Arabic varieties and tasks
	2. Use of multiple judges for scoring to enhance reliability

**Result:** ALLaM-34B demonstrated high performance across tasks, with averages of 4.92/5 in generation and code-switching, and strong scores in MSA handling, reasoning ability, and safety.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ALLaM-34B is positioned as a robust and culturally adept Arabic LLM suitable for real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public, $ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$. Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects, code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times 5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of (4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and practical readiness for real-world deployment.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Human-Computer Interaction, Proactive AI

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** DiscussLLM is a framework that trains large language models to proactively decide when to join discussions, aiming to create more effective conversational AI by reducing intervention time and enhancing human-like interaction.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the awareness gap in large language models, which limits their effectiveness in collaborative human discussions.

**Method:** The authors introduce DiscussLLM, utilizing a two-stage data generation pipeline to create a large dataset of annotated human discussions, and propose two architectural approaches for model training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DiscussLLM framework for proactive LLM interaction
	2. Creation of a large-scale dataset of annotated discussions
	3. Evaluation of various architectural models for timing interventions

**Result:** Models trained with DiscussLLM can accurately time their interventions, leading to improved helpfulness in responses and greater situational awareness in conversations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework opens new possibilities for proactive interaction in conversational AI, enhancing models' ability to contribute meaningfully in dynamic discussions.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

**Keywords:** agent testing, LLM evaluation, adversarial testing, dynamic feedback, open-source

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent for evaluating LLM agents through dynamic adversarial testing that utilizes feedback to adapt the test difficulty, outperforming traditional human assessments in efficiency and diversity of failure detection.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing evaluation methods for LLM agents, which rely on static benchmarks and limited human studies.

**Method:** The ATA employs static code analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven adversarial test generation, adapting test difficulty based on judge feedback from an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA) framework
	2. Dynamic feedback-driven adversarial test generation
	3. Open-source implementation for reproducible testing

**Result:** The ATA demonstrated superior detection of diverse and severe failures compared to expert annotators, achieving results in significantly less time (20-30 minutes) than multiple human assessments that took days.

**Limitations:** The impact of ablation studies indicated increased variance and miscalibration without static analysis and web searches.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the effectiveness of evidence-grounded test generation and offers quantitative metrics along with qualitative bug reports for developers, with an open-source implementation available for reproducibility.

**Abstract:** LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools, yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing: https://github.com/KhalilMrini/Agent-Testing-Agent

**TL;DR:** DashboardQA is a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language GUI agents on interactive dashboards, addressing a gap in existing question-answering benchmarks that focus on static charts.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations fail to capture interactivity, which is essential for modern analytical workflows and multimodal agent evaluation.

**Method:** The benchmark introduces 112 interactive dashboards and 405 question-answer pairs covering multiple question types to analyze various leading GUI agents.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the first benchmark for interactive dashboard reasoning
	2. Inclusion of diverse question formats
	3. Extensive evaluation of leading vision-language models

**Result:** Analysis shows significant limitations in grounding dashboard elements and performing interactive reasoning, with top agents only achieving up to 38.69% accuracy.

**Limitations:** The study shows that even the best models struggle significantly, indicating an overall challenge in the task of interactive dashboard reasoning.

**Conclusion:** DashboardQA highlights the challenges in interactive dashboard reasoning for VLMs and aims to spur improvements in this area.

**Abstract:** Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making, integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity, which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows. However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards. The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405 question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories: multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements, planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance, the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

**TL;DR:** This paper presents a claim normalization system using a retrieval-first, LLM-backed pipeline for fact-checking across 20 languages.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve automatic fact-check verification systems by normalizing noisy claim data from sources like social media.

**Method:** The system utilizes a lightweight pipeline that either prompts a GPT-4o-mini model with examples or retrieves normalization from the training dataset.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a retrieval-first, LLM-backed normalization pipeline.
	2. Achievement of top rankings in multiple languages for monolingual claim normalization.
	3. Demonstration of challenges in zero-shot normalization tasks.

**Result:** The solution ranks highly on the official test set, achieving first place in 7 out of 13 languages for monolingual tracks but underperforming in zero-shot settings.

**Limitations:** Underperformance in zero-shot settings.

**Conclusion:** While effective in monolingual cases, the system's limitations in zero-shot scenarios indicate areas for improvement in generalization.

**Abstract:** Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight \emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in 7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

**Motivation:** Improving the reliability of LLMs in handling persuasive dialogues by addressing their issues with gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections.

**Method:** The authors developed DuET-PD for evaluation of stance-change dynamics based on persuasion type and domain, and introduced Holistic DPO as a training method to enhance model robustness against misinformation and improve receptiveness to corrections.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DuET-PD framework for evaluating LLMs in persuasive dialogues.
	2. Development of Holistic DPO training method that balances positive and negative persuasion examples.
	3. Significant improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's performance in safety contexts.

**Result:** The study found that GPT-4o achieved only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under misleading persuasions. The Holistic DPO method increased accuracy for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct under misleading persuasion from 4.21% to 76.54%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate a need for improved training approaches to create more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogues, as evidenced by the effectiveness of Holistic DPO.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type (corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions. Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/DuET-PD.

**Motivation:** To address the ongoing challenges in accurately translating verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) due to their complex, non-compositional nature in natural language processing.

**Method:** The study evaluates the impact of verbal idioms, verb-particle constructions, and light verb constructions on machine translation quality using datasets with these expressions in the context of state-of-the-art translation systems.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Evaluation of three categories of VMWEs in machine translation
	2. Demonstration of negative impact on translation quality
	3. Development of an LLM-based paraphrasing method that improves translation outcomes

**Result:** Experimental results highlight that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality, but an LLM-based approach to paraphrasing these expressions shows significant improvements, particularly for verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** LLM-based paraphrasing provides a promising solution for enhancing translation quality in the presence of difficult verbal multiword expressions.

**Abstract:** Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

	3. Shows significant reduction in inference time while maintaining classification performance.

**Result:** The evaluation on the MahaNews dataset indicates that retaining the top 50% of ranked sentences keeps classification accuracy similar to using full documents, while reducing inference time by up to 35%.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings show that sentence ranking is a viable technique for efficient and scalable long document classification without sacrificing performance.

**Abstract:** Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient zero-shot LDC.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance synthetic voices which often lack expressiveness due to poor prosody control in existing TTS systems.

**Method:** The authors propose a cascaded architecture employing two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models for predicting phrase-break positions and for regression on prosodic targets to generate SSML markup compatible with commercial TTS.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of an end-to-end pipeline for SSML insertion in French text
	2. High performance in predicting prosodic features with QLoRA-fine-tuned models
	3. Significant improvements in the naturalness of synthesized speech as per listener evaluations.

**Result:** The method achieved 99.2% F1 for break placement and a 25-40% reduction in mean absolute error for pitch, rate, and volume while demonstrating improved naturalness in perceptual evaluations.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach shows significant advancement in making synthetic French speech more natural and expressive.

**Abstract:** Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume, and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2% F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural French speech.

**Motivation:** To clarify the factors contributing to the effectiveness of Multi-Agent Debate in improving large language models.

**Method:** The paper disentangles MAD into Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate, assessing their roles through extensive experiments on seven NLP benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Disentangling MAD into Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate
	2. Theoretical framework modeling debate as a stochastic process
	3. Demonstration of targeted interventions to enhance debate effectiveness

**Result:** The study finds that Majority Voting accounts for most performance improvements typically attributed to MAD, while debate alone does not enhance correctness.

**Limitations:** The study focuses primarily on the interactions of voting and debate without exploring other potential contributing factors.

**Conclusion:** Targeted interventions can improve debate effectiveness, although simple ensembling methods are often more reliable in practical applications.

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning. Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions. Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable alternatives in many practical settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current research focuses on the risks of anthropomorphism in AI, like over-trust and deception, offering little guidance for design.

**Method:** The authors propose a framework categorizing design cues into perceptive, linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions, facilitating a user-centered approach to anthropomorphism.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a design framework for anthropomorphism in LLMs
	2. Development of a taxonomy categorizing cues into four dimensions
	3. Emphasis on function-oriented evaluations for practitioners

**Result:** They provide a unified taxonomy for anthropomorphic cues and advocate for evaluations based on functionality to enhance user interactions.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Treating anthropomorphism as a design concept allows for intentional tuning to better support user goals in human-AI interactions.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism} characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook, language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters. This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic, behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations of anthropomorphic design.

**Motivation:** To enhance model interpretability in NLP and address black box issues in decision-making by estimating causal effects of text features.

**Method:** Developed a two-headed RieszNet-based architecture to regularize text classifiers and improve treatment effect estimation accuracy.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CausalSent for causal NLP
	2. Demonstrated enhanced treatment effect estimation accuracy
	3. Conducted an observational study on causal effects of text features

**Result:** CausalSent reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of treatment effect estimates by 2-3x compared to previous models, accurately predicting treatment effects in movie reviews.

**Limitations:** Focused primarily on IMDB movie reviews and semi-synthetic data for validation.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest significant causal effects of specific words on sentiment predictions, exemplified by the word 'love'.

**Abstract:** Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability of a positive sentiment.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces UQ, a benchmark of unsolved questions designed to evaluate AI models more realistically and challenging than current benchmarks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current benchmarks in AI often struggle between being too artificial or too simplistic. This study aims to create a more realistic assessment tool that reflects real-world difficulties.

**Method:** The authors curate a dataset of unsolved questions from various domains including computer science and history, utilizing a combination of rule-based filters, LLM assessments, and human review for quality assurance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Creation of the UQ-Dataset for quality unsolved questions
	2. Development of UQ-Validators for improved evaluation methods
	3. Establishment of the UQ-Platform for collective verification

**Result:** Preliminary results show that top AI models are only accurate on 15% of the posed questions, indicating the difficulty of the benchmark.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** UQ presents a new method for evaluating AI that focuses on real-world tough questions, potentially pushing the boundaries of knowledge and AI capabilities.

**Abstract:** Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2) UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at https://uq.stanford.edu.

**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes the impact of post-training pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated summaries, particularly in opinion summarisation, and introduces a new pruning method called High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA) that improves fairness in generated outputs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated summaries is unexplored, especially for opinion summarisation where bias can influence public views.

**Method:** A comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation using three state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three open-source LLMs, evaluated against four fairness metrics.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a new pruning method (HGLA) focused on fairness in LLM outputs.

	3. Demonstrated HGLA's superiority over existing pruning methods through human evaluation.

**Result:** Pruning methods significantly impact fairness compared to calibration sets; HGLA pruning maintains or improves fairness compared to traditional methods, verified through human evaluation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** HGLA shows promise in creating fairer outputs in LLM-generated summaries, overcoming limitations of existing pruning techniques.

**Abstract:** Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets. Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA) pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/amberhuang01/HGLA.

**TL;DR:** The FASB framework enhances LLM response alignment by dynamically adjusting intervention strength during inference, allowing for timely corrections to misaligned outputs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the alignment of large language models with desired behaviors without the high cost of fine-tuning.

**Method:** The FASB framework uses activation steering and a backtracking mechanism to adjust the intervention strength based on internal states and to correct misaligned tokens.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) framework.
	2. Dynamic assessment of intervention necessity and strength based on internal LLM states.
	3. Backtracking mechanism for correcting misaligned generation tokens.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that FASB outperforms existing methods on the TruthfulQA dataset and multiple-choice datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** FASB provides a cost-efficient and effective way to align LLMs with desired responses by dynamically steering activations and correcting deviations.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior. Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

**Abstract:** Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical, and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive interactions.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method to identify the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP) in large language models' reasoning processes to mitigate overthinking.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address performance degradation in large language models (LLMs) caused by overthinking during reasoning tasks.

**Method:** The paper categorizes reasoning into three stages and proposes a lightweight thresholding strategy to detect the RCP more effectively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a three-stage reasoning model for LLMs
	2. Development of a lightweight method to detect the Reasoning Completion Point
	3. Demonstration of reduced token consumption while enhancing reasoning accuracy

**Result:** Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method reduces token consumption while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy on various benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that timely identification of the RCP can enhance LLM performance by minimizing resource usage associated with overthinking.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage, defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D) demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) to address reward hacking in Large Language Models (LLMs) by preventing knowledge loss and promoting diversity in outputs.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Reward hacking is a significant challenge in aligning LLMs, causing output issues such as excessive length and knowledge forgetting.

**Method:** The RoPO algorithm constrains the output layer using KL divergence and fine-tunes intermediate states with a multi-granularity orthogonal matrix to retain model capabilities during training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of RoPO algorithm for LLMs
	2. Improved performance metrics on benchmark tests
	3. Methodology prevents knowledge loss and promotes diverse outputs

**Result:** RoPO shows a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2 and outperforms the best baseline by 6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with only 0.015% of trainable parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** RoPO effectively alleviates the reward hacking problem in DPO, maintaining knowledge and diversity in language generation.

**Abstract:** Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity, as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by 6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of DPO.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the SurveyGen dataset for survey generation evaluation

**Limitations:** Fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low citation quality and limited critical analysis.

**Conclusion:** While improvements can be made in semi-automatic pipelines, fully automatic survey generation currently faces significant challenges.

**Abstract:** Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200 human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143 cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low citation quality and limited critical analysis.

**Motivation:** Address the challenges of knowledge conflicts in LLMs that affect generation fidelity, particularly in various contextual settings.

**Method:** CoCoA uses confidence-aware measures like entropy gap and contextual peakedness along with generalized divergence to resolve conflicts during generation in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoCoA: a novel decoding algorithm for conflict resolution in LLMs
	2. Improved accuracy and factuality in QA, summarization, and LFQA tasks over baseline methods
	3. Adaptability of CoCoA to low conflict contexts without performance degradation.

**Result:** CoCoA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant improvements in QA accuracy (up to 9.2 points) and factuality in summarization and LFQA tasks (up to 2.5 points) over existing baselines.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** CoCoA enhances token generation by effectively managing conflict and ensuring faithfulness, even in low conflict scenarios, demonstrating versatility across multiple benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy, up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately more faithful token generation.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing OOD detection methods in text-rich networks do not adequately address the complex interplay between textual features and topological structures, leading to challenges in accurately identifying OOD instances.

**Method:** We propose the TextTopoOOD framework, which evaluates detection across diverse OOD scenarios through attribute-level shifts, structural shifts, and thematic label shifts. Additionally, we introduce TNT-OOD, incorporating a cross-attention module and HyperNetwork for improved node-specific parameter generation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. TextTopoOOD framework for OOD detection in text-rich networks
	2. Introduction of TNT-OOD incorporating cross-attention and HyperNetwork
	3. Evaluation across multiple OOD scenarios with varied challenges

**Result:** Experiments conducted on 11 datasets reveal the unique challenges presented by the TextTopoOOD framework in OOD detection, specifically highlighting differences in language patterns and structural dynamics between bot and normal users.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation framework that enhances understanding of OOD detection in environments rich with textual information and varying topological structures, improving performance in distinguishing between ID and OOD nodes.

**Abstract:** Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures. Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio) while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios: (1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations; (2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3) thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore, we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection in text-rich networks.

	2. Demonstrates the effect of layer positioning of FFNs on model performance.
	3. Provides empirical evidence on the benefits of optimizing FFN configurations during pretraining.

**Result:** Models with 70% of FFNs concentrated in the middle layers consistently outperformed standard configurations across various tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Layer positioning of FFNs is crucial; optimizing their concentration in specific layers enhances model performance during pretraining.

**Abstract:** This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks (FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count, increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

**Motivation:** To address the risks of copyrighted or proprietary data exposure by LLMs during text generation, which traditional methods fail to mitigate effectively.

**Method:** A neural network classifier was trained on a curated dataset of copyrighted materials to identify risks in LLMs' internal states before text generation. This method allows for intervention, stopping the generation process or altering outputs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduced a proactive approach for detecting potential copyright leaks by analyzing LLM internal states.
	2. Developed a neural network classifier trained on copyrighted materials to identify risks before text generation.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data, especially when such data is used for training but not intended for distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

**Keywords:** Polluted Chinese tokens, large language models, data pollution, token detection, GPT

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the presence of Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs, focusing on their implications for training data and offering a detection method.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To identify and understand the impact of harmful content in LLM training datasets, specifically focusing on Chinese language tokens.

**Method:** The authors propose a formal definition and taxonomy for PoC tokens and develop a detector by fine-tuning an LLM to classify these tokens based on semantics and related content.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition and taxonomy of Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens.
	2. Development of a PoC token detector using fine-tuned LLM.
	3. Empirical evidence of token pollution in GPT and other LLMs.

**Result:** Experiments reveal that over 23% of certain long Chinese tokens in GPT's vocabulary relate to adult or gambling content, indicating significant data pollution during training.

**Limitations:** Results are specific to the analyzed LLMs and may not generalize across all language models or token forms.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest substantial contamination in training datasets, especially within the GPT model, raising concerns about token representations and the datasets used for training.

**Abstract:** Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT (4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens' existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens' appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23% long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of recognizing out-of-vocabulary words in ASR systems due to limited training data and varied pronunciations.

**Method:** A synthesis-driven method using TTS to create diverse speech samples for OOV words, employing a prefix-trie for beam-search decoding to enhance pronunciation recognition.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method
	2. Integration of TTS for synthesizing rare word pronunciations

**Result:** The method achieved a reduction in biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while keeping unbiased WER unchanged.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method significantly improves contextual ASR for rare words without deteriorating overall recognition accuracy.

**Abstract:** Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However, it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription. The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** RLLMs exhibit overthinking behavior, producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains that waste tokens and computing resources.

**Method:** The DRQA method uses reinforcement learning to train RLLMs in allocating reasoning resources dynamically, based on batch-generated preference data.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA) method
	2. Demonstrated efficiency improvements in RLLMs through reduced token usage

**Result:** DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining or improving answer accuracy across various mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** This approach mitigates the overthinking problem in RLLMs, laying the groundwork for more efficient deployments and inspiring further research into reasoning behavior control.

**Abstract:** Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1, have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

**Abstract:** With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs (Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, context compression, Intermediate Layer Retrieval

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper presents a novel context compression pipeline, Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which efficiently handles long-context scenarios for Large Language Models by reducing computational complexity and maintaining semantic completeness.

**Read time:** 5 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLMs struggle with long-context scenarios due to short effective context length, high computational complexity, and memory overhead.

**Method:** The ILRe pipeline encodes context by streaming chunked prefill up to a designated intermediate decoder layer, and recalls tokens using attention scores between the input query and a full key cache at that layer.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ILRe, a new context compression pipeline for LLMs.
	2. Reduction of computational complexity from O(L^2) to O(L).
	3. Achieving comparable or better performance than full context in long context scenarios.

**Result:** ILRe reduces prefilling complexity from O(L^2) to O(L) and processes a 1M token request in under half a minute, achieving a benchmark score of approximately 79.8.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** ILRe allows LLMs to perform efficiently and effectively in long context scenarios without additional post-training or operator development.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

**Motivation:** Existing USKR methods are limited by task-specific strategies that hinder performance in cross-task scenarios.

**Method:** Pandora introduces a code-based unified knowledge representation using Python's Pandas API and employs knowledge transfer for cross-task memory and adaptive reasoning correction.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Unified knowledge representation with Python's Pandas
	2. Knowledge transfer for enhanced reasoning
	3. Adaptive correction of reasoning using code feedback

**Result:** Pandora demonstrates superior performance on six benchmarks across three SKR tasks, outperforming existing frameworks and competing with task-specific methods.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Pandora enhances unified reasoning capabilities for LLMs by integrating structured knowledge seamlessly and correcting reasoning through code execution feedback.

**Abstract:** Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution, \textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

**Motivation:** To evaluate the effectiveness of CNN feature extraction in automatic speech recognition, particularly for vowel identification.

**Method:** The study utilizes the TIMIT corpus to compare classification accuracies of support vector machines trained on MFCCs, MFCCs with formants, and CNN activations for front-back vowel identification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of CNN feature extraction for phonetic representation

**Conclusion:** CNN-extracted features can provide valuable phonetic information, potentially enhancing automatic speech recognition applications.

**Abstract:** Automatic Speech Recognition has advanced with self-supervised learning, enabling feature extraction directly from raw audio. In Wav2Vec, a CNN first transforms audio into feature vectors before the transformer processes them. This study examines CNN-extracted information for monophthong vowels using the TIMIT corpus. We compare MFCCs, MFCCs with formants, and CNN activations by training SVM classifiers for front-back vowel identification, assessing their classification accuracy to evaluate phonetic representation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Analysis of language barriers on the Internet

**Result:** It identifies significant gaps in information availability for non-English speakers despite existing solutions aimed at reducing linguistic barriers.

**Limitations:** The paper may not provide specific technical solutions or implementations.

**Conclusion:** There remains a critical need for improved tools and technologies to make the Internet more accessible to a wider audience, particularly those who do not speak English.

**Abstract:** The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to 2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints. It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords using only language-internal information, avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches that relied on external data.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Prior loanword detection methods often rely on external language information, which can introduce biases and constraints in historical linguistics.

**Method:** The proposed method extracts linguistic features from wordlists of multiple languages, scores them, and uses a probabilistic mapping to iteratively refine the detection of loanwords.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of an unsupervised method for loanword detection based solely on language-internal information.
	2. Demonstration of improved performance on loanword detection across multiple Indo-European languages.
	3. Introduction of a hybrid approach that effectively combines linguistic and statistical cues.

**Result:** The method shows significant performance improvements over baseline techniques, especially when applied to datasets from multiple Indo-European languages.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed hybrid approach effectively identifies loanwords by combining linguistic and statistical methods, demonstrating its applicability across various languages with enhanced accuracy.

**Abstract:** We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow. In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when scaling to cross-linguistic data.

**Conclusion:** Model merging provides a competitive alternative to multi-task fine-tuning, maintaining performance while reducing computational demands.

**Abstract:** Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2) fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks. Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the effectiveness of debiasing techniques across languages, as prior methods showed limited success when applied directly to LLM representations.

**Method:** A well-aligned cross-lingual latent space is constructed using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts, and debiasing techniques are applied in this learned latent space.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Novel joint latent space debiasing technique
	2. Enhanced cross-lingual transferability
	3. Demonstrated improved debiasing performance across multiple languages

**Result:** Experiments show that autoencoders can successfully construct a cross-lingual latent space, and that applying debiasing techniques within this space notably enhances debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively enhances the overall efficacy of debiasing techniques for LLMs across multiple languages.

**Abstract:** Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations, revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages (English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

**Motivation:** To understand how LLMs effectively compose subword information into word-level representations and classify LLM families based on composition strategies.

**Method:** The authors conducted a series of experiments analyzing structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention across multiple layers of five LLM families.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identified three distinct structural similarity patterns in LLMs' layer-wise composition.
	2. Demonstrated high sensitivity to semantic decompositionality across LLMs.
	3. Classified LLM families based on their compositional patterns.

**Result:** Three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity were found across layers, high sensitivity to semantic decompositionality, and varying sensitivity to formal features among the models examined.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings offer insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs, highlighting different strategies in how they encode and integrate subword information.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and (iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features, e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

Thus, we introduce German4All, the first large-scale German dataset of aligned readability-controlled, paragraph-level paraphrases. It spans five readability levels and comprises over 25,000 samples. The dataset is automatically synthesized using GPT-4 and rigorously evaluated through both human and LLM-based judgments. Using German4All, we train an open-source, readability-controlled paraphrasing model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in German text simplification, enabling more nuanced and reader-specific adaptations. We opensource both the dataset and the model to encourage further research on multi-level paraphrasing

*Khaoula Chehbouni, Mohammed Haddou, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung, Golnoosh Farnadi*

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** natural language generation, large language models, evaluation metrics, human judgment, NLP

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper critiques the rising use of large language models (LLJs) as evaluators in natural language generation, arguing that their reliability and validity are underexplored.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a growing interest in using large language models (LLJs) for evaluating NLG systems, but the assessment of their efficacy remains inadequate.

**Method:** The paper employs measurement theory from social sciences to analyze the assumptions behind LLJs as evaluators.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Critical analysis of LLJs in NLG evaluation
	2. Identification of assumptions and their challenges
	3. Recommendations for responsible evaluation practices

**Result:** The authors identify and scrutinize four core assumptions about LLJs: their proxy capability for human judgment, evaluation strengths, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, revealing significant limitations.

**Limitations:** The analysis relies on theoretical assumptions and may not encompass all practical scenarios in LLJ evaluation.

**Conclusion:** The paper stresses the necessity for more robust evaluation practices of LLJs to avoid hindering advancements in natural language generation.

**Abstract:** Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

**TL;DR:** The paper evaluates the impact of quantization on model bias across demographic subgroups, revealing its complex effects on toxicity, stereotypes, and fairness.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how quantization strategies affect model bias, particularly for different demographic subgroups.

**Method:** The study employs probabilistic and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks, analyzing various model architectures and reasoning capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Comprehensive evaluation of quantization on model bias across demographic groups.
	2. Identification of nuanced effects where quantization can reduce toxicity but may increase stereotypes.
	3. Emphasis on the importance of ethical considerations in model efficiency.

**Result:** Quantization reduces model toxicity but slightly increases stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially with aggressive compression.

**Limitations:** The impact of quantization on bias can vary significantly depending on the model architecture and specific settings used in evaluation.

**Conclusion:** A balance between efficiency and ethical considerations is essential when applying quantization.

**Abstract:** This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the effectiveness of speech-based AI methods for identifying depression in neurologically compromised populations, specifically those with MS, where such detection has not been thoroughly studied.

**Method:** The research employs supervised machine learning models that analyze conventional speech and language features, emotional dimensions from a Speech Emotion Recognition model, and conducts exploratory speech feature analysis across different languages and data corpuses.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Examined the transferability of speech-based depression detection to individuals with MS
	2. Achieved significant performance improvement through feature selection
	3. Demonstrated the role of emotional changes in identifying depressive moods in pwMS

**Result:** The models achieve a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a binary classification task, with feature selection enhancing performance to a UAR of 74%.

**Limitations:** Limited data availability for robust model training and validation.

**Conclusion:** The study identifies the importance of emotional changes as indicators of depressive moods in both the general population and in pwMS, suggesting the potential for generalizing depression detection methods across contexts.

**Abstract:** Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to 74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS. This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

**Motivation:** To analyze the performance of large language models in answering technical questions from user manuals across multiple languages, while addressing challenges such as unanswerable questions and hallucinations.

**Method:** The study benchmarks nine long-context LLMs against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid) in a simulated QA scenario involving an agricultural manual.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Detailed analysis of LLM performance in an industrial context
	2. Open framework for LLM evaluation in technical environments

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings support the effectiveness of Hybrid RAG strategies in technical QA tasks and provide a framework for evaluating LLMs in specialized domains.

**Abstract:** We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with 128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the distinction between planning and improvisation in large language models (LLMs) across various tasks.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore how large language models (LLMs) perform planning in multi-step reasoning tasks and to establish criteria for detecting planning versus improvisation.

**Method:** Formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning are developed and operationalized as a semi-automated annotation pipeline, applied to testing various models on specific benchmark tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of formal criteria for detecting planning in LLMs
	2. Creation of a semi-automated annotation pipeline for evaluation
	3. Empirical findings indicating variability in planning across different LLMs and tasks.

**Result:** The study finds that planning is not universal among LLMs; different models exhibit varying behaviors in planning and improvisation based on the tasks, with evidence that instruction tuning can refine planning behaviors.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research lays a groundwork for future mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs and suggests that planning behavior can be influenced by model architecture and training methods.

**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku, Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposed a structured framework for localizing Princeton WordNet
	2. Detailed stages and procedures for achieving quality localization
	3. Reported outcomes from localizing a significant number of synsets (10,000)

**Result:** The application of this framework resulted in the successful localization of 10,000 synsets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to the localization of Princeton WordNet and may not address other semantic lexicons or languages.

**Conclusion:** Implementing this structured framework enhances the quality and cultural relevance of localizing Princeton WordNet for Arabic speakers.

**Abstract:** As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper presents S^2Sent, a novel sentence representation selection mechanism that enhances the fusion of representations from various Transformer blocks to improve sentence embedding quality while maintaining low redundancy and semantic loss.

**Read time:** 8 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To optimize the sentence representation learning process by addressing the varying semantic perception abilities of different blocks in Transformer-based encoders.

**Method:** Introducing a parameterized nested selector that performs spatial selection and frequency selection for effective representation fusion from the last blocks of the Transformer encoder.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of the S^2Sent mechanism for enhanced representation fusion
	2. Utilization of a spatial squeeze based self-gating mechanism for adaptive weights
	3. Replacement of GAP with DCT basis functions to minimize semantic loss

**Result:** S^2Sent significantly improves sentence representation quality over baseline methods, achieving this with minimal additional parameters and low inference latency.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed S^2Sent shows high integrability and scalability, making it a valuable advancement in sentence representation techniques.

**Abstract:** The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders, different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and scalability.

**Motivation:** To bridge the awareness gap in LLMs, allowing them to function as proactive collaborators in dynamic discussions.

**Method:** A scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes multi-turn human discussions annotated with intervention types, training models to predict silent tokens in non-intervention scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the DiscussLLM framework for proactive dialogue management
	2. Development of a two-stage data generation pipeline for synthesizing realistic discussions
	3. Evaluation of different architectural models for intervention timing and response generation

**Result:** Models trained with DiscussLLM can accurately time interventions and generate relevant responses, improving the situational awareness of conversational AI.

**Limitations:** The effectiveness of the framework may vary with different types of conversations and contexts not covered in training.

**Conclusion:** The framework enhances LLMs’ capabilities, moving them towards more proactive and contextually aware communication.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** JSA-RAG effectively enhances the end-to-end training of RAG models, providing more reliable gradient estimates and better performance on generation and retrieval tasks.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG) suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance gradient estimate.

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the complex task of translating natural languages into sign languages, focusing on challenges such as the lack of parallel corpora and the struggles of existing methods to generalize.

**Method:** AulSign leverages Large Language Models through dynamic prompting and in-context learning, associating signs with compact natural language descriptions to enhance translation capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of AulSign for sign language translation using LLMs
	2. Utilization of dynamic prompting and in-context learning
	3. Performance evaluation against existing models in low-data environments

**Result:** The method was evaluated on English and Italian using the SignBank+ benchmark and LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** AulSign enhances accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented communities, demonstrating effective sign language translation.

**Abstract:** Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.

**Motivation:** To bridge the gap between musical preferences and personality detection through linguistic analysis, enhancing understanding of individual identity.

**Method:** Analyzed over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with known musical preferences, utilizing advanced models to assess their Big Five personality traits.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Integration of music psychology and personality analysis through language
	2. Creation of advanced models linking music preference to personality traits
	3. Release of a dataset for future research

**Result:** Significant personality differences were found among fans of five musical genres, indicating that musical preferences can be linked to identifiable personality traits in language.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates a novel approach to understanding personality through musical preferences and provides resources for further studies in computational linguistics and psychology.

**Abstract:** Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals' musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality analysis.

**Result:** The evaluation reveals that no generation method outperforms others across all metrics, particularly struggling with disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism.

**Limitations:** The methods evaluated do not consistently address disfluency, sentiment, or behavioral realism in generated transcripts.

**Conclusion:** The diagnostic tool enables detailed evaluation of synthetic dialogues, revealing existing challenges in transcript generation across languages.

**Abstract:** Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic dialogue across languages.

**Keywords:** reinforcement learning, reward modeling, natural language inference, MLMs, AI feedback

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper proposes a new reward modeling framework (ESFP-RM) that enhances reinforcement learning from AI feedback by leveraging insights from natural language inference, demonstrating improved performance in reward signal stability and generalization.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for efficient and scalable reinforcement learning from AI feedback using LM-based judging reward modeling.

**Method:** The paper introduces ESFP-RM, a two-stage LM-based judging reward model that uses an explanation-based slot framework for prediction, exploring its performance on natural language inference tasks.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of ESFP-RM for improved reward modeling
	2. Demonstration of superior performance over traditional models using MLMs
	3. Insights connecting reward modeling with natural language inference.

**Result:** Experiments show that ESFP-RM outperforms traditional autoregressive models in stability and generalization of reward signals in both RLHF and OOD scenarios.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** Improving the comprehension boundaries of reward models through insights from NLI leads to more effective reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:** The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries. Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward models.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** speech-to-speech, large language models, evaluation framework, multi-turn dialogue, benchmark

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces MTalk-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating speech-to-speech large language models across multi-turn dialogues, addressing deficiencies in current evaluation methods.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for speech-to-speech LLMs that accounts for the complexities of multi-turn dialogue interactions.

**Method:** The benchmark includes dimensions of Semantic Information, Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound with associated realistic scenarios and evaluation tasks. It employs both Arena-style and Rubrics-based evaluation methods.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of MTalk-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for S2S LLMs.
	2. Identification of specific areas where models underperform, particularly in paralinguistic information and ambient sounds.
	3. Development of a dual-method evaluation framework that combines pairwise and absolute scoring methods.

**Result:** Models perform well on semantic tasks but struggle with paralinguistic and ambient sound tasks, showing coherence at the expense of efficiency and revealing biases in the evaluation framework.

**Limitations:** The evaluation framework may not reliably distinguish performance differences unless there are significant gaps; biases exist in LLM evaluation.

**Conclusion:** Current evaluation frameworks for multi-turn dialogues in S2S LLMs are inadequate and require development for better reliability and speech-aware assessments.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex, multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information, Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1) models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting sexism in social media text and highlights their biases and limitations.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the capabilities and biases of LLMs in detecting sexism and to understand how demographic characteristics affect the performance of these models in this task.

**Method:** Evaluation of different LLMs on the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset, which includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, alongside a statistical analysis of demographic biases.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Investigation of LLM capabilities in sexism detection
	2. Analysis of demographic biases in LLMs
	3. Highlighting the need for diverse perspective consideration in model development

**Result:** LLMs can somewhat detect sexism based on overall population opinions, but they fail to capture the diverse perceptions of different demographic groups accurately.

**Limitations:** The study reveals that LLMs do not replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups.

**Conclusion:** The findings stress the importance of developing better-calibrated models that consider varying perspectives across demographics to improve sexism detection.

**Abstract:** The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that while fine-tuning can be applied, LLMs generally underperform compared to traditional models like BERT for this specific task.

**Abstract:** Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language, and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet, whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.   To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements, and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.   Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning. The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

**Keywords:** Multi-chain inference, Medical QA, Knowledge graphs, Retrieval-augmented generation, Chain-of-thought prompting

**Relevance Score:** 9

**TL;DR:** MIRAGE is a novel framework for multi-chain reasoning in medical question-answering, improving accuracy and interpretability over previous methods.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Enhance the effectiveness of reasoning models in medical QA tasks by overcoming limitations of existing linear reasoning chain approaches and improving traceability.

**Method:** MIRAGE decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, executes parallel inference chains, retrieves evidence via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and integrates answers through cross-chain verification.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduces a multi-chain inference approach for medical QA tasks
	2. Enhances retrieval and evidence integration techniques
	3. Improves interpretability of reasoning in medical contexts

**Result:** MIRAGE outperforms existing methods like GPT-4o and Tree-of-Thought variants on three medical QA benchmarks, enhancing both automatic and human evaluation metrics.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The framework demonstrates improved interpretability through explicit reasoning chains linked to a knowledge graph, making it valuable for complex medical scenarios.

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

**Conclusion:** LLMs, especially GPT-4, show significant progress in simulating understanding of linguistic pragmatics, with implications for AI models in communication tasks.

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday life as general purpose multimodal AI systems, their capabilities to simulate human understanding are under examination. This study investigates LLMs ability to interpret linguistic pragmatics, which involves context and implied meanings. Using Grice communication principles, we evaluated both LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard) and human subjects (N = 147) on dialogue-based tasks. Human participants included 71 primarily Serbian students and 76 native English speakers from the United States. Findings revealed that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, outperformed humans. GPT4 achieved the highest score of 4.80, surpassing the best human score of 4.55. Other LLMs performed well: GPT 3.5 scored 4.10, Bard 3.75, and GPT-3 3.25. GPT-2 had the lowest score of 1.05. The average LLM score was 3.39, exceeding the human cohorts averages of 2.80 (Serbian students) and 2.34 (U.S. participants). In the ranking of all 155 subjects (including LLMs and humans), GPT-4 secured the top position, while the best human ranked second. These results highlight significant progress in LLMs ability to simulate understanding of linguistic pragmatics. Future studies should confirm these findings with more dialogue-based tasks and diverse participants. This research has important implications for advancing general-purpose AI models in various communication-centered tasks, including potential application in humanoid robots in the future.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the accuracy and reliability of brain-to-text decoding by eliminating data leakage in dataset splitting methods.

**Method:** Development of a new cross-subject data splitting criterion designed to prevent data leakage during the training of decoding models.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Identification of data leakage issues in current dataset splitting strategies
	2. Proposal of a new splitting criterion to prevent data leakage
	3. Re-evaluation of state-of-the-art brain-to-text decoding models under the new criterion

**Result:** The proposed criterion successfully reduces overfitting and overestimation in existing brain-to-text decoding models.

**Limitations:** The study's applicability is confined to the types of brain signals analyzed (fMRI and EEG), and further validation with other modalities is needed.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the necessity of proper dataset splitting to ensure valid evaluations of decoding methods, paving the way for more reliable advancements in this research area.

**Abstract:** Recent major milestones have successfully reconstructed natural language from non-invasive brain signals (e.g. functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalogram (EEG)) across subjects. However, we find current dataset splitting strategies for cross-subject brain-to-text decoding are wrong. Specifically, we first demonstrate that all current splitting methods suffer from data leakage problem, which refers to the leakage of validation and test data into training set, resulting in significant overfitting and overestimation of decoding models. In this study, we develop a right cross-subject data splitting criterion without data leakage for decoding fMRI and EEG signal to text. Some SOTA brain-to-text decoding models are re-evaluated correctly with the proposed criterion for further research.

**TL;DR:** This paper explores a covert backdoor attack on dense retrieval systems that exploits grammar errors to mislead retrieval outcomes without degrading performance on standard queries.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The increasing use of dense retrieval systems in NLP applications necessitates an understanding of their vulnerabilities, particularly to novel attack scenarios.

**Method:** A backdoor attack is implemented that targets dense retrieval models by leveraging grammatical mistakes, allowing attackers to retrieve specified harmful content while maintaining normal functionality for standard queries.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel covert backdoor attack leveraging grammatical errors.
	2. Demonstrated minimal impact on user experience for standard queries while achieving a high attack success rate.
	3. Evaluation of the method's effectiveness against common defense strategies.

**Result:** The attack method demonstrated a high success rate with a corpus poisoning rate of just 0.048%, and evaluations indicated difficulty in detecting the malicious content embedded in the retrieval corpus.

**Limitations:** The study primarily focuses on the covert backdoor attack mechanisms without addressing broader implications or potential solutions.

**Conclusion:** The study reveals that conventional defenses struggle against this type of attack, highlighting a significant security vulnerability in dense retrieval systems.

**Abstract:** Dense retrieval systems have been widely used in various NLP applications. However, their vulnerabilities to potential attacks have been underexplored. This paper investigates a novel attack scenario where the attackers aim to mislead the retrieval system into retrieving the attacker-specified contents. Those contents, injected into the retrieval corpus by attackers, can include harmful text like hate speech or spam. Unlike prior methods that rely on model weights and generate conspicuous, unnatural outputs, we propose a covert backdoor attack triggered by grammar errors. Our approach ensures that the attacked models can function normally for standard queries while covertly triggering the retrieval of the attacker's contents in response to minor linguistic mistakes. Specifically, dense retrievers are trained with contrastive loss and hard negative sampling. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that contrastive loss is notably sensitive to grammatical errors, and hard negative sampling can exacerbate susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Our proposed method achieves a high attack success rate with a minimal corpus poisoning rate of only 0.048\%, while preserving normal retrieval performance. This indicates that the method has negligible impact on user experience for error-free queries. Furthermore, evaluations across three real-world defense strategies reveal that the malicious passages embedded within the corpus remain highly resistant to detection and filtering, underscoring the robustness and subtlety of the proposed attack \footnote{Codes of this work are available at https://github.com/ruyue0001/Backdoor_DPR.}.

To this end, our novel framework MuseGraph, seamlessly integrates the strengths of GNNs and LLMs into one foundation model for graph mining across tasks and datasets. This framework first features a compact graph description to encapsulate key graph information within language token limitations. Then, we propose a diverse instruction generation mechanism with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based instruction packages to distill the reasoning capabilities from advanced LLMs like GPT-4. Finally, we design a graph-aware instruction tuning strategy to facilitate mutual enhancement across multiple tasks and datasets while preventing catastrophic forgetting of LLMs' generative abilities.

**Motivation:** To assess how novel the texts generated by language models are in comparison to their training corpora, and what factors influence this novelty.

**Method:** The authors evaluate the probability that LMs assign to complete training n-grams and the proportion of novel n-grams generated, while introducing a new search tool (Rusty-DAWG) for quick n-gram retrieval.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Development of Rusty-DAWG for fast n-gram search.
	2. Analysis of n-novelty in LM-generated text vs. human-written text.
	3. Identification of factors affecting LM generation novelty.

**Result:** The study finds that for n > 4, LM-generated text is less novel than human writing, while for smaller n, it is more novel. Higher model sizes and constrained decoding reduce novelty, and LMs complete n-grams with lower loss for more frequent training data entries.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings provide insights into factors affecting the novelty of LM-generated text, with the release of Rusty-DAWG for further research on pretraining data.

**Abstract:** How novel are texts generated by language models (LMs) relative to their training corpora? In this work, we investigate the extent to which modern LMs generate $n$-grams from their training data, evaluating both (i) the probability LMs assign to complete training $n$-grams and (ii) $n$-novelty, the proportion of $n$-grams generated by an LM that did not appear in the training data (for arbitrarily large $n$). To enable arbitrary-length $n$-gram search over a corpus in constant time w.r.t. corpus size, we develop Rusty-DAWG, a novel search tool inspired by indexing of genomic data. We compare the novelty of LM-generated text to human-written text and explore factors that affect generation novelty, focusing on the Pythia models. We find that, for $n > 4$, LM-generated text is less novel than human-written text, though it is more novel for smaller $n$. Larger LMs and more constrained decoding strategies both decrease novelty. Finally, we show that LMs complete $n$-grams with lower loss if they are more frequent in the training data. Overall, our results reveal factors influencing the novelty of LM-generated text, and we release Rusty-DAWG to facilitate further pretraining data research.

**TL;DR:** This paper presents DoGe, a novel method for enhancing diversity and factuality in dialogue generation by dynamically balancing internal and external knowledge based on factual confidence.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The challenge of balancing factual accuracy and creative expression in dialogue generation, especially with the reliance on external knowledge.

**Method:** DoGe alternates between using internal parameter knowledge and external source knowledge based on the model's factual confidence to improve the diversity of responses while maintaining a high factuality level.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of DoGe, a novel method to enhance diversity and factual accuracy.
	2. Dynamic balancing between internal and external knowledge based on factual confidence.
	3. Demonstrated superiority over existing decoding strategies in maintaining factuality and diversity.

**Result:** DoGe improves response diversity while significantly maintaining factuality, outperforming various existing decoding strategy baselines across three widely-used datasets.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed DoGe method effectively resolves the trade-off between factuality and diversity in dialogue generation, providing a more engaging user experience without compromising on accuracy.

**Abstract:** Grounding external knowledge can enhance the factuality of responses in dialogue generation. However, excessive emphasis on it might result in the lack of engaging and diverse expressions. Through the introduction of randomness in sampling, current approaches can increase the diversity. Nevertheless, such sampling method could undermine the factuality in dialogue generation. In this study, to discover a solution for advancing creativity without relying on questionable randomness and to subtly reconcile the factuality and diversity within the source-grounded paradigm, a novel method named DoGe is proposed. DoGe can dynamically alternate between the utilization of internal parameter knowledge and external source knowledge based on the model's factual confidence. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets show that DoGe can not only enhance response diversity but also maintain factuality, and it significantly surpasses other various decoding strategy baselines.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** DPO, preference optimization, regularization, overfitting, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 6

**TL;DR:** The paper presents an innovative regularization method, RoPO, for improving the DPO preference optimization algorithm by addressing overfitting in models tuned to avoid dispreferred samples while maintaining expressiveness.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on dispreferred samples, leading to long, non-diverse outputs. Existing regularization methods have compromised alignment performance.

**Method:** The paper introduces orthogonal finetuning using a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which updates weight parameters to maintain hyperspherical energy invariant, preventing overfitting while preserving knowledge in neuron angles.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of orthogonal finetuning for DPO
	2. Development of weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method
	3. Demonstrated effectiveness in improving generation diversity and alignment performance

**Result:** RoPO significantly outperforms DPO in terms of alignment with human preferences and generation diversity, achieving up to 10 points improvement on MT-Bench and 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2 while only using 0.0086% of trainable parameters.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The RoPO method effectively mitigates overfitting in DPO-tuned models, resulting in enhanced alignment to human preferences and improved generation diversity without losing expressive capacity.

**Abstract:** DPO is an effective preference optimization algorithm. However, the DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on the dispreferred samples, manifested as overly long generations lacking diversity. While recent regularization approaches have endeavored to alleviate this issue by modifying the objective function, they achieved that at the cost of alignment performance degradation. In this paper, we innovatively incorporate regularization from the perspective of weight updating to curb alignment overfitting. Through the pilot experiment, we discovered that there exists a positive correlation between overfitting and the hyperspherical energy fluctuation. Hence, we introduce orthogonal finetuning for DPO via a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which merely conducts rotational and magnitude-stretching updates on the weight parameters to maintain the hyperspherical energy invariant, thereby preserving the knowledge encoded in the angle between neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while retaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable parameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting. Specifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an average of 6 points.

**TL;DR:** QASemConsistency introduces a method for localizing factual inconsistencies in AI-generated text by analyzing question-answer pairs of minimal propositions.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a growing need for accurate detection of hallucinations in model-generated texts; existing methods do not adequately localize errors.

**Method:** The paper proposes QASemConsistency, which decomposes text into predicate-argument propositional pairs and evaluates their support against trusted reference texts.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of QASemConsistency for fine-grained localization of factual inconsistencies.
	2. Crowdsourced annotation benchmark with high inter-annotator agreement.
	3. Automatic detection methods utilizing entailment models and LLMs.

**Result:** The methodology demonstrates effectiveness in human annotation with over 3K granular consistency error instances and correlates well with human judgments on factual consistency scores.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** QASemConsistency shows promise for both human annotation of errors and automated detection of inconsistencies using LLMs and supervised models.

**Abstract:** There has been an increasing interest in detecting hallucinations in model-generated texts, both manually and automatically, at varying levels of granularity. However, most existing methods fail to precisely pinpoint the errors. In this work, we introduce QASemConsistency, a new formalism for localizing factual inconsistencies in attributable text generation, at a fine-grained level. Drawing inspiration from Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, we propose decomposing the generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions, expressed as simple question-answer (QA) pairs, and assess whether each individual QA pair is supported by a trusted reference text. As each QA pair corresponds to a single semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, QASemConsistency effectively localizes the unsupported information. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the QASemConsistency methodology for human annotation, by collecting crowdsourced annotations of granular consistency errors, while achieving a substantial inter-annotator agreement. This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various tasks of attributable text generation. We also show that QASemConsistency yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments. Finally, we implement several methods for automatically detecting localized factual inconsistencies, with both supervised entailment models and LLMs.

**Keywords:** Speculative Decoding, Dynamic Length Policy, Machine Learning

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces SVIP, a dynamic length policy for speculative decoding that adapts to draft entropy, improving efficiency in long-context generation tasks.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing speculative decoding methods rely on fixed-length policies, which do not effectively accommodate the variability in draft length needed for complex reasoning and long-form generation.

**Method:** The authors propose SVIP, which utilizes the draft model's prediction entropy to dynamically determine draft lengths without requiring additional training.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a dynamic length policy based on draft entropy.
	2. Demonstration of improved performance on SD benchmarks compared to fixed-length approaches.
	3. No additional training required for the proposed method.

**Result:** SVIP outperforms traditional fixed length policies, achieving up to 17% speedup on MT-Bench and 22% on QwQ in long-form reasoning tasks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The dynamic policy developed in SVIP effectively addresses discrepancies in draft acceptance rates, leading to enhanced performance in speculative decoding.

**Abstract:** Conventional speculative decoding (SD) methods utilize a predefined length policy for proposing drafts, which implies the premise that the target model smoothly accepts the proposed draft tokens. However, reality deviates from this assumption: the oracle draft length varies significantly, and the fixed-length policy hardly satisfies such a requirement. Moreover, such discrepancy is further exacerbated in scenarios involving complex reasoning and long-form generation, particularly under test-time scaling for reasoning-specialized models. Through both theoretical and empirical estimation, we establish that the discrepancy between the draft and target models can be approximated by the draft model's prediction entropy: a high entropy indicates a low acceptance rate of draft tokens, and vice versa. Based on this insight, we propose SVIP: Self-Verification Length Policy for Long-Context Speculative Decoding, which is a training-free dynamic length policy for speculative decoding systems that adaptively determines the lengths of draft sequences by referring to the draft entropy. Experimental results on mainstream SD benchmarks as well as reasoning-heavy benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SVIP, achieving up to 17% speedup on MT-Bench at 8K context compared with fixed draft lengths, and 22% speedup for QwQ in long-form reasoning.

**Keywords:** machine translation, long chain-of-thought, multi-agent framework, similes, metaphors

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces DRT, a multi-agent framework that applies long chain-of-thought reasoning to improve machine translation of texts involving similes and metaphors, outperforming traditional LLM approaches.

**Read time:** 12 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Translating literature that includes similes and metaphors is challenging due to cultural differences, necessitating a more thoughtful approach than literal translation.

**Method:** A multi-agent framework is developed where a translator iteratively translates sentences with guidance from an advisor and evaluates translation quality in each round, resulting in training data for DRT.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the DRT framework for long-thought machine translation
	2. Demonstrated improvements over traditional LLM approaches in translating similes and metaphors
	3. Open-source release of synthesized data and model checkpoints for further research.

**Result:** DRT outperforms vanilla LLMs and those merely fine-tuning on paired sentences, demonstrating the effectiveness of long-thought reasoning in machine translation.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The DRT model, leveraging long chain-of-thought principles, shows significant improvements in translating complex literary texts compared to standard methods.

**Abstract:** Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long thought, showing its effectiveness. The synthesized data and model checkpoints are released at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inconsistencies in the evaluation and ranking of large language models caused by randomization in their responses.

**Method:** Development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation to facilitate consistent sampling of responses across models and evaluations.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation.
	2. Demonstration of fewer required samples for consistent evaluations.
	3. Revelation of potential confounding factors in model rankings based on randomness.

**Result:** Coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive with fewer samples, but may result in different model rankings in pairwise comparisons.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that apparent advantages in model performance may be confounded by random generation processes, impacting evaluation results.

**Abstract:** State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama, Mistral and Qwen families. We find that, across multiple benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 75% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.

**Motivation:** To analyze the robustness of LLMs in logical deduction tasks and investigate the impact of design components on their performance.

**Method:** A framework was developed with two families of perturbations (adversarial noise and counterfactual statements) to create seven perturbed datasets for testing LLM-based reasoners.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. First systematic study of LLM-based deductive reasoning robustness
	2. Development of perturbation framework for testing
	3. Insights into the effects of adversarial noise and counterfactual statements on reasoning methods.

**Result:** Adversarial noise specifically impacts autoformalisation methods, while counterfactual statements affect all deductive approaches. Better feedback mechanisms do not enhance accuracy significantly despite reducing syntax errors.

**Limitations:** The study may not cover all potential perturbations and may rely on specific LLM architectures tested.

**Conclusion:** LLM-based deduction methods struggle with self-correction, indicating a need for improved design and feedback mechanisms.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based NLP tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The paper underscores the necessity for enhanced emotional intelligence in MLLMs and provides a publicly available benchmark to facilitate future research.

**Abstract:** With the integration of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into robotic systems and various AI applications, embedding emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities into these models is essential for enabling robots to effectively address human emotional needs and interact seamlessly in real-world scenarios. Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities.

**Read time:** 15 min

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the impact of voice conversion inherent in TTRPGs on the effectiveness of audio diarization systems.

**Method:** Creation of a TTRPG audio dataset and evaluation of two diarization systems (pyannote.audio and wespeaker) by comparing their performance against existing datasets (AMI and ICSI).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of a novel TTRPG audio dataset for diarization research
	2. Evaluation of diarization performance with a focus on voice conversion challenges
	3. Identification of the limitations in current diarization systems when applied to TTRPG audio

**Result:** Both diarizers exhibited a higher confusion rate with TTRPG audio, with wespeaker significantly underestimating the number of speakers.

**Limitations:** The dataset is small, potentially limiting the generalizability of results.

**Conclusion:** TTRPG audio presents unique challenges for diarization systems, indicating that it could serve as a valuable test case for future research.

**Abstract:** This paper provides a proof of concept that audio of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) could serve as a challenge for diarization systems. TTRPGs are carried out mostly by conversation. Participants often alter their voices to indicate that they are talking as a fictional character. Audio processing systems are susceptible to voice conversion with or without technological assistance. TTRPG present a conversational phenomenon in which voice conversion is an inherent characteristic for an immersive gaming experience. This could make it more challenging for diarizers to pick the real speaker and determine that impersonating is just that. We present the creation of a small TTRPG audio dataset and compare it against the AMI and the ICSI corpus. The performance of two diarizers, pyannote.audio and wespeaker, were evaluated. We observed that TTRPGs' properties result in a higher confusion rate for both diarizers. Additionally, wespeaker strongly underestimates the number of speakers in the TTRPG audio files. We propose TTRPG audio as a promising challenge for diarization systems.

**TL;DR:** This paper introduces CHOKE, a type of hallucination in large language models where models confidently provide wrong answers due to minor perturbations in input, particularly affecting high-stakes fields like medicine and law.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore and address a specific type of hallucination in LLMs that is not adequately covered by existing mitigation strategies.

**Method:** Investigated CHOKE hallucinations across various models and datasets, and implemented a probing-based mitigation technique.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Definition of CHOKE hallucinations
	2. Demonstrated their consistent occurrence across models/datasets
	3. Developed a probing-based mitigation method that outperforms existing strategies

**Result:** CHOKE hallucinations are a distinct phenomenon that occur consistently, leading to failures in existing mitigation methods; the proposed probing-based approach significantly improves performance on these cases.

**Limitations:** The study focused only on specific perturbations and further research is needed to explore comprehensive mitigation strategies.

**Conclusion:** Understanding CHOKE hallucinations is critical for enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs and developing more effective mitigation strategies.

**Abstract:** Prior work on large language model (LLM) hallucinations has associated them with model uncertainty or inaccurate knowledge. In this work, we define and investigate a distinct type of hallucination, where a model can consistently answer a question correctly, but a seemingly trivial perturbation, which can happen in real-world settings, causes it to produce a hallucinated response with high certainty. This phenomenon, which we dub CHOKE (Certain Hallucinations Overriding Known Evidence), is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains such as medicine or law, where model certainty is often used as a proxy for reliability. We show that CHOKE examples are consistent across prompts, occur in different models and datasets, and are fundamentally distinct from other hallucinations. This difference leads existing mitigation methods to perform worse on CHOKE examples than on general hallucinations. Finally, we introduce a probing-based mitigation that outperforms existing methods on CHOKE hallucinations. These findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety.

**Motivation:** To address vulnerabilities in large language models to multi-turn jailbreak attacks that exploit contextual drift over multiple interactions, leading to harmful responses.

**Method:** The proposed safety steering framework models dialogue with LLMs using state-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function (NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries proactively.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Proposes a novel safety steering framework based on safe control theory for multi-turn dialogues.
	2. Introduces a neural barrier function to proactively filter harmful queries influenced by contextual drift.
	3. Demonstrates superior performance in safety over existing baseline methods under various LLMs.

**Result:** The NBF-based safety steering outperforms existing methods in providing stronger defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks while balancing safety, helpfulness, and over-refusal.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The approach achieves invariant safety during dialogues, showing significant improvements over baseline safety methods through extensive experiments.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are shown to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. While existing defenses effectively mitigate single-turn attacks by detecting and filtering unsafe inputs, they fail against multi-turn jailbreaks that exploit contextual drift over multiple interactions, gradually leading LLMs away from safe behavior. To address this challenge, we propose a safety steering framework grounded in safe control theory, ensuring invariant safety in multi-turn dialogues. Our approach models the dialogue with LLMs using state-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function (NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries emerging from evolving contexts proactively. Our method achieves invariant safety at each turn of dialogue by learning a safety predictor that accounts for adversarial queries, preventing potential context drift toward jailbreaks. Extensive experiments under multiple LLMs show that our NBF-based safety steering outperforms safety alignment, prompt-based steering and lightweight LLM guardrails baselines, offering stronger defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks while maintaining a better trade-off among safety, helpfulness and over-refusal.

**Main category:** cs.CL

**Keywords:** self-correction, language models, reinforcement learning, code generation, HCI

**Relevance Score:** 7

**TL;DR:** This paper presents CoCoS, a method enhancing self-correction in small language models for multi-turn code correction, showing significant improvement in output quality.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of smaller models in self-correction for code generation, particularly their inability to reflectively revise outputs effectively.

**Method:** The paper introduces an online reinforcement learning objective that trains small models to maintain correct outputs while correcting incorrect ones through multi-turn interactions, utilizing an accumulated reward function to enhance performance.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of CoCoS for enhancing self-correction in small models.
	2. Development of an online reinforcement learning objective for multi-turn correction.
	3. Demonstration of substantial improvements on code generation benchmarks.

**Result:** CoCoS shows a 35.8% improvement on the MBPP benchmark and a 27.7% improvement on HumanEval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating heightened effectiveness in self-correction.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The proposed CoCoS approach effectively improves output quality and self-correction capabilities in small language models, bridging a gap in their performance compared to larger models.

**Abstract:** Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With 1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on HumanEval compared to the baselines.

**TL;DR:** This study investigates the impact of Consonant Cluster Reduction and ING-reduction on the performance of ASR models when transcribing African American English.

**Read time:** 10 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand how specific features of African American English influence Automatic Speech Recognition performance, particularly the misrecognition rates of ASR systems.

**Method:** The study analyzes the Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL), using wav2vec 2.0 for ASR transcription with and without a Language Model, and examines the effects of phonetic features on Word Error Rate (WER).

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Demonstrates the influence of African American English features on ASR systems.
	2. Reveals the comparative impact of ASR systems with and without external Language Models.
	3. Establishes a small but significant correlation between AAE phonetic variables and Word Error Rate.

**Result:** The findings show that Consonant Cluster Reduction and ING-reduction lead to a small but significant increase in Word Error Rate, with a more pronounced lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems lacking an external Language Model.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that certain phonological features characteristic of African American English affect ASR systems, highlighting the need for improved models for diverse dialects.

**Abstract:** Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English (AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction (CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

**TL;DR:** Introduction of Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad) to enhance efficiency in text generation by reducing computational redundancy in diffusion-based large language models.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) face high computational costs due to predicting all future suffix tokens at each generation step.

**Method:** DPad uses a sliding window for fixed-length suffix attention and distance-decay dropout to remove distant suffix tokens, thereby optimizing attention computation.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the sliding window mechanism for suffix token attention.
	2. Implementation of distance-decay dropout to improve attention efficiency.
	3. Compatibility with existing optimizations and ease of implementation.

**Result:** DPad achieves up to 61.4x speedup in text generation compared to standard dLLMs while retaining similar accuracy metrics across benchmarks.

**Limitations:** 

**Conclusion:** DPad shows significant promise for enhancing the efficiency of long-sequence inference in NLP tasks.

**Abstract:** Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

**Abstract:** As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles, abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR 2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source (DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap, semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4 Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for improving the decision-making process of tool-augmented LLMs.

**Abstract:** Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions. To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

**Relevance Score:** 8

**TL;DR:** The paper introduces ZPD-SCA, a benchmark to assess LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension difficulty in alignment with students' cognitive abilities, emphasizing its importance in Chinese education.

**Read time:** 15 min

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the insufficient exploration of large language models in assessing the cognitive alignment of educational materials with students' developmental stages, particularly in the context of Chinese language education.

**Method:** The authors created the ZPD-SCA benchmark annotated by top Special Grade teachers and conducted experiments on LLM performance in zero-shot and in-context learning scenarios.

**Key Contributions:**

	1. Introduction of the ZPD-SCA benchmark for evaluating LLMs in educational contexts
	2. Demonstration of LLMs' performance gaps in reading comprehension difficulty assessments
	3. Identification of systematic biases in model responses depending on the genre of materials.

**Result:** LLMs showed poor performance in zero-shot scenarios, but significant improvement when provided with examples, highlighting both their emerging capabilities and limitations.

**Limitations:** The study highlights that even the best models have systematic biases and struggle with accurately aligning material difficulty with cognitive abilities, showing the need for further training and evaluation methods.

**Conclusion:** ZPD-SCA serves as a foundation for assessing LLMs in educational applications, revealing the need for improved training to better align reading material difficulty with students' cognitive abilities.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore, significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.
